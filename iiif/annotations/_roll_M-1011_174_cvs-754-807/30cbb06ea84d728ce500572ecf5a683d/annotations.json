The present agency force is sufficient for our needs. No difficulty is experienced in maintaining proper order on the reservation. The Zunis are a peaceable people and give but little trouble and when small difficulties arise among them, the officers of the village render assistance in settling such disputes and it is but seldom that this office is called upon to maintain order among them. The most serious offences perpetrated by these Indians is the nonobservance of marital relations. The fact that when married by legal procedure, it is necessary to secure divorce through the court with the expense incidental to securing same, causes these Indians to follow the Indian custom marriage and then too frequent Indian custom divorce. There should be a law which would compel legal marriage among these Indians and some manner by which a superintendent could enforce such a law. The old Indian dances are indulged in among the Zunis from early fall until late spring with a few mixed in during the summer months. While the character of these dances are not such as to in any way injure the morals of the ones who indulge in them or who watch them, the damage is in the effect it has upon the individual Indian and the Indian children. While dancing, very little attention is paid to regular hours, either in eating or sleeping and this is especially bad for the Indian children from the Mission and Day Schools. As to the policy which should be pursued in regard to these dances, I believe it is chiefly one of education. Give the Indian something better to occupy his mind and his time and he will gradually get away from these dances as experience has shown this to be the case in many of the tribes. The protestant Mission is working among the returned students and the younger Indians, while at the Day School and at the agency headquarters, meetings are held for the returned students and as soon as our power plant is installed, it is hoped that a moving picture machine may be purchased., with other diversions to occupy the minds and attention of these people, they will gradually break away from their old customs and their dances. While the smaller children hardly ever join in these dances, the returned students and the larger children, not only view them, but participate in them. There are some dances that the children are the central actors, and in some, it is necessary for the girls, especially, to be in training for a certain period and there is some friction between the agency employees and the Indians because of our refusal to allow the children to absent themselves from school to prepare and indulge in these ceremonials and dances. - l-"
