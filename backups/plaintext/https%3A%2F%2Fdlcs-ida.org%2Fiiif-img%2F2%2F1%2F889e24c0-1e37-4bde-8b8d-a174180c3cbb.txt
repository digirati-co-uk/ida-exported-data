wagons, dolls, Indian rubber dolls, sling shots, tops, negro dolls,
puzzles and balls were made to give as gifts to their friends.
The making of a Christmas sand- table project delighted the class.
A house surrounded by trees and loaded with cotton snow was approached
by a Santa Claus( made of muslin) on a small wooden sleigh pulled
by eight clay reindeers.
other decorations such as chains, wreaths, pictures, bells,
tree decorations all lent a delightful tone to the room.
The children received a great deal of pleasure making Christmas
cards for their friends.
Tool Subjects:
The tool subjects were under- taken with much interest since it
centered around their attivities. Every new activity was discussed
and planned in their English classs In this procedure they acquired
many new English words, They learned to express their thoughts in
simple English sentences.
Many delightful Christmas pictures were shown to the children.
They eagerly expressed what they saw in the picture.
These thoughts
were written on the black- board and made into a reading chart by me.
These charts furnished the material for a primary reading lesson.
Games were played with phrase cards to establish a reading vocabulary
in each child's mind.
Often a hektographed copy of the chart was
given each child to be read individually.
