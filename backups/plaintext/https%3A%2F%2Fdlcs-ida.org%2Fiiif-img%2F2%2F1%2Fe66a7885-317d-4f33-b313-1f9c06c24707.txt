Fort Defiance, Arizona.
December 19th 1898.
The Honorable,
The Secretary of the Interior.
Sir:
I have the honor to submit herewith report of my inspec
tion of affairs and conditions at the Navajo Agency, Arizona, under
your instructions of September 6th 1898.
The extent of this reservation amounts to nearly 8,000,000
acres, or 16,000 square miles, with the Indians scattered over
every part of it rendering it very difficult for a thorough in
spection.
Not only the extent of territory but the roving dis
position of the Navajo Indians make it a difficult matter for the
Government to excercise any jurisdiction over its affairs, or
conduct its schools properly or with success.
The Indian Bu
reau has endeavored to establish schools at different points a
long distance a part, but with doubtful success for the reasons
above given and for reasons which will be submitted to the Honor
able Secretary.
The Navajo Indians occupying the Navajo reservation num
ber about 20,500, the largest assembly of a single tribe on any
one reservation in the United States under the control of the Gov
ernment with the exception of the Cherokee Nation.
They are a
wild, nomadic race scattered throughout their large reservation.
