Could This BeForever?Rolinda, Florena and Keri.This relationship I' ll treasure,your friendship forever!Sadness we sometimes feel,We ask, could this be for real?Honesty and caring we show,Every step of the way ourfriendshipwill grow!Standing by each other' s side,The roses that will soon havedied!Trusting one another,We ask could this be forever?Being here for you,I know our friendship is true!Depression you may sometimes feel,Then again laughing and smiling,Could this be for real?Smiling as a babe walks by,Laughing it off and giving a sigh.Wonderingabout our future,Could it be forever?Crying when it' s time tosay good- bye,Thinkingof the times,We make each other cry!I hate to see you go!The future we will have,We soon will know!Dreams die first,But memories are forever!Just remember the times of howlong,We stayed together!â€” Gayle Deutsawe22
