9- Hopimaterially hely improve the non- reservation schools.Supervisor Thompson made two trips out here the last halfof this fiscal year, looking into the necessity of additional schoolcapacity for the Navajo children of this reservation. He finallyrecommended a day school plant for Pinon district and a boardingschool plant for Indian Wells- on the Leupp reservation- for housingand schooling 250 of our Navajo children. I do not believe the dayschool at Pinon should be built not at least for two years, andonly then if present conditions there change for the better. TheIndians( Navajos) are very enthusiastic for the proposed boardingschool, but want it some place within Navajo territory on theirreservation, where there will be no question as to its use and whoit is for. They will support the boarding school to the limitgiving the Government every co- operation. There will be no questionat all as to its success. The Navajos here are strong for theirown boarding schools. This new school should be provided as soonas possible and carry Navajo children through the eighth grade, assuggested by the Frazier Sub- Conmittee. It is a very importantneed and, if built, should be built right and completely finishedand equipped before being used. The Navajos, as a body, are againsttrying out day schools for their use.E. K. M.
