our Indians, due mainly to the vigilance of thespecial officer who is assigned to this territory.Very few of the Indians of this reservation leave thereservation for the purpose of procuring intoxicatingliquor. A few of the younger ones are able to obtainliquor in the railroad towns, adjacent to the reservation,but as more prosecutions of bootleggers who sell tothe Indians are made, it will become increasinglydifficult for the Indians to obtain liquor. In thepast there has been excellent co- operation betweenthe authorities in the suppression of the liquor trafficamong Indians. I do not believe it would be advisable,or of any particular aid to me in the suppression of theliquor traffic, to have any of the employees, exceptthe Indian police, made special officers. I know ofno case where the Indians of this reservation made anyintoxicating beverage or preparation, and I am certainthat they do not use" peyote," or" me scal."I know of no instance where our Indians purchaseand use extracts or proprietary medicines for beveragepurposes, and I do not believe that additional Stateof Federal legislation is necessary to handle theliquor situation more effectively than it is now beinghandled. The Indians of this reservation gamble to acertain extent among themselves. It is believed, however,that this practice is more common when the Indians areidle, and if our present plans mature, in connection withincreased. farming activities, water development and soforth, the Indians will be kept busy and it is believedthat the practice of gambling will be reduced to aminnimum.- 3-
