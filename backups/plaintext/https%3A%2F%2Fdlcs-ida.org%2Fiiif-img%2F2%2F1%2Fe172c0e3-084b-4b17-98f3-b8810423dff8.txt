our Indians, due mainly to the vigilance of the
special officer who is assigned to this territory.
Very few of the Indians of this reservation leave the
reservation for the purpose of procuring intoxicating
liquor. A few of the younger ones are able to obtain
liquor in the railroad towns, adjacent to the reservation,
but as more prosecutions of bootleggers who sell to
the Indians are made, it will become increasingly
difficult for the Indians to obtain liquor. In the
past there has been excellent co- operation between
the authorities in the suppression of the liquor traffic
among Indians. I do not believe it would be advisable,
or of any particular aid to me in the suppression of the
liquor traffic, to have any of the employees, except
the Indian police, made special officers. I know of
no case where the Indians of this reservation made any
intoxicating beverage or preparation, and I am certain
that they do not use" peyote," or" me scal."
I know of no instance where our Indians purchase
and use extracts or proprietary medicines for beverage
purposes, and I do not believe that additional State
of Federal legislation is necessary to handle the
liquor situation more effectively than it is now being
handled. The Indians of this reservation gamble to a
certain extent among themselves. It is believed, however,
that this practice is more common when the Indians are
idle, and if our present plans mature, in connection with
increased. farming activities, water development and so
forth, the Indians will be kept busy and it is believed
that the practice of gambling will be reduced to a
minnimum.
