which could be under the eyes of the Laguna Sanatorium
physician
,
However, it appears that no funds are available
for renovating
,
remodeling
and maintaining
this general hospital at the present time.
In addi tion to the work of the Laguna Sanatorium
which is in
charge of a physician
and trained mirse, with a corps of five minor
employees
, there are three field physicians
at work among the Southem
Pra blos, For the first time since my incumbency
all of these positions
are filled through regular appointment
and I believe by capable and
conscientious
physicians
, there are five field matrons, each of whom
appears to be rendering good service in their respective
districts.
All of these employees- both pwysicians
and field matrons- seem to be
popular with the Pueblo Indians and are gradually
inducing the latter to
avail themselves
of modern methods in the prevention
and treatment
of
diseases
. Add itional funds are at the present time the most urgent need
for carry ing on the medical or health work of the reservation
and in the
day schools.
An additional
field matron, is needed at the Pueblo of Acoma, where
the opposition
to modern methods appears to be breaking down at this time.
This position should be established
without delay. When additional
funds
are available
another field matron should be assigned to the various
villages
of the Laguna district
, viz: 010 Laguna, Mesi ta, Casa Blanca,
Paraje and Seama.
A matron, nurse and laborer are also needed for the general hospital
at Laguna if same is to perform any considerable
service for the India s.
The work of the field matron has largely been directed along health
lines although attention
has been given to general home improvements
,
installation
of better sanitation
, instruction
in canning
of fruit,
better weaving and sewing. The field matrons visit all homes at least once
each week, and those whose district comprise but one village fine it
possible to make frequent visits.
When funds are available
the field matron at Bernalillo
and the ones
to be located in the Acoma and Laguna districts
should be provided with
improved equipment for covering their districts.
