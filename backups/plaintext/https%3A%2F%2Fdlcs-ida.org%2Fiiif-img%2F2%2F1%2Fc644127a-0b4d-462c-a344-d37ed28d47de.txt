â€¢ INDUSTRIES-( Cont'd.)
active part in getting together an exhibit of products both
from the school and reservation and this fair and ceremonial
is held the latter part of August and there is always a large
attendance from many distant points, and the exhibit last year
eclipsed anything I have ever seen at any fair, and I doubt
11 ever at any time in the past, there was as large or valuable
& collection of Indian arts and crafts and other products as
was shown at this ceremonial.
The only business councils which have been organized under
this jurisdiction are the community chapter organizations, and
we feel that the Indians have made a splendid beginning and it
has been the means for developing leaders in every locality,
and every three months we have planned to bring the officers to
gether for a joint meeting to discuss the accomplishments of
their respective chapters. Last year five chapters constructed
their community houses in which they hold their meetings once
each month, and at this time six more organizations have started
construction of similar meeting houses and they now feel the
urge of doing things collectively, though we find ourselves
handicapped and unable to render all assistance that they desire
in the purchase of material for these buildings and at this time
the Office should give serious consideration for the advancement
of funds to buy material for these buildings. All labor performed
is done gratuitously and the spirit they have shown in this
direction is certainly commendable.
