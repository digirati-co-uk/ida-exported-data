NARRATIVE
1919
Section V
Irrigation
Jicarilla
Agency
New Mexico
The two storage reservoirs used for irrigation
purposes have a total of approximately 1500 acre feet.
The waters of the two reservoirs are very alkaline and
are probably becoming more so from year to year.
The
LaJara Lake shows considerable" black alkali" and the
necessity for care in the use of this water was mentioned
in the section under industries.
Dulce Lake project was constructed under the super
vision of Superintendent of Irrigation John B. Harper,
1901-1903.
Extensions were made to this project in
1910-1911 carrying the water around the hill to a point
opposite the agency and from which point a twelve inch
syphon conducts the water across the valley to the oppo
site hill with laterals extending therefrom extending up
and down the Amargo Creek valley.
An extension of the
lateral down the valley was made this spring to serve
a new area of spring wheat.
Some work was required on the lateral systems under
the LaJara project to supply new area thrown under culti
vation this year.
The entire water storage can be used
on the irrigable area now under cultivation.
