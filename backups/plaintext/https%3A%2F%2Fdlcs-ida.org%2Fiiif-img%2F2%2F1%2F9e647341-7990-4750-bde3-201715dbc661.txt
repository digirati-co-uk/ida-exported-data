( 15)Section II. HEALTH:It is the opinion of certain authorities that the Pueblo Indianslikely never exceeded 30,000 in number, which proba bly included theZuni and the Hopi.of the Pueblos of New Mexico, under the SouthernAgency there remain about 6400.Two of the Pueblos are reduced to140 and 88 persons, Sia and Sandia respectively, because of theirholding themselves in complete isolation from the others, and arelatively few years of the devitalization that must occur due toinbreeding will see the last of the Sias and Sandias as the 19thcentury saw the last of the Pec 08.Only eight miles separate thePueblos of Jemez and Sia, yet there is no intermarriage.In 1621 the Franciscans claimed 16,000 converts among thePueblos of New Mexico.Wars, famine and pestilence operated thereafter to reduce these poople.Between 1779 and 1781 the Pue blogproper lost 5000 persons from smallpox. During 1918-1919 theSpanish influenza took a terrific toll of these people.During 1921,the Southern Pueblos Agency directed a new census and it is believednow possesses a very accurate list of the people. A comparisonbetween the census made by Governor Alencaster in 1805 and the1921 Agency census shows that in 116 years the Pueblos of theSouthern division have increased 38% in population, notwithstandingthe severe epidemics.
