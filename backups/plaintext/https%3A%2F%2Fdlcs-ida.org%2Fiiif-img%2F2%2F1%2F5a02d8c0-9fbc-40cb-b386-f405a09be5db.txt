Dorothy" Where are we going to hang our sweaters?"
Miss M.-" The boys have made some wooden pegs. Where
shall we put them?"
We tried putting them in the logs at the top
of the wall, but that was rather high. Roy put my coat
on the hook.

" Let's try it, and see if it works."
" It is not strong enough to hold a leather coat."
The pegs were strong enough to hold my coat and
smock, but they were too high for the girls to
reach.

Roy" I don't care, I will put them up."
The pegs were of different sizes, and some of them
were not made so they would fit into the logs. So the boys
tried to make some more like the ones we decided were
the best.
We always try to decide each morning what is impor
tant for us to do that day. Then each child is given a
choice to work on the things he is most interested in.
We had to work on the skins. Some were ready to come out
of the tanning solution; others had to be gotten ready to
put in.
We had just had the water piped up to our hogan,
so Lindy suggested we cover over the pipe with dirt.
The children had become interested in making a
bird bath like the one they had read about in the Weekly
Reader. Some of the boys wished to work on that.
