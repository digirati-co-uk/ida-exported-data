Annual Report, 1926.
San Juan Agency
available, the swings and slides are never idle except
when the girls are all required to be otherwise engaged
Tennis, volley ball, base ball, and foot ball are played
by the boys; volley ball by both girls and boys. There is
not suificient play ground equipment at the San Juan School
and Ione whaefer at the IMesa Unit altho steps are now
being taken to provide for the latter named institution
The needs of the Shiprock Schools summed up are as
follows:
( e) an imrpoved water supply
( b) drainage,
( c) protection from San Juan River flood- waters
( a) additional class- roons and a gym, at the San Jen School,
( e) a gymnasium at the Mesa Unit that could also be used
as an assembly room,
( 1) a concrete ide- walk connecting the two institutions,
( f) play ground equipment at both schools
Employees, almost without exception, have been efficient
and loyal, nor has there be en any evidence of lack of hard
mony and cooperation among them. Accommodetions for en
ployees are for the most part anple and comfortable
An attempt is made at all times to adapt the school
to the needs of the Indians, the Health Program is given
a prominent place in the work; much attention is given to
instruction in the use of sceles, for, later in life, ii
the pupil resides on the reservation, practically all income
will be derived from the sale of lanbs, wool, pelts, blankets,
pinon nuts, etc, all of which are sold by weight; special
attention is given to sheep and lamb culture and blanket
weaving, and at Toadlena, to the dairy goat industry.
It would appear that Government schools will be needed
on the Nevajo jurisdictions for many years to come, at least
on the San Juan jurisdiction, for there is little point of
contact between the Navajos and the Whites and no inter
mingling of the races. Of the 650 pupils now in school on
this jurisdiction there is not one that is recognized as
being of mixed blood. There are two that might be mistaken
for mixed bloods, but not one that is so recognized. Practic
ally the e only points of contact are through the Government
schools, the Government employees, the Missionaries, and
the Traders, and through those that leave the reservation
to secure employment
