The Honorable
Commissioner Indian Affairs,
Washington.
Sir:
I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
office letter re Navajo Indians dated Aug. 6,1929,
requesting an estimate of the number of deaths
which have occurred during 1929, among the Navajos
under this jurisdiction.
The year 1929 has not been as bad for these
people as was the year 1928, no epidemies having og
curred; therefore the deaths would be somewhat
eqaal in number to the births, namely 249.
The report of contagion and infection and
live births in the hospital has already been
covered in the statistical section of the Navajo
census submitted.
Yours respectfully
Youre rekpotr√†
