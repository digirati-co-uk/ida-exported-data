dated April 27,1897, concerning the matter
of irrigation within
the Navajo Indian Reservation, located principally in the Territo
ries of Arizona and New Mexico.
He refers to the present status and condition of the work
there, expresses confidence in the ability and in tegrity of Supt.
of Irrigation George Butler, and recommends the appointment of some
good, honest, practical
man who has had experience in irriga tion
work to tako charge of the se ditches when completed by Supt. Butler.

that this office received, by Department reference, a report, dated
