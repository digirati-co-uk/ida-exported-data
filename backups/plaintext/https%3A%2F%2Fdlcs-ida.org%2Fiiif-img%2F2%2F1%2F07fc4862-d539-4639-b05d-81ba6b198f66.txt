- 14Section IV- Industriesagainst selling stock to unscrupulous buyers of all kinds atany time of the year. This matter is having most earnestattention and every thing possible will be done to protectthem.Not one acre of the reservation is leased for eitheragricultural or grazing purposes to whites and in addition tothis the Navajos, on their own violition have for some yearsleased a number of townships on the public domain, where theSanta Fe Ry. owns every alternate township, for grazing purposes. This is necessary owing to the fact that they havelived for many years in that section and a single allotmentwould be of little value to them without other grazing privileges.There is no tribal herd on this reservation, all stockbeing owned individually. The up- breeding of both cattle andsheep, as heretofore noted, is receiving most careful attentionbut as the number of head each of sheep and cattle is large itwill take a consti erable length of time and a great number ofimproved male animals to bring the entire number up to a higherstandard.However, this matter is being helped by extensivepurchases of improved breeding stock by the Navajos themselves.This reservation is not adapted to the dairy industryOwing to lack of forage. It is a fair grazing country duringmost years.- dairy barn is being erected at the Navajoschool and more and better stock will shortly be secured.
