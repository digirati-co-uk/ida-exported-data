Annual Report.HealthSanta Fe Sohooland AgencyI do not consider it advisable or expodiont toattempt to provide sanitary privies for the use of theIndians in the several pueblos, If such an attempt weremade and privias erected, either of the L. R, S. type ordry earth kind, it would be necessary to set aside a con.siderable amount of money for the Omployment of laborersto see that the buildings wers kept sanitary. I considerit extreroely doubtful if labor of this sort could behired at any price. I am very sure it would be an impossibility to secure the services of an Indian for this pur.pose. Under the present conditions the excrement is ramoved by scavenger dogs, and as I feel it would be an im.possibility to insure the use of any sanitary privy by theIndians, steps taken in that direction in the erection ofprivies of any type would make the situation of disposingof excrement in the publos worse than it now is,There is, however, an urgent necossity of providing sanitary closets or outhouses for the day schoolsat San Juan, San Ildefonso, Picuris and Sia, I do notbelieve the L, R, S, privy is adapted for use in this clima to under the conditions which prevail here. A flushwater system, provided for the outhouses at the Cochitischool plant, seems feasible, and I foal, where practicalthrough adequate supply of water, is a most expedientsolution of this problem. No water supply is availablefor this purpose at Picuris, and screened dray oartholodets should be provided, If funds are available, Iwould recommend a plush system, similar to that at Cochiti,be installed at Taos, San Juan and San Ildefonso; otherwise,I think the dry earth closets will screened are best adaptedin providing sanitary outhouses at the day schools. Theneed of having these closets sanitary is readily apparent,1f our day schools are to stand as models in teaching theIndians sanitation in conjunction with other educationalwork.
