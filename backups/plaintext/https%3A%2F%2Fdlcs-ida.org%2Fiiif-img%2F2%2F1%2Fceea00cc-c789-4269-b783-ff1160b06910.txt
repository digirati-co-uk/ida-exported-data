Jicarilla Indian School,
V.Field- Forestry:
All timber, on the allotted lands of this reser
vation, was reserved and held as tribal property. The same should
be sold in the stump, small sales for general market. And the
timber on unallotted lands should be sold in the same manner and
included in the same sales.
The methodo of: legging, will depend upon the lo
cation of mill or mills operated by the purchaser of timber.
The present market price is higher, than preced
ing years, as timber in this locality is becoming scarce, from
operations of numerous sawmills for years past. All indications
are favorable for increase of price on stumpage.
Location of area, most liable to fires, is adjacent
to the Denver and Rio Grande railroad, in the north- east part of
the reservation.
