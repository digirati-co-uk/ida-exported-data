Leupp School& AgencyLeupp, ArizonaFiscal year closing, June 30, 1926Section IIHealthThe health standard at the Leupp School during the pastyear has been good. The water for some stic use is satisfactory,although it contains a high per cent of mineral elements. Thehealth condition among the employees has been good. A trachomacampaign was conducted last fall which did much to clean up thetrachoma. The trachoma condition at the school has been followedup again this spring and will be continued this fall again whichshould practically eliminate trachoma from the Leupp School. Atrachoma campaign will also be conducted on the Reservation amongthe Reservation Indians which should be of great benefit in stamping out the disease. The Indians as a whole appear to be in goodhealth, although there are no statistics at hand which would showthe death rate, prevelance of disease, or facts as to the healthconditions.There is a clear indication, however, that the Indianshave not yet progressed to the point where they call for theReservation doctor in case of illness. Numerous cases ha ve cometo attention where the medicine man was used exclusively in 111nesses of the most serious nature. In fact since May 1, 1926,there has only been one call for a doctor, and this call was inconnection with a case of tuberculosis which was in its last stage.
