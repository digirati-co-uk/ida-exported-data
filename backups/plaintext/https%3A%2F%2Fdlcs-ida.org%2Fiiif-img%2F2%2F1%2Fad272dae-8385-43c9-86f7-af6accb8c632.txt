It has had TribalCounciis for the last ten years. These Tribal Councils were originated by some Zuni boyswho were displeased with the conduct of their tribesman. They asked for permission toorganize themselves into a group for the purpose of looking after the behavior and moralconduct of their own tribesmen at the school. Permission was granted, and during the yearfollowing, the Zunis were 100 percent in conduct. Other tribes followed the next year, andat present the following Tribal councils exist for the express purpose of assisting in schoolgovernment:The Laguna Boys' CouncilJemez Boys' CouncilThe Hopi Boys' CouncilZuni Boys' CouncilThe Apache Boys' CouncilNavajo Boys' CouncilNorthern Pueblo Boys' CouncilIsleta Boys' CouncilAcoma Boys' CouncilStray Boys' CouncilLaguna Girls' CouncilZuni Girls' CouncilHopi Girls' CouncilNavajo Girls' CouncilApache Girls' CouncilIsleta Girls' CouncilNorthern Pueblo Girls' CouncilStray Girls' CouncilJemez Girls' CouncilAcoma Girls' CouncilThe Tribal Councils meet once a month where each council discusses matters relatingits tribe.
