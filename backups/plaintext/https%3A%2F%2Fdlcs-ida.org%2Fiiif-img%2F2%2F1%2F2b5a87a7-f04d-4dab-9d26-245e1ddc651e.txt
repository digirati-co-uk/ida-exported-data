as a reservation for the benefit of the Indians which are now upon
the Public Domain.
It is doubtful if such a move could ever be carried
out with the politicians of New Mexico as they are opposed to giving
the Indians any more land in this state, but this move would be a
protective measure and insure the Indians for the range, for with the
white stockmen once in control, it will mean that the Indians will
be more and more restricted in the range of their herds with less
chance to increase their number.
