In reply to:
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
INDIAN SCHOOL SERVICE,
OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT,
Santa Fe, New Mexico, December 13, 1898.
Hon, Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
Washington, D.c..
Sir:
I have the honor to acknowledgb receipt of office lotter, Finance,
54228, '98 dated December 8, 1898, and in answer to the same would stato
as follows.
In my letter of the 20th shimo esking that the superintendent
of the Albuquerque School be notified by your offico to ship us 1 amp
chimneys and wicks, I did not intend to convoy to you the idea that the
Albuquerque School had received our years supply of thoso goods, instead,
their
I wished to inform you that they had received full supply.
Some little time ago I visited the Albuquerque School, and inspec
ted their Electric light plant, and while there was informed that they
had a great supply of chimneys, wicks etc. for which they had no use,
and as our supply was entirely exausted, and as we are greatly in need
of them for immediato us., I thought by this arrangement I could re
ceive a supply of these articles
in much shorter time than if they
more ordered by your offion frora the contractor, and also without in
rring any additional exponse to the Department, except the freight
from Albuquerque to Santa Po, d. Mox,
