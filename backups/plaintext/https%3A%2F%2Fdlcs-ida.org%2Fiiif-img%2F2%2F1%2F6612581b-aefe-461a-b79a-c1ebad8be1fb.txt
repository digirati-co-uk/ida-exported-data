service among the pueblos, as compared with preceding years. A registered
nurse has been stationed at the large pueblo of Isleta. This nurse also
makes regular visits, on designated days, to the pueblos of Sandia and
Santa Ana. During the year a registered nurse was also stationed at the
pueblo of Jemez, employed by the New Mexico Association on Indian Affairs.
She also serves the pueblo of Sia. There are field matrons stationed at
the pueblos of San Felipe and Paguate, and one field matron detailed as
nurse and matron at the Trachoma Hospital. It is the duty of these em
ployees to visit all of the Indian homes to instruct in sanitation, care
of infants, and treat minor cases of illness, and keep the field doctors
informed of any illness in their jurisdiction.
It is recommended that a field nurse be stationed at Acomita
and that the field matron position at San Felipe be changed to a field
nurse, who will have the pueblos of San Felipe, Santa Ana, and Sandia.
This will confine the present field nurse to Isleta, which is the largest
single village in the jurisdiction.
With the assistence of the employees above mentioned, taken in
connection with my own weekly visits, on designated days, to all the eight
pueblos mentioned, and the recent trachoma survey and skillful eye work
of Dr. and Mrs. Ross, it is considered that the most urgent needs of carry
ing on the health work during the year have been well met, and that no
additional health worker is needed for the above mentioned pueblos of
the Southern jurisdiction- except a dentist.
except a dentist. And last, but not least,
my Superintendents have given whole- hearted co- operation and support in
all matters pertaining to the health program.
