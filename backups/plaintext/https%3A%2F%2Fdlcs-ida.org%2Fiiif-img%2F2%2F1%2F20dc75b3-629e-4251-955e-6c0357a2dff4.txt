19- Hopiagreed to for the first year's work- 1932. This money has alreadybeen provided and the work will soon start. This is a veryencouraging thing, for it will put water this year where there islittle of it and where it is greatly needed, The Indians havenotified the Indian Office of their wishes to aid and co- operatein every way on this development, which they greatly appreciate.At this writing our water supply all over thereservation seems lower than usual; at this time of the year andat several places, where we usually have a fairly good supply, weare without water. We should start water- development work here atonce.Just about one- half of the reservation is surveyed.There are about 50 townships yet to be surveyed, and it should bedone just as soon as possible. Of course, no allotments could bemade until the reservation is completely surveyed and the boundariesof it established properly and marked definitely. Our boundariesare not defined enough to allow of their identification. Theyshould be located and marked. Il segregation takes place it wouldbe well to have the reservation fully surveyed and marked.There is no mining on this reservation other than forcoal used by the agency and schools, and for individual Indians, asthey individually mine to suit themselves. We have fine coal andplenty of it. Our coal for use at all schools and agency is minedat a cost of about$ 4.50 per ton at the mouth of our mines. Weoperate three mines. We have a white miner supervising this work.All the other mine work is done by Indians.011 has never been prospected for on this reservation.Tribal income from mineral sources is nil- only thatwhere an Indian takes a load of coal to town and sells it on hisown responsibility.E.
