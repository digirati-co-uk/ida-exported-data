- 21ANNUAEL REPORT.ZUNI INDIA SCHOOL.WARRATIV.SECTIO...... V11...... CONTRACTS.L. Business councils are from time to time head with committed ropresenting the tribe. This committee is composed of a Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and seven" Teneantees" or district representatives fromOthe severaldistricts of the reservation. These men are not electedby the people but appointed by the spiritual men of the tribe. As arule they are fairly intelligent and reliable but unfortunately, thisyear, they are not even representative of their people in this regard.Their services are of no value to me or the tribe. They are reactionaries of the worst sort; a hinderance to the progress of the tribe andin my official duties instead of a help. If people of this calibrecontinue in these positions, I do not consider it advisable to allowa continuation of same. If this body were looted by the people fora term of one year, they could be of some value in taking the placeof Indian Courts, etc., and in assisting in the carrying out of thepolicy of the superintendent.2. The Indians of this reservation are self- supporting. They are cts-1 zen Indians. They have no tribal trust funds and recieve no annuities.
