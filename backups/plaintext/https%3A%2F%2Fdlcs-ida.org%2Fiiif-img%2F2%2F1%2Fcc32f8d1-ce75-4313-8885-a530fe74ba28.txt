The woms this year in the Kindergarten clę; was carried onentirely through units and activities. The objectives and theactivities as listed in the curriculum for this level as wellas all the processes were derived from the units carried on inthis level. These units were selected as the best possibleapproaches for acquainting these children, who untii this currentyear had had no actual experience with the English language orthe English speaking people, with the every day things founddirectiy around them in their new enviornment, linking up thenew experiences with the experiences with which the childrenwere already familiar. The units have been selected becausethey could give the children usable English as well as takingin the vocabulary list for this level.The first unit used this year was e Farm unit which hadincorporated in it « Home unit, a Food unit, and a Nature unit.As Home life and its activities are among the chief interests ofof a child this unit merely carried on the enjoyable experiencesof the children in a language that was unfamiliar to them.Of course the little girls were very much interested inthe dolls in the classroom and never tired playing with them.This seemed to be their main interest from the start and neverdied down throughout the entire school year.

He very crudely measured hiswagon with a stick and sawed the boards for his sh ed. Needlessto say they were not sawed evenly and the shed was a littlelopsidded but it was a very good place to put his wagon when theschool day was over. The knot holes in the shed were patchedwith small pieces of tin and a door of tin was finally put onthe sh ed. Other sheds followed of course. The boy who had firstmade the shed was not quite satisfied with his wagon so he puta seat in the front of it and used one of the small rag dollsfor a passenger at times.After visiting the farm, which we visited for the purposeof helping with the hervesting of the corn, the children seemed
