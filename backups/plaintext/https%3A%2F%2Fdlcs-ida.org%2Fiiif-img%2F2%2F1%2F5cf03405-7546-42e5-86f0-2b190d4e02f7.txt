Indian dancing among the Pueblo Indians has been given much
publicity. I have' not found any reason to be alarmed during my stay
here over the effeot of these dances on the morals of the people.
Nevertheless, the dances are symbolical and have to do with the Pagan
religious ceremonies of the Indian. Their religion being phallic in
its nature, gives rise to immumerable conjectures by those who only
have a superfluous knowledge of the significance of their various
ceremonies. Such superstitious ceremonies are harmful to the tribes
in the degree in which the old people in power are able to influence
the younger partially educated members and take them back to the old
ways and customs.
In some Pueblos the people are rapidly getting
away from these old religious ideas and their dances have little more
than social significance. However, there are Pueblos where, unless
protection is promised the younger generation, their lot is difficult
indeed and they have no hope of holding office among their people until
they submit to the forms and ceremonies of the ruling class. This lust
for power is a most potent factor in taking them back to the old ways,
and until the Pueblo cacique and governor are held strictly to account
by the United States Government it will continue to be so.
The Pueblo Indians of this jurisdiction are married legally and
where separations occur divorces may be obtained. I am not authorized
to issue marriage licenses to the Indians. They are, as a whole,
nominally Catholic and go to the local priest who secures their
marriage licenses for them and performs the marriage ceremony.
