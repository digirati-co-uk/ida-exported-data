Dear Madam:-
I am just in receipt or your letter of the 18th instant,
concerning your transfer to the Albuquerque School, and in reply, I
Would inferre. you that I think it advisable to inform the Indian orrice
of your decision as soon as possibl 06
Your request for a transfer to Oklahoma, I am sure, was favorably
considered by the Indian orrice, but there was probable, no vacancy
there just at this time.
If you accept the position at Albuquerque, it is probable that
you may be able to secure a transfer to Oklahoma serere the schoo1
seseten op nc- in september.
Very respectrully,
Superintendent,
