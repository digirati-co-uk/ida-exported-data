14NARRATIVE.Population.There are no business committees except that consisting ofthe Judges and police who meet monthly to discuss matters of generalinterest and hold court. At these meetings influential members ofthe tribe frequently attend and through them I have establishedintelligent and friendly relations with the Indians under my jurisdiction.It is difficult here to reach the individual Indiansin any other way as there are so few employes who ever come in contact with the Indiansin their homes.Since taking charge I have been in every part of my extensivejurisdiction in a general way, except the Tenebi to, lying to the northwest and partly on the Moqui reservation. Of course it has beenimpossible to do this in the intimate way in which a Farmer shouldgo over a local area.There have been no serious disturbances among the Indiansunder my charge and very little drinking or gambling.I think a great deal of these Na va jo, and I am glad to believethey like and respect me. We are getting along very decently, and Ihope I am helping them along toward ultimate good citizenship.
