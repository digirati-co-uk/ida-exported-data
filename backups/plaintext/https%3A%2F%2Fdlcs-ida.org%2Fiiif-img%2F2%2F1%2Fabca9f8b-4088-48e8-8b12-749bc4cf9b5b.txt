By inbreeding, the Navajo sheep and cattle have deteriorated
and any plan for their industrial advancement must include as a
matter of first importance the improvement of their stock by up
breeding
.
Thousands of acres of good grazing land are now useless be
cause of lack of water for stock purposes.
Shallow wells can be drilled
and supplied with windmills which will furnish adequate water for
stock through these sections of the reservation and this is a matter
which is considered most important at this time, 1f an opportunity
is to be afforded for increasing the herdasof the Navajo on this
reservation. These wells can be drilled at a comparably small cost
in consideration
of the value of the grazing land which will thus
be available.
The settlement of the land under the Hogback irrigation canal
will provide several hundred Indian families with small farms where
they can raiso wheat, corn, vegetables and fruit for their ow con
sumption and forage for their stock during the winter months.
Ex- students and the more progressive younger Indiens are being
settled on this project as rapidly as possible. By close super
vision, which is possible under these conditions, a farming community
will be developed, which will be a practical demonstration of what
may be accomplished through intensive cultivation.
