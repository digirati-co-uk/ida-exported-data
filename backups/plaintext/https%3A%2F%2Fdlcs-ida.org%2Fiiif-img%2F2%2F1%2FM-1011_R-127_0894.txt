B SANNUAL REPORT SANTA FE BOARDING SCHOOL, JUNE 30. 1923NARRATIVE SECTIONSection IIHealthIn a very general way, it may be said that thehealth conditions at the Santa Fe school during the FiscalYear 1. 923 were satisfactory Nevertheless it seems to methat the after- effects of the persistently recurring influenza epidemics of the past few years and perhaps ofan epidemic of measles, too were very evident Out ofthe 431 pupils enrolled in the course of the entire schoolyear about a dozen broke down before the end of theschool year and had to be sent home or to a sanatoriumThe feeding, clothing, housing, and climatic conditionsWere if anything, better during 1922- 23 than in anyyear previous But in spite of all that, the number ofpupils who broke dowm was too high I am sure that, if1925- 24 should show a smaller number of break- downs, the nearsurmise that what has happened during 1922- 23 is due toafter- effects of influenza etc is correctDuring 1922- 23 there were no epidemics of anysort worth mentioning We had a diphtheria scare inearlf June when one of the teachers was taken dowmBut I had nearly all the pupils treated within a fewdays with antiaOphther√©tic serum and no more casesdevelopedWe have a hospital here on the school groundswith a very highly efficient and conscientious nurse inchange Also, the contract physician who comes outthrice a week and as much oftener as he is needed, isone of the best medical men in the State In so far aspossible, I make an effort to have this hospital functionnot only as a school hospital but to a certain appreciableextent as a general hospital for the treatment of IndiansFor example, two Indian girls who have been totally unableto do any school work have been receiving daily treatmentfor months past for trachoma and have shown marked im.provement Tor a couple of years past, it has been mypolicy never to turn away any applicant for enrollmentwho was suffering from trachome.
