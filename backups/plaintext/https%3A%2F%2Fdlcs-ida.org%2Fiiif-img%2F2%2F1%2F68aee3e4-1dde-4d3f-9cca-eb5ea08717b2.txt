Leupp Training School.( 8)Education Div., SCHOOLS SECTION( continued).GEOFINDIANRECEIVEDAUG311910AFFAIREof this will be about$ 60, 000. We have no School farm, but oneshould be provided.Four wells have been sunk, which seem toprovide a sufficient amount of water for the School farm, alsoenough to water the School campus. If pumping machinery is providedfor these wells during the present year-- the total cost of whichwill be about$ 4, 000-- the School farm can then be operated, not onlyas a School farm but also as an Agency Demonstrationfarm. It willprovide vegetables for the School, also subsistence for a dairy hera,which should be provided, and will give employment under instructionto the larger boys of the School.With regard to the employees, it is my opinion that the majorityof the school employees at this place are underpadd. The cost ofliving in this desert, it being necessary to pay exorbitant railroadfreight rates on everythingreceived, is very high, and employeesarerequired to pay high rates for railroad fares as well. There shouldbe a material increase in the salary for practicallyevery positionat the School.We need additionalemployeesin the capacityofIndian assistants. Two of these should be providedat about$ 480. 00 a year each.We have had no graduates as yet from this School.The Schoolhas been in operationonly about 1- 1/ 2 years, and the childrenareall small, very few of them having attendeda school before; andsome years must elapse before we have graduates.There is one Mission School underthe control of this Agency.It is of small capacity, only eight or nine children being cared for.
