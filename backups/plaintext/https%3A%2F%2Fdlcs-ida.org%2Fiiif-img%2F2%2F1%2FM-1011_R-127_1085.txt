My dear Mr. Commissioners
Section III schools
The capacity of the Santa Fe school for the year just
closed was 450, the capacity having been increased to 500 for the
year, 1928- 1923. The total enrollment for the year ending June 30
1928 was 540 wi th an average daily attendance of 490. More pupils
could have been enrolled but facilities were inadequate
With the completion of the boys new dorm tory, which
should not require more than 3 or 4 more weeks and the remodeling of
one wing of the boys' old dormitory into small boys quarters and
which is now under way, this school can take care of 300 boys so far
as dormitory space is concerned, very comfortably
New boilers are needed and a new boiler house should be
constructed near the present boiler house. Like the present bakery,
most of the boiler room space is underground. The old boiler house
could be utilized for storing coal
L
Since it is not the plan of the Office to include the
10th grade, this school can get along fairly well without more class
rooms by making use of the library, but the principal has no office
except a small room upstairs which is very inconvenient. Four or six
class rooms could be added to the present school building at no great
expense and it should be done. This would enable me to provide an
office for the principal, and it would make it possible to make more
use of the library
There was a decided improvement in the academic work for
the year just closed, over the work of the year previous. With the
introduction of several new teachers and a new principal, the pupils
seemed to get new inspiration. There was a very happy and contented
feeling among the entire student body. Very few desertions and very
11ttle trouble, among the students, of any kind.
