Indian SchoolSanta Fe, New MexicoJuly 11, 1928The Commissioner of Indian AffairsWashington, D.My dear Mr. CommissionersSection III schoolsThe capacity of the Santa Fe school for the year justclosed was 450, the capacity having been increased to 500 for theyear, 1928- 1923. The total enrollment for the year ending June 301928 was 540 wi th an average daily attendance of 490. More pupilscould have been enrolled but facilities were inadequateWith the completion of the boys new dorm tory, whichshould not require more than 3 or 4 more weeks and the remodeling ofone wing of the boys' old dormitory into small boys quarters andwhich is now under way, this school can take care of 300 boys so faras dormitory space is concerned, very comfortablyNew boilers are needed and a new boiler house should beconstructed near the present boiler house. Like the present bakery,most of the boiler room space is underground. The old boiler housecould be utilized for storing coalLSince it is not the plan of the Office to include the10th grade, this school can get along fairly well without more classrooms by making use of the library, but the principal has no officeexcept a small room upstairs which is very inconvenient. Four or sixclass rooms could be added to the present school building at no greatexpense and it should be done. This would enable me to provide anoffice for the principal, and it would make it possible to make moreuse of the libraryThere was a decided improvement in the academic work forthe year just closed, over the work of the year previous. With theintroduction of several new teachers and a new principal, the pupilsseemed to get new inspiration. There was a very happy and contentedfeeling among the entire student body. Very few desertions and very11ttle trouble, among the students, of any kind.
