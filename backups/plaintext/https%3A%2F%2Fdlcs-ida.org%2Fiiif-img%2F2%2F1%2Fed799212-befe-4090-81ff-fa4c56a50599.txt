I thoroughly approve of Health and English heading the list ofthe major fields of life activities. These are the two greatestneeds of the Nava joes. What can be more important than that theylearn the proper foods for building strong, disease- resistant bodies, or that they have thorough training in personal hygiene andsanitation, camp sanitation, first aid, etc.?If they are to carry on business intelligently with the traders or to compete successfully with the white man in our industriallife, what will be of greater value than an understanding of English and the ability to speak it?Though this does not belong in the evaluation of the curriculum, I might add here that a thorough English course is impossiblewhere the grades are too large to permit of individual work in Srenunciation and vocabulary drills.Defects:My greatest criticism of this level is that in many cases itis too abstract. For instance, here are several very general object" To be kind in thought and deed to all living things"," TObe polite"," To use good manners". It seems to me it would be moreeffective to cite particular instances in which to show these traits;such as" To feed and water pets regularly"," To say' Thank you'"" to eat slowly".Since a study of the community is generally conceded to be adapted to this level, I would divide this objective" To learn relation of the home to the community" into these specifio objectives:" To understand and appreciate the work of the community in meetingthe need for shelter";" To understand and appreciate the work ofthe community in meeting the need for food"; and such other thingsas communication, protection, health, and recreation, etc.There seems to be too much repetition, also. For instance," To learn need of keeping regular sleeping hours", and" To sleepand rest sufficiently seem to me to be about the same thing.brush the teeth regularly", and" To learn the proper diet for buildud end care of teething teeth" are alsoPT6vetitions." TOIn this particular level, D- 1, I would suggest that those objectives embracing conservation of natural resources, agrioulture,and childcare be taught through practical demonstration outside- 2-
