NARRATIVE12CONTINUEDSection 4.IndustriesAnnual Report1914JlcarillaAgencyNew Mexico.With the exception of considerable hay cut, the cropswere almost a total failure in the fall of 1913.Weatherconditions were such that experienced farmers in the northernpart of New Mexico suffered as seriously as the Indians.Thewinter following was the most severe for several years, anait is estimated that 350 Indian ponies died on the range.When allotments were made all of the agricultural landscontaining meadows of any considerable size had been squattedon or taken as homesteads by Mexicans.I believe that thebest use that could be made of the proceeds of the timbersales would be the purchase of some or all of these lands,and the purchase of sheep.The Indians would then be able tostack large quantities of hay to take care of their stock ina severe winter.Many of the Indians have been persuaded toconsider such a purchase and all agree that it would be agood thing for the tribe, and would be willing to use theirfunds in that way.In spite of adverse conditions and the loss of theirgrain crop last year the Indians again plowed their allotments this spring and sewed about 11,000 pounds of oats.Prospects at this time are for a good harvest.
