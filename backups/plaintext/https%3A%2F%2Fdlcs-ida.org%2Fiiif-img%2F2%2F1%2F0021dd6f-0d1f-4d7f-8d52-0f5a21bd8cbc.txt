wraps, so we put more pegs in the logs, Wilson G. rubbed
sandpaper
over the pegs to mako them smoother,
Some of the boys suggested
that we tan the skins to
We looked at the skins, and found that most of them
were not soft enough around the edges. We decided
that
we had not rated them up well enough
to get all the edges
next to the wet sawdust. We rolled all the skins over
again, and tied them with wire. We thought it best to
leave them another
day. Some of the boys ground up the

The boys seem so anxious to take the stools and
tables out. Every day they mention
it.
Roy" We sit on the floor."
Marcelino
" When are we going to sit on the floor?"
Miss M." When do you think we should?"
Marcelino
" Right away." Maybe Friday we take out the
stools." We don't like to sit on stools."
Andy
" We better wait until our skins are ready

Miss M." Why do you think you would rather sit on the
floor than on the stools?"
Andy" Because we are Indians, and we sit on the floor at
home. We like it."
Byrd" Where are you going to sit, Miss Martin?"
Maybe you have to stand to write on the board."
Andy" Maybe you sit on the stool, or on the skins."
