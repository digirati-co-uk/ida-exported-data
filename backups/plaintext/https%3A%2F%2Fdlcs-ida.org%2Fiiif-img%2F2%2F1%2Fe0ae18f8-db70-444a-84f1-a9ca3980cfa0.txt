diction.
In reply there to please be advised I am forwarding
herewith the census and complete statistical report ap
pertaining thereto which I will ask the office to file
with the Hopi census and statistics transmitted to the

These two statistical reports and census now covers
all of the Hopi and Navajo Indians under this jurisdiction
