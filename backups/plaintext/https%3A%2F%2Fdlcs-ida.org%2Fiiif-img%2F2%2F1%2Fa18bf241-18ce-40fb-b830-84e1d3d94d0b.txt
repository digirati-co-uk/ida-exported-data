Law and Order( continued)
Hopi Indian Agency
The very best way to handle the liquor situation here on
this reservation is through the establishment of a place for a
white police and putting in that position an efficient officer.
No additional legislation, State or Federal, is necessary. Give
me& good white officer and with the help of the native police
we will prevent any unsatisfactory liquor conditions and prose
oute all violators of the Federal laws. As it is now it is im
possible to control the situation,
It is the opinion that national prohibition has made for
worse oonditions among the Indians so far as liquor introduction
is concerned. This is caused by home made brew and the peddling
thereof.
I do not see any use of drugs among these Indians,
These Indians do not make any liquors of any kind.
Gambling probably is the worst practice among these people,
if you can call it a crime. It has been a permanent feature of
their home life for many years, especially among the Navajo8.
They gamble at all hours of the night and day, and in many ways.
Every native policeman is under strict orders to prevent
gambling and to bring in the offenders. They are tried before
the Nava jo bouncil. Here again we are met with the great handi
cap of having no authority or law back of us to prosecute this
work or to give merited punishment to those caught gambling. We
destroy all paraphemalia that we take possession of.
So far as I know there has been no important decision during
the past fiscal year by either State or Federal courts, affecting
our Indlang.
There has been no new legislation enacted by Arizona during
the past year involving liquor traffic among Indians.
Respectfully submitted,
