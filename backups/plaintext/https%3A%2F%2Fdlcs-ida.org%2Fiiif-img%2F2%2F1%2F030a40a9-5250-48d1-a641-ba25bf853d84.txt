This morning Wilson G. finished sandpapering the
wooden pegs. Harry offered to stain them. He didn't get
them quite finished so Kee did the rest. When they are
dry, we will have places to hang our wraps.
The boys were anxious to start the tanning process.
We talked over our plans for preparing the skins, and how
they were to be tanned. We always try to make plans for
work
our before we begin it. We seem to get more accomplished
11 each one knows what their work is to be.
Of course
emergencies come up, and we have to call for volunteers.
We removed the wet sawdust from the skins. Then
the boys scraped the skins with knives and stones to re
move the fat and fleshy part. We measured out the salt,
borax, alum, and dissolved it in the warm water.
We used
the following for each skin.
Borax 1 Oz. Salt 1/2 lb. Powdeded alum lb.
When the above ingredients had been dissolved
in the water, we poured in the flour until we had a thick
paste.
We found it took a 24 lb. sack of flour for about
three and a half skins. We spread this paste over the
flesh side of the skins with a brush and folded up the skins,
and laid thom away in a dry place. We did not have enough
flour, vo we will have to work again to- morrow to finish
tanning the skins we have ready for the tanning paste.
