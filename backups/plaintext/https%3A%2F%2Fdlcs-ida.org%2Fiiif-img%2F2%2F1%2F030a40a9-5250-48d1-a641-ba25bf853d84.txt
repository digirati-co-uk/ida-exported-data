0March 29This morning Wilson G. finished sandpapering thewooden pegs. Harry offered to stain them. He didn't getthem quite finished so Kee did the rest. When they aredry, we will have places to hang our wraps.The boys were anxious to start the tanning process.We talked over our plans for preparing the skins, and howthey were to be tanned. We always try to make plans forworkour before we begin it. We seem to get more accomplished11 each one knows what their work is to be.Of courseemergencies come up, and we have to call for volunteers.We removed the wet sawdust from the skins. Thenthe boys scraped the skins with knives and stones to remove the fat and fleshy part. We measured out the salt,borax, alum, and dissolved it in the warm water.We usedthe following for each skin.Borax 1 Oz. Salt 1/2 lb. Powdeded alum lb.When the above ingredients had been dissolvedin the water, we poured in the flour until we had a thickpaste.We found it took a 24 lb. sack of flour for aboutthree and a half skins. We spread this paste over theflesh side of the skins with a brush and folded up the skins,and laid thom away in a dry place. We did not have enoughflour, vo we will have to work again to- morrow to finishtanning the skins we have ready for the tanning paste.
