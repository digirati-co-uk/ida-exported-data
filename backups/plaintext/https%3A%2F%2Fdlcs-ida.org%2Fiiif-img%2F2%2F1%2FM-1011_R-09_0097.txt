An examination of thecost of education in similar educational institutions, which areprivately endowed or supported by the state, will disclose thefact that in practically all such schools the per capita cost isnearly double what it is at Carlisle.Niy purpose in entering into this comparison and gatheringthese figures is to show that, as nearly as possible, for everydollar which comes from the public treasury of the United States,and is spent by the federal government toward the education ofIndians at the Carlisle school, the students produce nearly a
