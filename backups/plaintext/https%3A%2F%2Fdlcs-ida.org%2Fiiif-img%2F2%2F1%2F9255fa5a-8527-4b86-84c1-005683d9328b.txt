Department of the Interior,UNITED STATES INDIAN INSPECTION SERVICE,- 6-189....being offered an opportunity for defense, and transferred to the SantaFe school, at a reduced salary. waiving the question as to the causesof her transfer, in consideration of her valuable services in the pastand her qualifications as a teacher, she should be rewarded by a botter position and an increase in salary.The last Rules and Regulations governing Indian schools provides the" ration", quantity, etc., of said ration. The allowance ispremised by a statement that school farms" should" furnish abundanceof butter, milk, eggs, curas, cottage cheese, vegetables, etc. In thecase of the Santa Fe School, butter, eges, cottage cheese, curds, etc.are unknown quantities and, unless provision is made for more water,are likely to remain unknown. The consequence is that the regular ration amounts to 11 oz. per meal and is about all they receive. Therevised ration, I presume, has been well considered by the Indianoffice, but the reduction made may be sufficient for schools thathave an abundance of the articles above enumerated, appetizing products, but is not sufficient where these are lacking. The ration oflard is very small by weight, but much smaller in appearance, andshould be at least twice the amount allowed. It is a very useful article in bread, pies, etc., and for culinary purposes generally.huhhulkakufan- 14( kart( en indultRespectfully submitted,uutnliA. A.U. S.
