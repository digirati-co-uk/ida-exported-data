In the vocationalgrades, because of lack of equipment and owing to the factthat the 9th and 10th grades had been following the courseof study prescribed for the city high school, preparatory toentering that school, it was thought advisable to make nochange in the middle of the year.Weekly outlines have been prepared by the teachers showing the text and topic of work to be given each day in eachsubject and grade and the method pursued. These were handedto the Principal on Monday of each week.The school rooms are very well equipped, excepting, thatin some of the rooms old double desks are in use, it is proposed to replace these with the adjustable single desk. Theschool should be equipped with laboratory apparatus for teaching properly the chemistry, physics, etc., required by thenew course.rereThe textsin geography, reading and physiology have beenfound particularly good.
