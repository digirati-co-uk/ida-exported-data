School Philosophy:
My school is special to
me because it is part of my
Indian community. My school
is a place where my friends,
relatives and other people come
together for a short time to learn
from one another. It is a place
where my people' s
values are as precious as rain
on a dry day, a place where ideas are
nurtured as we do the corn in the
fields. Here, I learn about
the needs and desires of my
people and my community.
I learn how I can help them
through remaining and
participating with those I love.
We must come together as one
voice, one heart, and one mission
to strengthen and foster
Indian way of life.

The basic skills of reading,
writing and arithmetic I
learn not as tricks, but as
means to help me reach an
understanding of all man' s
commonality through
appreciation of shared books,
music, and customs. From
the way I am taught and
treated, I learn to respect
others, to have pride in
myself, to be always
socially, spiritually, and
physically strong, and to
have the confidence and
inner strength to become
a leader in my path I walk
because I am mentally
prepared. As a young
person, this is my time to
explore, to walk new paths,
to seek new experiences and
career oportunities...( p. 34)
