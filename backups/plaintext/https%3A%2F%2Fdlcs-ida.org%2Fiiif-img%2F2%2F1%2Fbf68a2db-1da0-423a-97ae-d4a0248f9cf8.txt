Navajo Agency.

before the employees and their families can have comfortable quar

There should be built at

I carefully examined the character and fitness of each
person employed at this agency, my opinion of them, their names, the
position they occupy, and the salary each receives is as follows:

ommended by Senator Allison of Iowa and others. He is not related
to any employe or Indian trader. Mr. Hayzlette is a good agent, and
an honest man.
Financial clerk.
Samuel E. Day; Arizona; age 55; male financial clerk; sal
ary$ 1200.00 per year; he has charge of the books and accounts of
the agency taking all his time; character; education; personal hab

is not related to the agent, or any employe; he is the father of
Charles L. Day, Indian trader at Chin Lee, Charles L. Day had a license

appointed financial clerk, I do not think because Mr. Day was appion
ted financial clerk, and father of Charles L. Day, it should reflect,
or in any manner reflect upon the younger Day, or in any way inter
fere with his receiveig a license to trade with the Indians of this
