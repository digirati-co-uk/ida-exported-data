Section II-INDUSTRIES.1.Thirty Indian Chapter organizations, which take in every sectionof the jurisdiction, have been formod, and through those organizations a definite program of advancement in all lines of activity is beingcarried out. The educational work actually being accomplished by means ofthese Chapters is far reaching and is of equal importance in pranoting theinterests of the Navajos as the schools themselves. In order to advance anyprogram among those people it is, of course, necessary that a means of contactbe afforded. Through those organizations we are able to koop almost constantly in contact with the Navajos of the entire jurisdiction. It is a partof our program to encourage the Indians to build a meeting house for theirorganization, and a communi ty Laundry and bath house at each of the thirtycenters. At this time we have completed six community houses, two communitylaundry and bath houses, and eight more are under way. In the constructionof these buildings, the Navajos contribute in labor about four- fifths of thecosts. The remaining part, which includes materials for roofs, floors, doors,and windows, is furnished by the Government. If the Government can continueto offer some assistance in this manner I am of the opinion that each of ourorganizations will have a mee ting house and laundry and bath house within thenext two years, and probably before that time.These meeting houses are of tremendous importance in stabilizingthe organizations, and in promoting the varied interests of the Nsva jo people,Definite objectives of our reservation program include the following:( a)Improving livestock by getting better sires.( b)Decreasing the size of the herds through intelligent culling.@Development of more efficient plans in flock management.( a)Reduction of goat herds to the minimum.( e) Development of water and proper distribution so that rangecan be used most economically.( 1) Increased agricultural activity through development andextension of irrigation projects.( 8) Improved irrigation and dry farming methods, which includefall plowing, planting good seed, and growing a grea ter variety ofcrops required for stock and for family consumption.Experimental practice under the direction of our ExtensionService to determine the most favorable crops for this country.A more definite program of control with reference to rodentsand insects is also being carried out.( h) Home improvement, including constructing houses, providingroot cellars, planting fruit and shade trees, developing domesticwater supply, and providing home gardens.We are at this time working on a five- year program for our
