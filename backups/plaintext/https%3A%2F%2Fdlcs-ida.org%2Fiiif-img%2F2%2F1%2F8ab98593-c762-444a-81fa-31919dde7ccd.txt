Sir:
Replying
to your
letter
of December
20th, I have
the honor
to transmit
herewith
a letter
from
Gov.
Prince
and other
prominent
citizens
of Santa
Fe regarding
appropriations
for the school
for
the
ensuing
year
,
The amount
asked
for is the same
as that menc
tioned
in letter
of December
13th, except
that
the salary
of Sae
perintendent
is included
in this
which
was unintentionally
omitted
from
the former
estimate
.
I also send
copies
of the letter from
the citizens
to Hou,#. 1, Dawes
, Mon, B, W. perking
, and the Hon.
Secretary
of the Interior
.
I confidently
believe
that the number
of pupils
in attend
ance at this
school
can se increased
to 250.
While
I have
met
uith
some opposition
in securing
shil√ºren
in some of the Pueblo
,
napon the whole
I consider
the outlook
favorable
.
I have been
reliably
informed
that a large percentage
of the pupils
in attend
ance
at St. Catherine's
school
desired
to come to this school
, and
would
have
done so had the school
been opened
at the beginning
of
the
year
.
There is a prospect
that we will very soon receive
,
