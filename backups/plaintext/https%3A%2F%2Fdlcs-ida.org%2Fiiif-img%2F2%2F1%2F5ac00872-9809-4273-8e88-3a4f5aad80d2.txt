( 3)These pums are in use in Colorado and in thisTerritory, but I am not familiar enough with themto indorse any one. The power to elevate thewater from the well to the surface can be suppli.ad by the engine to be used in the laundry.The well worl be sunk and stone hauled from themountains by the boys, but the wall would have tobe built by mechanics, The actual cost of thewell would be fio m$ 300 to$ 400.The school has been located here at aheavy expense and a considerable Additionalex} ense must be incurred to put the Brpund incondition to properly educate the children.I believe in practical education, and a knowledgeof the elementary branches an: a practi oalapplication of the principles of agriculture tothe soil of this Territory will do more towardsciviliging the Indians and making thm selssupporting than two years spent in the besttraining school in the bountry where theory, andnot practice is taught.To this end I recomm nd the expense abovereferred to, without desiring to guarantee thesatisfactory working power of the pump but Iwould demand a guarantee of the practical workingpower of the pump.
