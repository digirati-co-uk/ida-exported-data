If there ever WIs a suc* ee.ment, as is hintedin variouscom mmunicationsfound in IndianOfficearchives relatingto the subject, it undoubtedlyfailedto designatethe size of theditch through whichrateshouldbe taken to the Guachupanguearea.This Board is of the opinion, afterduly consideringtheavailable information, that the non- Indians are entitled46only to as muchwater as can be taken througha ditchof approximatelythe presentsize during twodays outof the week, and that whether the Indiansinrecent yearshave used the water ontheir days or not, they are entitledtothe uso of al of the water in the SantaClara Creek for fivedays out of eachweek, underconditionsas they exist atpresentThe ditch and intakeon the south side of the Santa ClaraCreekhas been responsiblefor the expenditureof considerable money at various timesin the last fifteen years. Whenin condition,it did irrigate anumber ofsmall tracts west ofthe railroadin the northeast corner of Section 16, and alarge area east of the railroad and southof Santa ClaraPueblovillage. Due to the neglectof the Indians, the ditchhas been in disrepair and in useonly intermittentlyin thelast ten years. It does seem to this Board that if a drag linewere to be used, a great deal of overnightstoragecould beobtainedwhich would be of inestimablevalue to the Indiansduringtheir irrigating season. There is a considerableareaon the north side of the creek in Irlian ownership,a thesouthernpart of Sections9 and 10, and the north corneofSection15, whichmight be irrigatedout ope.. Guachipangueditch, or perhaps from a new ditchtaken from the creek.If
