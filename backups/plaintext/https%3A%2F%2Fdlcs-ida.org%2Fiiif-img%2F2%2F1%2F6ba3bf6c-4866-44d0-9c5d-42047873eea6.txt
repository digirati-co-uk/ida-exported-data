Section III--- SCHOOLS( Cont'd)15.The expenditures for 1925 were$ 67,651.29.Theexpendituresfor 1926 were$ 83, 434.69( Exp. 4th Qr. est.).The increase in expenditures$ 15,783.40 may be accountedfor as follows:Salary paid Governor HagermanCost of Tesuque Day SchoolFurnitureand equipmentRepairs for nurses quarters, TaosSalary domestic science teacherSalary teacher, half year$ 6000.006500.001600.00400.00900.00600.00It will therefore be seen that while our expenses for 1926exceed those of 1925 some$ 15,783.40, same is accounted for.I might also add that a great deal more has been accomplished at Taos since the establishment of a domestic sciencedepartment and the employment of a full- time teacher.16.Fairly good use is being made of playground apparatus.( a) Do not think that there is very close supervision of children.( 6)Girls have the same privileges as the boys.17. I have no well set opinion as to how long it will benecessary to conduct the Government schools in this jurisdiction, To my knowledge there have been schools amongthe Pueblos for fifty years or more, and I do not believethat the end will be reached during the next fifty years,Schools must be maintained for a long time for these Indians:they apparently will be the last Indians to adopt fullcitizenship. There is such a wide influence being exercisedto keep these Indians Indians, to encourage them in theirancient customs, dances, and religion, and it will be severalgenerations hence before they will, if ever, be amalgamatedwith the citizens of the State.OlonensadeSuperintendent.
