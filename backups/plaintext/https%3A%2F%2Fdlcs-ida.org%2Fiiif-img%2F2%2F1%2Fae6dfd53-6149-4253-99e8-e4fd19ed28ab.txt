41-1" X 349 This building is now being
constructed. The foundation has been
completed and is first class in every particular.
* b* cost of this building complete will be$ 9,749.00.
The capacidy or the building will be but 150, while txt appropria
eion, and the capacity of the school will be 250.
hit will necessitate using the rooms in the main school building
for class rooms, whon it was the original idea to convert them into
dormitories. A good large addition to this building, with steam beating
apparatus is an absolute necessity. It was the intention of the Depan
ment to have a school building erected here with a capacity for 250,
and plans and spooifications were sont to rat with instructions to
Invite Informal bids for the eroction of the same. It was found
hovever that a building as desired could not be opoeted here for loss
than fifteen or sixtoon thousand dollars, and as the mendunt appropria
ted for school building was but$ 10,000.00 18 was necessary to hav.
the one now being constructed or none at all. It can be plainly soon
that an addition to this building is greatly needed, and I urgently
recommend that an appropriation or$ 12,000.00 be made for this purpose
and that room be made for 300 pupils.

bo The Water System is fairly good, but noads oxt onsion. A poor
quality of ungalvanized pipes were used in putting in this

should be taken up and replacedwith now galvanized iron pipes.
The heating system is by wood and coal stoves and is as good as
can be had by this system,
