# 2 Law and OrderThe Indians of this jurisdiction are practically all Catholicsand have a Catholic Mission Church in all of their pueblos. However,the Presbyterian Church maintains Missions at Jemez and Laguna. Thevillages of Seama and Casa Blanca have quite a few Protestant Indiansin them.The liquor traffic is increasing among these Indians due tothe fact that our personnel has been limited and also that of the Prohibition force. The Courts apparently are not in sympathy with thislaw and it is necessary for us to secure such evidence that the offendergenerally is forced to plead guilty before we can secure a conviction,and then the maximum sentence is generally sixty days with$ 100 fine,which has little effect on the Mexicans who are doing the bootleggingon the reservations. We believe the only successful way to combat thisevil is for us to have permission to pay appointed Indians as liquorofficers irregularly throughout the year for the purpose of securingthe evidence that the Courts require,- namely, the purchase by two ormore Indians of liquor on the reservation. We can then secure the necessary evidence and request the Prohibition office to make the arrests andprosecute the case. It is useless to send here any white special liquorofficers for the reason that the only evidence the Court seems to bewilling to take is the purchase by Indians.The Indians of this jurisdiction do not make any intoxicatingliquor, but in recent years have taken to selling same under the direction of Mexican bootleggers.The Indians of this jurisdiction do not use Peyote, Mesoal,extracts or proprietary medicines for beverage purposes.We believe there is sufficient legislation, both State andFederal, to adequately control the liquor traffic, but it is absolutelynecessary that we have more personnel to use in connection with this workif any headway is to be made at all. There have been no decisions by theState or Federal Courts during the past year effecting these Indians.cum o JorviibLem A. Towers,Superintendent.LAT: AD
