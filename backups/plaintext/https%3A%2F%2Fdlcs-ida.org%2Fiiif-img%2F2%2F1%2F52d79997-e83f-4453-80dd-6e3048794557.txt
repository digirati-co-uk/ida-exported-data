0-9EDUCATION- INDIANSThere was, six years ago, a two hundred pupil boarding schoolmaintained at this agency; since that time it has been abandonedbecause of damage to walls. This school should be opened for apart of six hundred Navajo children running wild upon this reservation.At my request a Supervisor of Construction was sent here toins cect and report upon these buildings, but I am not informedwhether he made any estimate of the cost of repairs. IncidentlyI heard from him that it would probably cost sixty thousanddollars.I was assured by members of the Committee of Indian Affairsthat the matter of appropriating necessary funds for the reopening of this school would receive their special and favorableconsideration,There are five day schools on this reservation, in which fivehundred pupils attended school during the past year. All arein need of repairs and new buildings.The school work has been badly crippled because of shortageof competent teachers. The highest basic salary paid teachersis$ 720.00 per annum; the same teacher is paid in the publicschools of the country from$ 1,380.00 to$ 1,800.00, and arenot subjected to the hardships and privations of reservationlife.It is hoped that the women voters of this country will show amore commendable appreciation of the work of the noble womenwho are devoting their lives to the uplift of the Indians thantheir brother voters have shown.The following transfers of children from this reservation tonon- reservation schools have been affected during the fiscalyear:Navajos26Hopis58Before September fisst not less than two hundred will have beentransferred, and it is the intention of the Superintend ent tocontinue send ing Navajo children away as long as outside schoolscan take them.
