- Stu Cliques ife-Not to ClickThere are many cliques around campus.There are the girls that like to dress to impress and others who are athletes. The females talk about the craziest things you canimagine, about guys, sports, vacations,things they did over the weekend and subjects too wild to mention.There are also the boy cliques who like todress up as gansters. The boys too talkabout crazy times, wild weekends and ofcourse, girls. Boys who give each other advice are usually the ones who seem tochange girlfriends every month. Boys alsogive each others support just like girls.Some people may think they are weirdcause guys are not suppose to be like that,however, some boys have sensitive feelingsjust like girls. Boys and girls will always bedifferent from one another no matter whatminute, hour, day, month, year, decade, orcentury, therefore, boys and girls may ormay not" click."â€” Sheldon CrespinMatt, Brendan, Ralph, and MarloEydie and Shana33
