ANNUAL REPORT, 1932--- ZUNI AGENCY, N. MEX.
NARRATIVE
Introduction
The Zuni Agency was organized as an agency some time in the ear
ly Eighties and was placed under the Southern Pueblos jurisdic
tion, with headquarters at Albuquerque. After a few years as
a sub- station, under a farmer by the name of Graham it was made
an agency and Mr. Graham was appointed as superintendent.
At this time the only school at this jurisdiction was a mission
school, with one teacher, at the present site of the Zuni Day

About 1897 or 1898 the Christian Reformed Mission started a
school at the present site of their mission buildings, after
the Presbyterian society had abandoned the work a few years be

The Day School was established about 1904 and additions thereto
have been made from time to time until it is one of the best

In 1924 the Catholic church established the St. Anthony' s Mis
sion at Zuni and in 1928 the boarding school at the agency was
converted into a sanatorium for under- developed and under- nour

in active operation since that time.
In the fall of 1931, because of the many demands of adult Indi
ans for hospitalization, and with no facilities for such upon
the reservation, the school hospital was converted into a hos
pi tal for adults, and has been used for both adults and minors
since that time.
The Zuni Reservation, which consists of approximately 333, 000
acres of land, has the Zuni River, with its tributaries the Nu
tria and the Pescado, flowing through the center of the reserva
tion with a wide valley along this river and its branches. A
few miles from these streams, upon each si de, the land becomes
broken with mesas in both directions- the rivers flowing from
the east to the west borders of the reservation. It is an ideal
