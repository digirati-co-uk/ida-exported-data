Annual Report, 1926.San Tuan Agency.Prior to 1923 the only water available, from December to March inclusive, was pumped from a surface well.This well is still in use. Prior to the fall of 1925 itdeveloped water in quantities sufficient for the needsof the school. However, nothingcould be said in favorof its quelity except that it was wet. It was not fitfor human consumption, the clothing came from the laundryto all appearances more dingy and less fit for use thanit was when taken to the laundry; beams and articles ofthat nature could not be cooked therein; when used inthe greenhouse, it killed all vegetation with which itcaine in contact. It was so full of salt and other mineralthat all faucets, bibs, and other valves developed leakswithin a Tew days of installation and required almostdaily repair. Water pipe had a life of only a few years;pressure water heaters were eaten through front the insidein even less time; steam boilers failed to resist itscorrosive qualities and were continually needing repair.It was wet and would extinguish fire if available insufficient quentities,which it seldom was. Beyond thisit possessed no commendable qualitiesIn 1925 a drilled well was completed that developeda very limited quantity of water heavily impregnated withsulfur. In the late fall of the same year a concretereservoir was constructed in close proximity to this wellinto which the well was caused to discharge. This reservoirwas connected with the stean pump and iron it the accumulated water was pumped to the service reservoir on thehill above the school. The production of this well provedso inconsequentialthat the plan was abandoned after thewinter of 1925- 24 and this rell was directly connectedwith the laundry, since which time the only water used inthe laundryhas been that produced by this well, a planthat has proven entirely satisfactory so far as the laundry is concerned.As has been stated above, prior to 1923 the only wateravailable during the winter months came from this surfacewo11 which we have described. During the remainder of theyear water was secured from the Hogback irrigation canalby gravity, this water passing airoctly from the canalinto the pipes, without settling, without filtration, andwithout chemical treatment. At all tines it carried insuspension a tremendous amount of silt and sand and at notime was there any assurance that it was biologically fitfor human consumption.
