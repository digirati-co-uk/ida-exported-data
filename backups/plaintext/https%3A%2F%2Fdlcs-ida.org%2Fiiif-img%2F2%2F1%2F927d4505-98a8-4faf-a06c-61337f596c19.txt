Sir:
We are returning herewith tho statistical sheets of our annual
roport, 1927, which were sent us for correotion,
Referring to page 16, we found an error in reporting the grazing
and mining leases and this has been correotod. The item covering
livestook, poultry, eto, was erroneously reported for the reason
that one of the farmers neglected to report the sheep owned on the
reservation. The item of salaries and wages was not correotly re
portod for the reason that the complete report from the Indian em
ployees of the Santa Fe Railroad at Winslor was not received at the
time this report was made up.
Referring to page 15, we find that$ 10, 125 was reported as tribal
livestook. This was in orror as there is no community livestock owned
by any of those Indians, The itom of$ 125, 000, valuo of community
timbor, has been explained in the forrestry sootion of our annual
report, We do not understand how tho itom of$ 800. 00 was submittod
last yoar as the value of timbor, and this must have been a typograph
ioal error,
Rospootfully yours,
int Jowero
