35- Hopi" In conclusion I wish to say that the medical staff ofthe agency seem anxious to do all within their power to help theIndian along medical lines and to do such work as will make themwant our services. I believe that the year 1932 will show betterresults as a result of the spirit manifested."If the Office approves we will have a small hospitalunit at Hotevilla, moving physician now at Oraibi to that point,in an endeavor to reach out into a nearby Navajo district and makethe services of both field physician and nurses of that districtof more value to the Service and to the Indians.The places of field matrons now at Hotevilla and Polaccawill probably be filled the coming fiscal year with nurses and thatwill be an added feature for better health work and in carrying outthe Health Programs as planned by our head physician.Just now we are badly handicapped for want of an X- rayoutfit and hope the office may give us funds for such equipment thisfiscal year.Field nurses are badly needed among the Navajos. Justnow there is none. We were told we were to get one( for the PinonDistrict) this year. If we do, we will carry out a very desirablework in that country this year. It is too far now from the hospitalfor best medical attention.Our Health Personnel, with one or two contemplatedreplacements, will be very satisfactory for our planned increase inefficiency and territory.E.
