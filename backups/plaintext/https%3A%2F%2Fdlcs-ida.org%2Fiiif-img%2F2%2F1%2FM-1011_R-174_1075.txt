The construction of this road would doubtless bring
a greatly increased number of tourists into the Zuni
village which would undoubtedly benefit the Indians
by greatly increasing the sale of Indian silverware,
pottery and other curios.
The second road construction work pending is a
road to the south and southeast part of the reser
vation which is badly needed for access to tnese
parts. To date no survey has been completed on either
of the above mentioned roads, and a careful analysis
of the cost cannot be made at this time. It is
estimated that each of the two roads will cost$ 10, 000.
