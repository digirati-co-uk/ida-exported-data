Reading
The group was divided into two classes.
The bright class read:
" The Bolenius Primer"," Elson Primer"" Bolenius Tirst Reader" and
" Bobbs Merrill First Reader".
The slow class read four Pre- Primers:
" The Bobbs llerrill Primer"," Every Day ClassicPrimer" and half of
The Bolenius Primer".
Besides the health charts many experience charts were composed
and read about things that happened in their every day life.
Activities
Knitting of sweaters was started after Christmas.
Everyone
learned to knit well and several sweaters were finished.
The class
made wooden needles at first but since they broke so often they
made needles out of wire.
At laster time baskets were woven out of the natural yucca which
we gathered in this vicinity.
Nature study ws correlated with the regular class room procoedure.
The value and harm of small croatur s were learned. Excursions were
taken to learn the names of plants, trees and habitat of animals in
this vicinity.
Altogether I felt my seven months teaching was very successful.
