HOPI INDIAN AGENCY
ANNUAL REPORT
NARRATIVE SECTION
Seotion VI.....
Sales
None of these Indians have received any patents in fee,
certificates of competency, or removal of restrictions.
None of these lands have been patented or sola.
Since I have been here patent has been given to one
mission.
No sales of inherited or surplus lands have been made
at this Agenoy.
Determination of heirs of deceased Indians in a legal
and lawful way has never yet been attempted on this reserva
tion. The matter has been left to the judgment of the rela.
tives of the Indians. I do not believe the time is ripe for
probating the affairs of these Indians& ccording to law,
This should be done only after we have proper laws governing
these Indians.
We have but very little individual Indian monies, and
hardly any of that 18 draw out during the fisoal year. It
is mostly mining money.
