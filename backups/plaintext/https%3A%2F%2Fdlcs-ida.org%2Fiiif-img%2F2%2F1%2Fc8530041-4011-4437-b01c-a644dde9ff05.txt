Sir:
We are returning herewith your copy of the Santo Domingo
1935 Census with the number of males and females noted at the bottom
of each page, as requested in your letter of recent date.
We are not making up the Annual Report pages for this
Pueblo as the census was taken new this year and it is impossible
to check it with the old census as this was merely copied for a num
ber of years, we being unable to secure any information as to births
and deaths in this village. There are nany names appearing on this
census who are full blood Domingos that did not appear on the old
1934 census. In some cases these are names which had been left off,
in other cases persons who had changed their names so any figures we
would give would be inaccurate.
The 1935 Census shows births as follows:
25 males, 13
females.
Respectfully yours,
Ac
Lem A. Towers,
Assistant Superintendent.
