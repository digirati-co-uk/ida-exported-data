The returned students do the same class of work as the other Indians
in reservation work, but as stated before, the majority of the returned
students secure work off the reservation in railroad work, road work,
at sawmills, etc.
The farmers and stockman spend their entire time on the reservation,
inspecting sheep, dipping sheep, instructing the Indians in stock raising
and farming. One farmer is stationed at Cornfields, 40 miles southwest of
the agency; one at Chin Lee, 50 miles west of the agency: one stoclonan and
one farmer at the agency. One farmer is suppáted with an old Ford automobile,
which is constantly having to be repaired; the others with horses and wagons.
I have requested the purchase of three new automobiles for their use.

We now have farm organizations in the Ganado district, and are forming
others in different parts of the reservat ion. These organizations are doing
good work; the Indians are interested and are planning their work in advance
from year to year.
The Indians do not have any difficulty in marketing their surplus farm
produce. The Indian traders wi 11 buy all they cansell, and would buy more,
giving them a fair price for their produce. At the present time traders
in the Lukaciukai district are paying$ 20.00 per ton for baled alfalfa hay,
which is a very good price.
We have one sawmill located 12 miles west of the agency, which puts out
about 250,000 feet of lumber a year. Owing to the fact that the entire mill
and about 200,000 feet of lumber burned in the spring of1924, we have not yet
gotten ahead in lumber, using all they can saw, and as fast šs they can get it
out.
The Navajo Reservation is covered with ruins and clipe dwellings, which
are now proteeted from spoilation of every tourist that comes to the reservation.
