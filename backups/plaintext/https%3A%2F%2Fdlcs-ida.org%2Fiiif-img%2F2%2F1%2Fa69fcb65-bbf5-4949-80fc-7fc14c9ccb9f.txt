( c) No provision is made by the Indians for fooding stockduring the winter, except in sono areas the alfalfa produced is used tosomo oxtont. Ordinarily this crop is sold to traders who, in turn,soll back to the Navajos during the year. However, this feod is la rgelyused for horsos.We have boon putting forth much offort since the organizationof our Chapters in persuading the Indians to plant supplemental feed ofvari ous cane varieties for thoir shoop. Such action on their part wouldenable them to carry thoir shoop through the winter with much less loss,and would, at the same time, be a contributory factor towards solving thegreat problem of range conservation, As a result of our discussions alongthese lines, many requests have been roceived for sudan grass seed andvarious other for√•ge sood. We feel that there is a great opportunity toaccomplish worthwhile results by promoting this idea.( a) The outlook for future of stock raising among the Nava josis not good unless definite and immediate action is taken in effecting arange conservation program. A recent reconnaissance of the range by theForestry division of our office indicates that the range is now supportingfive times the stock which it should support if proper consideration isgiven towards its conservation. A solution to this problem seems to demandthe following action:1.A proper distribution of water to accommodate the entire range.2.Reduction of number of sheep and improvement of quality. Areduction of goats to the minimm.3.Rodent control.Development of farming activities, and thus divert the industryof many of the Indians and, at the same time, supply supplementalfeed for livestock.5.An educational policy with reference to our high schools, wherebyNavajo you ths will be trained for making a livelihood off thereservation rather than on it and be taught the necessity ofsuch policy, not only with reference to their own interests, butalso with reference to the interests of thos Navajos who mustlive on the reservation because of lack of opportunity to acquirean education that would fit them for work elsewhere.( e) There are no white stockmen on the reservation.( f) Every acre of available range lands is now used by the Indi ans.( 8) A greater number of high grade si res is required to improvethe grade of livestock belonging to the Indians. This particularly appliesto rams, stallions, and jacks.( h) This jurisdiction does not support a tribal herd.- 14
