also as an interpretation of that doeOription. It is alsorelevant as a link between the confirmation by Congress andthe Harvey and map. The two latter are the areat reultsof the decision, lacking which they could never have been made,because the General Land Ofoe had in effoot rejected thegrant, as the Seoretary' s deoision itself shows.Still nurther1t shows that the names Martinez" and" Martin"are used inter.changeably( as a lso does the original Spani ah grant),and istherefore relevant to plaintiff' s case under the next head,where title will be made out under the Antonio Martines,OrMartin, grant also. There can be no question as to the relovancy of this paperWritten objection is also made to the Joab Houghton aeedof 1861( P1ffs, Tx. 18) for several reasons.The objeotionthat it is not a deed but merely a son traot for a dead hasbeen shown to be incorrest in fact. The only other objectionworth sorts1 dering is that no power of attorney to Joab Houghtonhas been proved, nor are the names of the heirs of the original grantees given. The dead, however, states on its fansthat it is given by" Jose Rafael Vigil, Juan Vigil, and others,including all the heirs of Pedro Visal as Santillana, JuanBautista Vigil and Cristobal Vigilaееeaned, representedby Joab Houghton as their agent and attorney." Houghton alsoBeknowledges the deed" as roprocentative of an ad hen."How this deed is an ancient document and the Sapreme Courtin a series of decisions has a reoty ruled on this aort ofobootion, holding not only that in the case of an anodontdocument the authority of an attorney in faot with 1l be proamed,but also that recitals exactly similar to the above recitalthat the dead as mad by all the heirs, are prima facio proofof the facts reopted.11
