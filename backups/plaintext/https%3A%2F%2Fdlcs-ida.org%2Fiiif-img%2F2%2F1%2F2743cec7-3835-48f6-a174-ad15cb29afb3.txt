Health.
( Written by Dr. Paul G. Ellers.)
General health conditions of the Pueblos during the past year
have been very good. No epidemics of any kind have occurred excepting
chicken pox in the Pueblo of San Felipe and in this no serious condi.
tions developed and no fatalities.
One of the greatest hindrances to health work in some of the
pueblos( and this is true to an extent in all) comes from the ruling
power of the pueblos which is vested in the cacique and his principales.
It appears to be the avowed purpose of these rulers to suppress progress
in ideas, this being especially true of treatment and prevention of
disease which to them is largely a proposition of pagan rites and core
monials. The educated Indian who has learned the better ways of life
and wishes to follow them is prevented from doing so by fear of punish
ment. If this influence is not made openly it is secretly married out.
This is an explanation of many instances in which neglect in treatment
and care of Indians has been complained of, especially by certain
propogandists, Many instances occur where certain suggestions are not
carried out and medical treatment refused simply for the reason given
above.
One of the greatest factors in the improvement of health condi
tions as well as other lines would be the abolishment of the cacique
rule and the election under government supervision of pueblo officials
by the vote of the people.
General sanitary conditions on the reservation and in and around
Indian homes are fairly good as sanitary inspections are regularly made
