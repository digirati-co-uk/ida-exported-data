- 5-With the successful completion of proposedinclusion of the Miller Division of the Cibola NationalForest and the Santa Fe railroad lands lying withinthe reservation there would be acquired sufficienttimber to meet the local needs of the reservationand tne Zuni Indians for many years.The timber of merchantable size on the reservationhas no commercial value other than for local use.The character of the timber stands, lying in isolatedgroups, the poor quality of the timber itself dueto poor site quality, and the distance from marketcombine to prevent the Zuni Reservation timber fromnaving any sale value. Pinon pine mine timbers andjuniper rence posts can not be profitably cut andtransported to Gallup under present business conditionsand with road conditions far too poor to justifyhauling timber products.Future ManagementThe Zuni Indians depend largely upon the production of sheep and wool for their livelihood. Thereare now upon the reservation approximately 30, 000sheep and goats with accessible range of only 233, 444acres, or 7. 78 acres per head for year- long grazing.In addition there are approximately 200 head ofrange cattle and approximately 500 worthless wildhorses using the range.
