With the successful completion of proposed
inclusion of the Miller Division of the Cibola National
Forest and the Santa Fe railroad lands lying within
the reservation there would be acquired sufficient
timber to meet the local needs of the reservation
and tne Zuni Indians for many years.
The timber of merchantable size on the reservation
has no commercial value other than for local use.
The character of the timber stands, lying in isolated
groups, the poor quality of the timber itself due
to poor site quality, and the distance from market
combine to prevent the Zuni Reservation timber from
naving any sale value. Pinon pine mine timbers and
juniper rence posts can not be profitably cut and
transported to Gallup under present business conditions
and with road conditions far too poor to justify
hauling timber products.
Future Management
The Zuni Indians depend largely upon the pro
duction of sheep and wool for their livelihood. There
are now upon the reservation approximately 30, 000
sheep and goats with accessible range of only 233, 444
acres, or 7. 78 acres per head for year- long grazing.
In addition there are approximately 200 head of
range cattle and approximately 500 worthless wild
horses using the range.
