SCHOOLS,
SECTION III-
Relations, in general, between public schools and
Indian schools are good.
There are but one small public school anywhere near
the Indian country. It is located at the Zuni pueblo but
it is too small to accomodate any Indian children.
3.( a)
The Boarding school plant is need of a building
for classroom and assembly purposes, Ptshould contain
four classrooms, an assembly room and if possible a
gymnasium. The school also is in need of cottages
for the carpenter, disciplinarian, principal, engi
ne er and superintendent.
( b)
The school farm is well equipped. We should have
a small dairy herd but before it is provided a build
ing should be provided in which to house the cows.
( e) As concerns employees, the needs of the school
- are provided.
( a) The day school is now erecting a lavatory build
ing. This will provide adeguate toilet and bathing
facilities, needs that have long been felt. Upon
completion of this building the school will be well
equipped with buildings excepting an employees build
ing of sufficient capacity to properly house six
employees..
The character of the graduates is very good.
( b).
Their immediate outlook is very encouraging.
The Zuni children take home and use what they learn
in school. They are an energetic people. They are
not afraid of work. They are willing to apply pro
gressive ideas.
There are two Mission Day Schools on the reserva
tion. They are doing good work. One of the schools is
handicapped by lack of suitable school buildings but it
is appearent that they will be provided in the near
future.
The Indians of this jurisdiction have a viewpoint
of morale different from white people. However they
are not at ali bad compared with the average Indian of
the southwest.
