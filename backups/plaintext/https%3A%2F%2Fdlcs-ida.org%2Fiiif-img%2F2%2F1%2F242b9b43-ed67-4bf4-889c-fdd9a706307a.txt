Na rat ive.LeuppIndianSchool& AgencyLeupp, ArizonaSection VField Irrigation.There is no water for field irrigation on this jurisdiction.There was a project here at Leupp that contemplated the impoundingof the flow of Canyon Diablo, syphoning it under the River and using1t on irrigable lands on both sides of the river between here andTolchaco.This scheme was never developed.Now the whole area contemplated to be used is covered by aprojected storage dam for a power plant the first unit of whichwould use the drop at Grand Falls. Extensive surveys have beenmade and a record of the River flow is being kept.The plan is entirely feasible and the construction would notbe excessively costly.The storage of flood waters at different points might bepracticable but would have to be worked out by the IrrigationEngineers. I believe water could be stored in the Lakes basintwelve miles north of Leupp in sufficient quantity to use in developing a large farm across the river. A dyke about one- quarter tomile long would be necessary.
