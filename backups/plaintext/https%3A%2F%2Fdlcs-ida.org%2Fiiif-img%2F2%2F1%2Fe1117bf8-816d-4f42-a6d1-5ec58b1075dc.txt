DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIORUNITED STATES INDIAN SERVICELe upp, Arizona.July, 29- 1912.Mr. Charles. Dic kson,Supt. and Spl. Dist. Agent,Le upp, Arizona.De ar Sir.I res pectfully submit the following statement relative to the condition of the school farm as compared with thatof last year.Five acres of the east end has been plan te d to Melons andVe ga tables, and the north half of the remain ing 15 acres too ats, while the South half was so we d with black hulled whiteKafir corn.The melons and vegetabies failed to come up, with thea xception of a scatter ing plant here an d there; and the oatsand Kafir corn is a very poor s tan d, be ing uneven an d√° ightan d with an un he al thy color in general.The soil s ho We the effect of sol ids con ta ined in theirrigat ing water to a much gre a ter extent than it did last year,which proves conclusively that it can not be made to producea profitable crop. It is approximately 20 feet to the gro un dwater un de rly in the farm, and this water con ta ins the sameelements as that used in irrigating. The ground is heavilychar ged with al kali. also, and the capillary action which takesplace as the gro un d water rises to the surface, together with theeffect of evaporation is le av in g a heavy crust of sol ids onthe surface making it impossible to raise crops profitably.
