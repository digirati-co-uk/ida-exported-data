NARRATIVE
Section VI
Sa i es
Jicarilla
Agency
New Mexico
No patents in fee nor certificates
of competency
have been issued to members of the Jicarilla tribe.
This need not be taken as evidence that no members
are entitled to such consideration for a number of them
have cattle, sheep, and goats in numbers that insures
self support and independence in measure to compare
favorablg with other tribes and people.
The particular adaptation of the Jicarilla
reservation
to the sheep industry and the regulation
holding all timber as tribal property tends to preclude
sales of land to others than members of the ticarilla
Indians
.
This is fortunate and it is hoped that their
stock industry will so prosper that in time individual
menees can surely arrange to purchase all inherited
estates for the younger members of their respective
families thus saving the possibility
of having people
located on the reserve that in time could be a serious
handicap
to their chosen industry.
