Pueblo Indian Agonoy,
August 12, 1919.
LARRAIITE
Seotion 11...... Health
1-2 and 3. The dreadful epidemio of" Flu"
was
very severe among the Pueblos,
Their crowded condition
in the Pueblos facilitated its rapid spread and their
reluctance to obey the directions of the Physicians
made it difficult to combat the diseas.. By instruction
of the Offioo we are limited to" Persuasion No drastio
Measures" enforcing the Act of August 1, 1914, but I
notice that the health anthorities in dealing with Whites
do not porsuade they command and use drastic measures when
theyo
necessary Were it possible to enforce this act great
good could be accomplished.
When a case of tuberculosis is discovered by a
physician he tries to induce the patient to go to the
Laguna Sanatorium and the Superintendent and other
employees also endeavour to accomplish this object, but
the patient listens to the old Cacique and medicine men
and refuses and all the Government employees are powerless,
