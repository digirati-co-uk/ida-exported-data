It became necessary to convert the mending room ofthe sewing department into a dormitory in order to be able tocare for the large enrollment of girls.The plant consists of forty- two brick, frame and adobebuild ings and is in a fair state of repair. Eleven buildingsare heated by ind ividual hot water and steam plants. In otherbuildings stoves are used and they are unsatisfactory anddangerous in an institution caring for children.
