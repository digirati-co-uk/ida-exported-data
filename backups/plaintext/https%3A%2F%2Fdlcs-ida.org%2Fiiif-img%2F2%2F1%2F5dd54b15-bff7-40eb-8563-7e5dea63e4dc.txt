Dear Sir:
I answer to your letter of the IIth ultimo, I would intorn
you that the Indian Office has refused authority for me to purchase
the engine end boiler, owing chiefly to the fact that the consumption
of fuel would be too great, and that the imngdiate necessity of such
a large engine could not be seen by that Office,
I bellbye, however, that it would be to your advantage to commun
icate with I. Sparks, Santa Fe, n. M. He taight be able to make some
bargain with you, or find sale for boiler and engine,
Very truly yours.
Superinten tento
