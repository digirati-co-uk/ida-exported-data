The Santa Fe Indian School Community Comes
Together to Spruce up the Campus
..........
Early in the year, the SFIS
Community, from Board
Members to PAC Members to
Staff and to Students, gathered
on a Saturday morning to begin
cleaning our campus, which
many of our school leaders have
called" the 20th pueblo."
Community members raked,
lugged, and scrubbed in order
to make our campus shine.
The Community Day had help from all parts of the SFIS Community. Pictured here are PAC
members( L- R) Michael Lewis of Acoma, Loretta Kendy of Zuni, Melinda Yazzie of the Navajo
Nation, and Robert Garcia of San Felipe.
