23. Celebrations have been treated in previous
reports and recommendations made the Office for the
governing thereof, but as no attention bas over been paid
to reports on this aubject I deem it a waste of time to
repeat here what has been said repeatedly in previous
reports and letters to the Department and in Inspetor's
Reports.( Sea Seotion IV. Industries, pargraph 20,
Narrative Section of my Annual Report for 1915).
24. See above,
26. Employment is found for all young girls
who are able to work as domes tios by the Superintendent
and Agenoy employes. In fact, the demand for girls far
exoeeds the supply. Young men are employed in the rail
way shops at Albuquerque, Gallip and Winslow and they
render very satisfactory service,
No benefit is derived through Mr. Dagenett's
department by Indians of this jurisdiction,
