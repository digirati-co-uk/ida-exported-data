Instead of beginning to develop a sentence sense Ifeel that the children can be taught to speak in goodsentence form from the start. This would give them abetter start toward expressing, themselves more fluentlyin the English language when they have reached the higherlevels. Instead of having a checked vocabulary listwhich the children merely knew the meaning of the checkedvocabulary list would be a list of the words the childrenused in good English sentences and which they understoodas well.It would help a great deal if the teachers could go outand visit the Navajo homes so that they would have abetter understanding of the task ahead of them to betterfit the Nava jo boy and girl to live to a better advantagein their own enviornment.
