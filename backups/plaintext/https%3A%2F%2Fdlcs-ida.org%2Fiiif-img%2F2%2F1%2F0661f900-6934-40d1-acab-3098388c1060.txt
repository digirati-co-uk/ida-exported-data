Instead of beginning to develop a sentence sense I
feel that the children can be taught to speak in good
sentence form from the start. This would give them a
better start toward expressing, themselves more fluently
in the English language when they have reached the higher
levels. Instead of having a checked vocabulary list
which the children merely knew the meaning of the checked
vocabulary list would be a list of the words the children
used in good English sentences and which they understood
as well.
It would help a great deal if the teachers could go out
and visit the Navajo homes so that they would have a
better understanding of the task ahead of them to better
fit the Nava jo boy and girl to live to a better advantage
in their own enviornment.
