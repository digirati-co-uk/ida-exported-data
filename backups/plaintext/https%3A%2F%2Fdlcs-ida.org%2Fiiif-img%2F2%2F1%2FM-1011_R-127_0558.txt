Annual Report.Field- IrrigationSanta Fe Schooland Agency,this plant has come about through the lack of proper management rather than through lack of funds, as I am of the opinion a considerable amount of money has been 9pent in otherwork anong the pueblos, which, if necessary, could have beendiverted and used for the completion of this plant.I give this incident in the conduct of irrigationwork among the pueblos in this district because of its bearing on the recommendation which I would make, that, if prac.ticable, the funds apportioned for irrigation among the pueb.los in the Santa Fe district be placed at the disposal of thesuperintendent, and that he be authorized on receipt of properauthority from the olice to expend such apportionment in theemplayment of engineers. for short periods, such labor in theway of formon as may be necessary, and in the purchase ofmaterial for the carrying on of such irrigation work as thefunds would warrant.
