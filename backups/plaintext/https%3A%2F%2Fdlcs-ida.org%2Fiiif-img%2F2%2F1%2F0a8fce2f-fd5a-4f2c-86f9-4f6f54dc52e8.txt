We endeavor
to give vocational
courses
in carpentry
,
engineering
, blacksmithing
and agriculture
and the prevoca
tional
courses required
. A shop and equipment
for an auto
mechanics
department
have recently
been furnished
and this
department
will be in operation
for the ensuing
school year.
More than the prevocational
and less than a vocational
course
is given in shoe and harness making
and tailoring
.
The girls are given a course
in home economics
and all
of the prevocational
courses
required. Their training
in
nursing
is more than the prevocational
but less than the
vocational
course.
