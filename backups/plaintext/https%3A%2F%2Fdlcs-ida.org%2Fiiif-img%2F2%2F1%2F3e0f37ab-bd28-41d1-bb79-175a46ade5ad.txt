On the census
is the name of aged Indian who a few years
ago was fired by the same supertitoon
.
He had lost members
of his immediate
family and he saw some of his grandchildren
sicken and die.
There was a cause but his suspicious
mind
did not understand
and charging
the losses
to the witchery
of an infirm neighbor
woman a murder resulted
.
Now it must be understood
that the above are extreme
cases and have been given that the depth of their despondency
may be appreciated.
It gives me a pleasure
to say that I
believe
that there is a cresent
promise
for these people.
The illustrations
date back to live and six years ago in
their initiation
.
This period, it seems to me, marks their
low tide,
The inauguration
of new industrial
policies
,
purchase
of tribal stock, farm and garden equipment
, horses,
etc., as outlined by the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs seems
to have given them new hope.
Effective
prohibition
removes
their worst stumbling
block.
They are showing considerable
interest
in field and garden
activities
.
A number of them
have flocks of goats and sheep and a few have large flocks
numbering up to two thousand.
Some of them have cattle herds
ranging in numbers from a dozen to one and two hundred.
Total receipts for the fiscal year for their labor and for
the product of their labor reached$ 50,000.
