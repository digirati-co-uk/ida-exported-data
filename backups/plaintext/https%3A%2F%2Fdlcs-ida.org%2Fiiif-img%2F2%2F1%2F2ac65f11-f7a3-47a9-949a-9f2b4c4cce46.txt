FARMING
.
Practically, this work has been a failure, forant of water for irri
gation.
Some gardening has been attempted and a few vegetables have
buon raised, but not sufficient to pay for the labor bestowed upon it,
the only real benefit derived from it is the experience gained by the
boys who performed the work,
The work in this department has been carried on under the direction
of the Farner and Industrial Teacher, more has been accomplished in the
goneral work necessary about an institution of this kind than in attempt
ing to cultivate the soil.
