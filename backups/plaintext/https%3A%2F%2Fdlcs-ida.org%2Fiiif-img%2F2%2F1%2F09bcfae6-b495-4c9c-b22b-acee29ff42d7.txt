- Health
The general health condition have been good both at the
school and agency during the past year.
Fortunately the school has had no severe epidemics. There
have been a few cases of whooping cough and several cases of
influenza.
There was one case of smallpox among the reservation
Indians contracted from a white man in the employ of the Depart
ment of Agriculture.
He was promptly isolated and all the
Indians in the locality were vaccinated. The Indians seem to
more
take/ kindly to vaccination than the same number of white people.
Some Indians came a long distance asking to be vaccinated.
There were several cases of whooping cough with almost un
iformily fatal results among the reservation people. This was,
I think, largely due to exposure and misdirected attention.
There were several cases of German Measels.
Some of the
school children were quarantined because of coming in contact
with a case, but none of them contracted the disease.
A few cases of Mumps were reported at a distanco from the
agency, but not until they had recovered. They were not seen
by the physician and woro not recorded bocause of lack of de
finito data.
The traders at a distance report that during August and
September of each year a large number of casos of rapidly fatal
diarrhoon occur among childron in their second summer. This,
like similar ones in large cities is probably due to faulty
feeding and hygiene.
