Theterritory west of the Little Colorado River is the winterrange of a large portion of the stock of the citizens of this countywhich will be driven out of the county if the same is not protected forthem.2nd, The Little Colorado River is the only natural boundary line available and the only line that can be traced and marked with definitenesand accuracy to both the white settler and the Indian.3rd. It is only by having a definite natural boundary which can beuniversally understood, and thus keep the flocks and property interestsof the whites and Indians separated that the peace and safety of the settlers can be protected from the rashness of the ill advised and unscrupulous of both races upon the borders.4th, For further facts and details of existing conditions we refer tothe report of the committee of five citizens of this county, submittedto the Department, through Col.
