$ 207.00
I have the honor to state that during the fiscal year 1897, I was
granted authority to expend$ 120.00 for delicacies, but last year the
suptas
annount was cut down to$ 50.00, which is a very small amount ror this
purpose for a whole year.
with the attendance inoroased this year to 250, I consider$ 100.00
for delicacies for sick pupils a very conservative estimate, and I
respactfully ask your favorable consideration of the same.
