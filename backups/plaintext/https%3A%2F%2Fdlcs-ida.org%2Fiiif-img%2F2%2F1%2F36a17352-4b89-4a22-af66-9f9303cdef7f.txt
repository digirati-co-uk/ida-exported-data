33Indian education is entering a new era nurtured by the involvement of Indianprofessionals who are challenging the status quo in regard to the value of Nativeperception. The Native American perspective is an articulation of a long overduerecognition that Indian people are different from the mainstream. It is finally beingrecognized that Indian people have taught and have learned since the beginning of time.The survival of Native people' s language, culture and tradition can be attributedto the fact that Native education has always been a part of our existence and is thebasis of our survival as a unique population in the United States of America. The factthat there are Native teaching and learning styles is finally being recognized byacademia and is serving as the basis for valuing the participation and input of Indianpeople in addressing the needs from our" perspective. ” At long last “ our perspective ” isplaying a more significant role in defining strategies for teaching Indian students andsubsequently impacting the success of our children in profound ways.The challenge to us from our fathers and mothers to work hard in acquiringskills as a condition for impacting positively who we are as Indian people is taking on awhole new significance in regard to our place at the decision making level which hashistorically denied access to our perspective as Indian people. The challenge for Indianpeople and particularly our youth is to not only be proud of who we are, but to declarethat pride in an articulation of the fact that for Indian education to succeed, it needsIndian people to identify needs, to interpret solutions to problems and to implementprograms to address those problems.Sincerely,Chenti XVICASincerely.Quel chesteph Abeyta, Superintendent
