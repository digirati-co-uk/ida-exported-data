ALLOTMENTS.
The Reservation does not present any hope of successful
allotment of Indians, owing to the insufficient water supplies
and the curious combination of climate and soil. Twice the
Government has determined to allot these Ind lans, each time
without having intelligently considered the feasibility of the
project, and twice the matter has been abandoned after the
expenditure of considerable sums. Until the deserts of Arizona
teem with rivers and fish, it will not be possible to allot
these Indians with view to agriculture on such& scale as to
assure their independence. The outlook is a stook- raising one.
And until far greater water supplies have been developed, it will
not be possible to consider anything other than a common- ground
grazing area for all resident Indians.
SATES:
There can be no sales of land, since the Indians have
not been allotted, etc.
