-21They differ very little in the technique of thetreatment, and not at all in their view of themagnitude and imminence of the problem as a whole,The same may, as I am advised, be said of Dr.Vigglesworth, now stationed at Chinle.At all threeof the se places the Indians are now going in as fastas they can be attended to, and the doctors and theirassistants are doing valiant service in dealing withthe situation. Between two and three thousand Indianshave, I am informed, been examined, and several hundredcases have been treated by each unit; many surgicalcases otreated;..; and many others, requiring operations,have been and are being given the necessary treatment.The schools have, to all intents and purposes, beenturned into hospitals.The general result of this preliminary campaignand of the observation and experience of these menconfirms the opinion already held by them and otherscon versant with the situation, that from 25% to 30%of the Naya jos outside of the schools are now afflictedwith trachoma in a more or less advanced stage, andfrom 40% to 50% of the children in the schools havethe disease, and that the schools are spreading theinfection.

To do this will require a reorganization of the education program by Congress and a quiteradical re- apportionment and redistribution of fundsavailable for Nava jo activities on the reservation,This, of course, means a very definite campaign inCongress itself, to convince the appropriators ofpublic funds that fundamentally the health situationhas become the basic problem amongst these people andthat its successful solution is a pre- requisite to allother phases of the Nava jo problem,- industrial,educational and what not; for it is quite evident thatif the Nava jos are rapdaly drifting into a state ofuniversal infection by a virulent disease, industrialand educational activities can be of little availamongst them. Many of the schools are, to a greater
