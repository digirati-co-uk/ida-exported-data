Annual Report--
The school farm consists of only about 100 acres of irrigable
land, which is inadequate for keeping a herd of cows large enough
for a school of this size. Additional land should be purchased and
the herda increased from twenty to about 50 milk cows.
It is worthy of note that most of the graduates of this
school are doing well. A good number have gone to Haskell
Institute and he. ve graduated from there and in every case they are
succeeding. There are several teachers among the young women, a
nurÄ±ber of clerks among the young men and women, and others who
are apparently taking a success in life.
The total expenditures for all purposes. during the current
fiscal year were practically the same as for the preceding fiscal
year.
