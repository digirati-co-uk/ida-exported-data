to the two teachers whom I respectfully
recommend to
the new
positions allowed by your orrice, I take the liborty to say.

Wr.Moses
Shongo now of the Chemawa, Oregon school has a good reputation as
teacher and, as band- master
has won an enviable reputation
. Farther,
he has repeatedly expressed his desire to be sent to this school.
Mrs V. E. Dawes of the Cheyenne, Oklahoma school, whom I recommend for
the$ 540 position, is a lady of long and successful experienc. in the
Indian School Work. She was with me at the Cheyenne School for three
year3
and during that time she amply proved her ability to fill such
a position
as the one
so kindly allowed here.
She is a skilled amit
with pencil and brush, works admirably aalay modeling, ranoy noodle
work and the like, is well up in the theory of modern educational circlas
and, withal, she is a most remarkable success in fostering and main
taining
a true esprit- de- corps among the school employos. Indodd, a
* faction or aliokº
cannot well exist
in a school where she is
ployed.
