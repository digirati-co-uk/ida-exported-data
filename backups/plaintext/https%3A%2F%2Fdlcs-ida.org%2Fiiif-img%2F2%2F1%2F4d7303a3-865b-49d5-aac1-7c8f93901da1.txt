Chas. M. Haml in, of Brutus, Michigan, an Ottawa Indian boy who is greatly
He has written to me a numbor of
desirous of entering this school,
times, and would come of his own accord if he had sufficient funds.
The boy seems very' anxious to obtain an education, and does not
want to attend any other school, and agrees to remain here three years,
or until he graduates.
I am most anxious to obtain all the pupils
possible from a distance, as 75 per cent of the pupils here now are
Pueblos.
I nost respectfully request that I be allowed to pay the
transportation of this boy from Brutus, Mich., to Santa Fe, N.M., as I
have sufficient Transportation Funds on hand to guarantee the expense,
Very respectfully,
Superintendent,
