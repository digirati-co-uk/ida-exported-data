Hona Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
Washington, D.C.
Sir:
I have the honor to request authority to expend a sum not exceed
ing$ 6.00 for extracting, filing and clipping the teeth of three school
horses.
I have noticud for some time that something was the matter with
these horses as they seemed to have no appetite, and kupt getting poor.
Yesterday I had them examined by an expert, and he discovered that
their mouths were so sore they could not chew the food, and the only
remedy in such cases is to temove the bed teeth, and cut off the ones
that are too longo
I most respectfully ask that authority for this necessary ex
penditure be granted at an early date.
Very respectfully,
Your obedient servanto
A Hilut
s√∫perintendent.
