Active Trachoma were found in an enrollment of 450 pupils and only
three were deemed sufficiently acute to demand operation. The work
of the field Dentist, Doctor Rodriguez, has resulted in great im
provement in the condition of the pupils' teeth and it is to be
hoped that this work will be followed up by regular visits, in or
der that the standard set may be maintained.
The new equipment furnished will greatly help the physician
and nurse in their work. The same consists of an electric steri
lizing outfit, a nurse' s desk with filing cabinet, temperature
and clinical history sheets, a nabulizer and compressed air outfit
for treatment of nose and throat troubles and operating table with
facilities for storing dressings and solutions.
The buildings and grounds are in good condition and the health
of children is carefully guarded. The food is plentiful, well
cooked and served. The monthly weighing of pupils has been helpful
in determining their physical condition. These found to be losing
in weight have been given special attention and special diet. The
school is located in what is known as the" well- man' s country and
is fortunate in climate and surroundings.
Doctor C. Le Roy Brock, who has been in charge of the health
department of the school for the greater part of the year was re
cently transferred and promoted. The school is without a physician
at present.
