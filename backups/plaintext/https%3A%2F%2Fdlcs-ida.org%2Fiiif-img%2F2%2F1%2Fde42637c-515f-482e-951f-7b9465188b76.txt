I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your Circular lotter
of January 6, 1899, and also the Treatise on Osier Cultur, which came
under separate cover,
In answer to your lotter, I would inform you that the soil in this
section is very unfavoreble for growing anything, unlots en abundant
amount of water is available.
Our supply of water is very limited and entirely inadequate for
our present neads.
Ir the soil and climate were favorable I would tako spocial in.
terest in the cultivation of this willow, out with out limited supply
of water etc I do not believe in the advisibility or trying this an
dustry.
Vory ruspeorfully,
your sovdaunt servent
