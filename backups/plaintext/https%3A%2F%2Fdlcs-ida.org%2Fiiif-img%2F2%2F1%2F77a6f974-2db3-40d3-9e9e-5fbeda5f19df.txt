including statistics and comment incident to the fiscal year 1919
months of July 1918 to February 1919. A change of superintendents
having been indicated( correspondence of December 1918 and January
1919) information concerning the epidemic of influenza during
October, November and December 1918 has been included in this report.
The Annual Report( Narrative Section) for the fiscal year 1918 has
be en delayed because of a number of reasons. The fiscal year 1919
began with the Moqui Agency office bare of clerks and it was not
until October 1918 that these vacancies were filled, and then with
persons who had never performed similar work. The time spent in
education of green persons must be considered. The epidemic of
Spanish Influenza for three months practically killed the work of
the offioe. The installation of the general accounting system,
completion of inventories, disivision of property tuto fourteen
different units and the general education of all persons on the
reserve who will have to attend such accounts, could not be
& ccommodated in a short period of time. Nocessary work incident
to the indicated change of superintendents did not tend to save
time in the mattor of belated reports. And the 1920 Annual
Estimates had to be attended to whether the Annual Report was
made or not.
There is yet to make( or rather copy) the Moqui Census.
Annotated copies of the Hopi census are kept in the Moqui office
and posted to date from the monthly reports of vital statistics.
These changes concern a list of 2300 names, and without& stenographer
and rapid typist, clean copies for submission to the Indian office
cannot be made as speed Ily as would seem is expected. Where 18 no
census of the Navajo Indians under the Moqui Agonoy, and, unle88
orders are received to stop all other routine work and to employ
the full force of the Agency on such a census( together with the
employment of additional interpreters), it is not likely that a
proper Navajo census can be made.
It is believed that the Moqu Reservation has at least 1800 Navajo.
Prior to the Spanish Influensa, the Nava jo figures were given as
1940( 1918 statistical report); it is known that 140 died of the
disease or its complications; therefore for the purposes of the
1919 report, 1800 Navajo will be assumed as sufficient.
The Hopi census is as accurate as one can be mado. The 1918
figures in the statistical report gave 2285 Hopi.
