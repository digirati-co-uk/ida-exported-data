We are Nothing but Drops of RainBy Fantasia LonjoseWe were born in the fountain of youthYoung molecules of water,Bathing in the innocent truth.Now we fall into the mystery of lifeIncreasing as solitary dropsShatter down, breaking the stillness that surroundsIn drops we fall, control is lost.Our rushing rhythm can' t be stopped.We bring moisture to the dry, old ground,It holds together as its sand drowns.Don' t judge us for the coldness thatour rainstorm can bringBecause, as teens, we wonder howlife even happens.Our actions as rain are done without thought,Our reason for coming is a continuing cycleThis unexplainable of just being- a rainClicks together in one linking chain.Being the nutritious water, we quenchThe thirst of an Indian flower,Whose roots grow stronger each dayby our daily watering.Blooming independently in freedom,We grew this S. F. I. S. flower.97
