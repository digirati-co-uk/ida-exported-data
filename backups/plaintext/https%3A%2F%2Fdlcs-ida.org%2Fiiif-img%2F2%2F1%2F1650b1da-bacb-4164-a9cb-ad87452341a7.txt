submit the following:
In regard to the change of location of this school to a
different point in the canyon I see no reason to justify such a
change and expense.
The reason alleged is that the buildings
at present are not suitable and also that the arroya which now
washes down through the middle of the canyon threatens to carry
away the present buildings.
While there I gave considerable at
tention to the typography of this canyon.
It is not long, proba
I do not know of
any
bly not more than three or four miles,
location in the canyon that would supply the necessary water except
The Gov
ing at the point where the buildings are now located.
ernment has invested a large amount of money in these buildings
and the present sites is excellent.
I have appended herewith
a rough map showing the location of the buildings in the canyon
width of the canyon and the course of the arroya.
It will be
seen by said map that the width is from 150 to 350 feet.
In
reference to this arroya which is said to threaten the buildings
I should not think it as serious as represented.
No doubt this
arroya has existed for a hundred years past.
At present the
* wash", or channel of this arroya will average about six feet, or
say from four to six feet across the top with a varying depth of
from three to six feet.
The bottom of the canyon is a plain
surface with side walls of sand stone rising to a heighth of 300
or four hundred feet.
During the greater part of the year there
is no water in this arroya- it is only during the spring floods
that this" wash" occurs.
On one or two occasions, I have been
informed that the water has been so high that it reached some of
the lower parts of the buildings, but doing no serious damage.
