Lenpp School& AgencyLeupp, Arizona.Fiscal year closing, June 30, 1926.GeneralThe Leupp Jurisdiction comprises the territory lying inRange 11 and Eastward to Range 21 inclusive and Townships 21, 22,23 and 24 North G.&. S. R. M. There are also a few allotmentsin Range s 18, 19 and 20 East and Township 20 North G.&. S. R. M.There are approximately fifty townships of land, therefore, within the Leupp Jurisdiction.This territory lies within the limits of the old land grantof the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company made some years ago,which grant gave that company the alternate odd numbered sectionslying along the railroad cite for a distance of forty miles eitherway. It will be seen, therefore, that the Indian land on the LeuppJurisdictionactually comprises every other section within theterritory above described, being the even numbered sections. Allthe territory has been surveyed except that portion lying withinRanges 11, 12, 12, 13 and 14, this portion of the Reservation beingapproximatelytwenty- four miles square has not been surveyed and itis on this portion where the agency and school buildings are located.The area making up the Leupp Jurisdiction is a desert region,growing only a limited amount of de sert grsses. It is estimatedthat the territory will graze stock at the rate of 60 acres for acow and 12 acres for a sheep. The grazing possibilities of theLeupp Reservation, therefore, are quite limited and it is moreapparent that the grazing facilities are less than the stock ofthe Indians would require when the condition is understood thatonly half of the land is available for the use of the Indians.
