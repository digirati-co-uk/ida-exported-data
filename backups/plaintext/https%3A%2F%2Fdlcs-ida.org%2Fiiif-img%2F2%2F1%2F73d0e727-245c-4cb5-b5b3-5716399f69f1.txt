give it to them, --on the ground, probably, that as the land had beenallotted to the Indians its product belonged to them.The authority ofMajor Williams to carry out his orders seemed to me then to be unquestionable, and the demand came so unexpectedly that I hardly knew what todo.I was there alone, without assistance or means of communicating withlegal counsel, and no time was afforded me to ascertain my rights orassert them. Realizing the hopelessness of my situation, I offered noresistance to the execution of William's order, and my grain was confiscated to the last bus hel.Since the early part of 1892 I have lived on this place constantly, making it my exclusive home.I have worked hard to improve andcultivate it, and it is all I have in the world.I am a poor man. Ihave absolutely no means of livelihood aside from the cultivation of thisplace. Since I bought it, I have added very largely to the improvementsupon it, and how have, besides the grain fields, an orchard of 200 treesin bearing, and a nursery of 4,000 apple trees, 400 pear trees, 100cherry trees, a bout 100 apricot trees, and 100 peach trees, all acquiredby my own hard labor.I have paid county and territorial taxes on thisproperty annually ever since buying it, and before I bought it, thetaxes were paid by my grantors. It has always been treated as an improved farm, and no Indi an on earth ever had a shadow of claim or rightto it.I ask no favors from the Government.I want nothing rightlybelonging to any Indian. All I desire is to be left in peaceable possession and enjoyment of that which is rightfully and honestly mine.SelloutebekerSubscribed and sworn to before me this31st day of May, A.
