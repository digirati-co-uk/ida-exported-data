The Albuquerque sohool 18 located in the valley of the
Rio Grande, one mile north of the city of Albuquerque. Albu
querque 18 centrally located, easy of access, and is the larg
est city in the state. It has a population of 30, 474. The
altitude is 4, 949 feet and the climate is dry and temperate,
not hot in the summer nor very cold in the winter. It is a
healthful climate and altitude for any people, but especially
so for the Navajo, Zuni, Hopi and Pueblo Indians, whose home
conditions are similar with respect to altitude and olimate to
that of Albuquerque. Generally speaking the members of these
tribes are quite healthy and do satisfactory work at this school.
Since the completion of the new sleeping poroh addition to
the small boys' dormitory, the capacity of the school is rated
at 850, divided as indicated below..
Large boys' dormitory, 254.
Small boys! dormitory, 192.
Girls' dormitory, 388.
Students generally housed at the hospital, domestic science
building, and in the quarters of employers, number 16 or more.
It is the opinion of the Superintendent that the capacity
of this school should not be increased beyond 850. To do so
would require additions to dormitories, dining hall and academic
building, at least, and it would be expensive to enlarge these
10.
