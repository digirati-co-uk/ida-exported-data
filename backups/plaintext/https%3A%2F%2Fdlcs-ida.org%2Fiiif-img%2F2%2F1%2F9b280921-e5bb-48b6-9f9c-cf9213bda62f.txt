physical examinations performed, exclusive of the patients at
Sanatorium and Hospital, was 1954.
We are well equipped for carrying on medical and health work on
reservation and at the school, except that we need a ne automobile.
No additional employees are needed for health work in this jurisdic
tion.
Field Nurse's work has been directed towards sanitation in the
Indian homes, and assistance to the Indian woman before and after
childbirth.
The Field Nurse visits the camps and assists the Indian woman in
any way she will permit. Have been without the services of an
active Field Nurse most of the year, hence the work has not been
very effective.
A regular Field Nurse has recently arrived, and her work and interest
to date, has been satisfactory.
