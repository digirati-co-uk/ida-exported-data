4.referred to.I reallotted lands, as per applications transmitted herewith,to 6 Indians who relinquished their forer allotments, and to 10 newapplicants, making 16 allotments, aggregating 603.40 acres, thus allotI also transmit herewith, marked Exhibit No. 15, a plat showingmesa orthe 16 allotments made, with the names of the allottees shown on therespective sub- divisions or allotments, and as will be seen, by a reference to said plat, some of the allotments are all bottom lands, everyfoot of which is tillable, whilst others contain considerablebluff land, with portions badly cut into by Moencopie Creek, the bedof which averages about 20 feet deep, with very steep banks that are,with every freshet, breaking off and being carried down the Wash, hencethe difference in area of the several allotments.It may be proper to state, that in making the reallotments andnew allotments, the area of the respective allotments was determined bythe quality of the land in the respective tracts, and at the same timegoverned by the fact that none of the Indians of Moencopie Wash arecultivating to exceed six( 6) acres, and it is generally believed bypersons familiar with the requirements of the Moencopie Indians, thattwenty( 20) acres of arable land, susceptible of irrigation, as all thebottom lands in this particular portion of Moencopie Wash are, is amplefor any Indian family, and as much as they need or will ever be able toproperly cultivate.In this connection I would respectfully suggest the holding upfor the present these allo tments in Moencopie Wash, and until action istaken on the report that I will submit with reference to enlarging theNavajo reservation, as instructed by Department letter of March 14th,1899, which report I will submit tomorrow, and in case the reservationlines are extended so as to include Tuba City and moencopie in the extension, the lands being chiefly adapted for grazing purposes only, itwould, in my judgment, be better for the Indians, and in the interestof the service, to have all lands of the reservation remain unallotted,
