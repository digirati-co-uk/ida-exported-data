Ruins.
Quarters are not yet available for farmers
at these points. A general mechanic to have general
oversight of the shops and building, also a painter to
keep all buildings properly painted are needed. A
nurse, hospital cook and male attendant for Navajo
hospital were allowed during the year. During the
year no physician was located at the Tohatchi School
owing to certified eligibles refusing to accept appoint
ment. A physician at this point is a necessity for the
School as well as the hundreds of Indians living in that
part of the reservation.
I have no difficulty in maintaining proper order
on the reservation.
I consider the dances indulged in by the
Navajos as harmless. During the spring time the
Hos Kon or Fire dance, lasting one night is given.
In the summer several squaw dances continuing three nights
in succession at different places about 15 miles apart.
S
The Yea Be Chia dance which last nine days, is a relig
ious affair and is given in the latter part of October
and the early pert of November. This is a costly affair
and only the well- to- do Indians are able to give it.
It is estimated that this dance costs the giver from
four to five hundred dollars.
