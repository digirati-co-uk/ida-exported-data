This applies only to the buildings situated in the flat, almost
on the level with the arroya.
Most of the buildings are lo
cated on the North side of the Arroya on an incline not exceed
ing 15 degrees.
It is right that the Government should con
sider all these circumstances and conditions and understand them
fully, and I am aware that there is liable to be some trouble in
regard to this arroya, but instead of changing the school- build
ings and abandoning them and putting the Government to the enor
mous expense of changing their location and erecting other build
ings, my opinion is that it would be better to change the loca
tion of the arroya by going 200 feet above the presenttbuildings
and throwing the arroya over on the South side of the South uh
wall of the canyon.
I estimate that perhaps a ditch along
this South wall of 1000 feet would be necessary.
It need not
be a costly affair.
Mr. Shoemaker, Acting Subagent in charge
of the Keam's Canyon office says that with the help of the Indians
this is practicable, in the meantime the old arroya should be fill
ed up with brush, stone& c., and cultivated.
I would estimate
the cost of filling up the old arroya and constructing a new ar
roya on the south side of the canyon to not exceed$ 1200. or
$ 1500.
The cost of erecting new buildings would probably
amount to$ 75,000.
In fact I was unable to find any place where
they could be erected to any advantage.
In regard to any fu
ture buildings that are to be put up at that point I would advise
the Government that they be put well back on the North side, on
the slight elevation, out of the reach of this arroya or any floods
that might occur.
In speaking of floods I do not anticipate at
any time any serious flood from the fact that the drainage into
