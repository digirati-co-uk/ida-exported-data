Mt. Pleasant Indian school,Annual Report, 1919.NARRATIVESection III- SchoolsThe city of Mount Pleasant, Michigan, has an estimatedpopulation of 5000, and is a great school town, There arefour separate systems of schools: The Public schools, Centralstate Normal and state Training school, a Catholic school orAcademy, and the Dederal Indian school, and I am happy tostate that the best of harmony exists between these variousinstitutions, and all intercourse is of the most friendlyna ture.Ene tertainments are given at the different schoolsand all other schools are always invited to attend, andspecial teachers' meetings that might prove of benefit arealways attended by the teachers of the other schools. ASfor the Indian School, we try to arrange one or two entertainments to which we invite the other schools, and same are verylargely attended.ingtheattendsthebelieftooferewey,theIndianRegarding the attendance of Indians in the publicschools of Michigan, I am of the belief that this is almosta failure, not because the schools are too far away fromtheir homes but on account of the transient life of the Indians.They live wherever there is work for them to do, in loggingcamps in the winter and in the berry fields and fishing sectionsin the summer; in fact, any place where they can secure employment. Of course, this is speaking of the majority of them.There are special cases where some own goog- sized farms aredoing well, and are on equal standing in their communities withthe white people. But the roving life of the majority naturallyput the children a fr behind their white brothers, especiallyin their school work, and many would rather remain awayaltogether then to attend the public schools only intermittantly.The pupils of this school have the advantage of a twoyears' course of vocational training; this covers engineering,carpentry, farming and dairying for boys; while the girls havesewing, domestic science and nursing, al√≠ as prescribed by thecourse of study outlined by your office.
