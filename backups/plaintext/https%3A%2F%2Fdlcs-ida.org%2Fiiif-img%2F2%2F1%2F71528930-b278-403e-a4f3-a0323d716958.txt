SCHOOL IS DISMISSET
And so, the 1948 Tequayo Annual has come to its close, but we shall
not forget the experiences gained from our school year here. As the busses
load in the noon day sun or the early morning dawn we will depart rich
rich from experiences gained during the past year.- a richness of heart
that is our dividend for the conscientious Investment of effort that came
from all of us. And as we go on-- we shall meet: with fervent hope and a
kind of rekindled faith, the job of building for peace in this our day.
