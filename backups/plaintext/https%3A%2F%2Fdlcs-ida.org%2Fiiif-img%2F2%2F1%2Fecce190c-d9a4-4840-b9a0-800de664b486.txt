Regarding Industries--- 3S OF INDRECEIV ноThe flocks and herds are increasing in number and improving inquality. The outlook for the future in that regard is tery promising.A great number of stock grazes on the National Forest. The restriction placed on the Indians are that they must obey a11 rules and rrorulations governing the grazing on the National Forest Reserve and theymust be careful of fires and respond when called upon to fight fires.Quite a number of them are engaged in silver- smithing, a fewbasket weavers and about eighty percent of the women are blanket weavers.No new Industries have been taken up during the year,I do not believe the office could give aid through furnishingspecial instructions in Industrial lines, outside of agricultureand stock raising.Ninety nine per cent of the Navajos on this reservation are selfsupporting, those that are not able to support themselves are too oldand helpless.The stock of white men not raised on tribal lands,I do not believe it would be a good policy to fence the grazingarea for the reason that it would, a great deal of discontent and troubleamong the Indians on acount of water.The improvments on allotments consists of fencing and buildingof small houses and sheds. The nürnber of farmers employed on thisreservation are three. A great portion of their time is devoted togiving instruction in agriculture to Indians.
