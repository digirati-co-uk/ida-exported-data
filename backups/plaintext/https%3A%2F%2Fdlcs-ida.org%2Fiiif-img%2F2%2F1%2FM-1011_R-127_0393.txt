Annual Report, 1926.San Juan Agency.With the range Brazed to its capacity, there is not anabundance or opportunity for the sheep owner to increasehis herds, nor is therean abundance of opportunity forthe returned student, who by reason of his long absence,has lost his inherited range, to repossess those rights.As I have stated above, the only limit to accumulationis the limit of opportunity and these limits are mightytell defined on the Navajo reservationThere were about 350 new pupils taken from theSan Juen reservation during the year. Two hundred and twentyof these were placed in the Miese Unit of the San JuanSchool which was opened for occupancy in the late summer;about one hundred were placed in the oadlena School toreplace pupils that had been transferred and to fill thenew capacity created by the construction of sleepingporches; end the remainder filled vacancies created atthe San Juan School by transfers to non- reservation SchoolsIt is known that there are remaining on the jurisdiction children of school age that ought to be in school.How large or smell this number may be we have little accuratemeans of ascertaining. In March 8 letter vies written to alllicensed Traders, Lissionaries, etc., operating on thereservation, asking for specific information. These peoplewere requested to furnish the narnes of Indians, tradingwith or known to them, having children of school age, together with the sex and approximate ages of such childrenThen a Government employee goes out after children theparents are immediately suspicious and conceal the childrenor send them for the time being to live with friends orkinfolk residing in other parts of the country, but theTrader and Miissionary, being intimately associated withthe Indians all the time, can learn of the existence ofthe child without causing suspicion. These people have beenmighty nice about the matter and responses have been hadfrom most of then, the returns showing about 150 childrenof school age now out of school on the jurisdiction. Thislist may be added to or it may develop that there have beensome duplications. The two district farmers, the stockman,and the superintendent have also be en endeavoring to locateevery child of school age renaining out of school end wefeel that the opinion now expressed represents approximatelythe number of children remaining on the reservation. It leastit is not wholly conjecture. We are under instructions totransfer this season100 pupils to the Chas.H. Burke School15 to the Phoenis School19
