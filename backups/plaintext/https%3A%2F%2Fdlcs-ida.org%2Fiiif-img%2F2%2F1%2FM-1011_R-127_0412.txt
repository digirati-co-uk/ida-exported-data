Annual
Report
, 1926
San
Juan
Agency
.
There
are
on this
jurisdiction
fourteen
licensed radres
and
one
, who, being
a Navajo
, operates
without license
. In addition
to these
there
are
numerous
traders living
along
the
northern
and
eastern
borders
, who
, being just
over
the
line, operete
ithout
license
. It is our opinion
that
the licensed
Trader
is,
as a rule
, fair in his dealings
with
the
ndians
. Possibly
as much can not
be said
for
the traders
operating
just
over
the line
.
Owing
to the activities
of the Oil
Companies
there has been
no
lack of employment
ior
Indians
dwelling
in the vicinity
of Shiprock
. There
has been
much
freight
to haul
all
of which
has
been
hauled
by Navajos
, and
in ad dition
a great
deal
of day
labor
, both
single
handed
and with
tean, Indians
further
out on the reservation
he ve not been
so iortunate
and
can secure
employment
only
by leaving home, and
large
numbers
of them
do leave
hone and
seek and secure
employment
to the
north
and
east
, in the lumber camps
, the
saw mills
, on the
rail
roads, with
ranchers
, stock
raisers
, and sheep
men, with
road
gangs
, and on the fesa Verde
National
Park
.
They are
excellent
workmen
along lines
that
they
are familiar
with
but are
slow
to take
up new
lines.
Last year
when one
of the drain
ditches
was being
dug
on the San
Juan
School
farm
, there
were
approx inately
100
avajos
employed
at$ 2. 00 per
day. These
men spent
eight
hours
daily
standing
in mud and
water
knee deep
shoveling
mud and
I was
sure
standing
over
then
making them
earn
their
money
. Some
of the sugar
beet
growers
of Aztec
, N. M., desiring
help, called
at the Agency
and
as a result
15 of these
diggers
took
their
time
and went
to the beat
fields
and
within
a week
every
one
of them
was back
seeking
his old
job. They
are slow
to take
up a new line
of work
, but once
having
acquired
the
neck
they are
excellent
at almost
any
task. A few years
ago
there was
not a freighter
among
then
the. t could
be classed
as" fair
", to- da. y they
swarm
to Farmington
and
unload 150, 000 pounds
of four
inch
dron. pipe. and
have
it all on their
wagons
and
headed
Ior
the oil
Iields
in four hours
time
. They
will
handle
boilers
weighing
from
10, 000 to 14, 000
pounds
and deliver
them
at the
oil fields
. In fatt
they
do not
stop
at any piece
of
freight
large
or small and
the more
there
is of it the better
they
like
it. They will
quarrel
among
themselves
to secure
possession
of such freight
as there
may be to haul
and, if there
is no need of haste
in delivery
, they
will
haul
the
stuff
part
way, unload
it and go back
after
another
load, just
to prevent
