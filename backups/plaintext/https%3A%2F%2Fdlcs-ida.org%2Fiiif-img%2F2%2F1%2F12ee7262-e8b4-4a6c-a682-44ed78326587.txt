- 4Law and Order.I do not believe the Indians of either tribe on thisreservation make any home brew or intoxicating beverages.We have no peyote or mescal users on this reservation.I have never heard of a single case of white people using itor bringing it on the reservation.We do not allow extracts to come on the reservation.We do not need any additional legislation so far as I cansee to improve the liquor situation. Fortunately these Indiansare pretty free from liquor difficulties.An effective police force with a white man at the head ofit deputized by state laws would assist us materially in botheffecting a proper law and order organization and in preventingthe use of liquor on the reservation.I cannot see that the national prohibition act affectedthese Indians any except that it made it harder for them toget liquor in case they went to the railroad.I do not believe we have any drug users on the reservation.The Indians drink a great deal of coffee and so far as Iknow do not manufacture any beer, whiskey, wine, or otherintoxicating liquors.The law making it an offense to have liquor in ones possessionis a big help to superintendents of Indian reservations.These Indians, both Navajos and Hopis, are inveterategamblers. Next to the immorality of these people, gambling isa very bad thing and one of our principal problems. They usestick games, grass games, dice, cards, or any other form orpractice in which they might gamble. The women are as bad asthe men among the Navajos.We are continually confisoatingagambling devises and urgingthe native police to eliminate gambling at every opportunity.There have been no important decisions rendered duringthe fiscal year by either the state or federal courts affectingour Indians.
