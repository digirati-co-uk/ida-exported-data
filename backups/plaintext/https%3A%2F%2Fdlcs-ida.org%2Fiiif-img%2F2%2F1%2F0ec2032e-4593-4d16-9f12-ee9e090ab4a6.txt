Section 1.--- Law and Order( cont..)
" Tiewin" is made by these Indians, but not to any
extent, as they do not have the material to use in making it and
no other native drinks are made.
Gambling is practi√©ed more by the old men and women,
than among the younger generation, and not to any extent by either.
There is no gambling at or near the agency and from personal know)
edge, there is but very little practice of the evil.
The outlook, for controling the traffic of" tiswin"
making and the stamping out of the evil of gambling, is very
good.
