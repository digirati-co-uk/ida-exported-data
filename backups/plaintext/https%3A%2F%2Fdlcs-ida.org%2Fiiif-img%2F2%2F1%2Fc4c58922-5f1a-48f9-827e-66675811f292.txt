Page7â€¢Loupp,Arizona,* Section III-- Sohools.( oont.)porHT10 TamaThe most pressing needs of the school at the present time are:First, the enlargement of the dormitory building to inoreasethe capacity of the school from 68 to 150 pupile; second, theInstallation of a larger 1995 for the Bohool pumping plant( this 1945 has already been ordered); and third, the installation of a mangl. to complete the laundry equipment. Thefirst of these mattere has been presented to your orelos forConsideration, the second has been given disposition-- and the# 945 is supposed to have been ordered by your orrice; buttho necessity of the last named, or the mangle has never beenbrought to the attention of your office. We have a steamlaundry, and the equipment is completo ezo opt the manglo, andunder the present conditions much additional labor from boththe children, and the employees having charge of the laundryand the engines in it, in addition to the extra amount offuel consumed, om is required. It is believed that thefuel consumed and the time required to do this work by handwould pay for the manglo in a short time, as the efforts putforth by the children and employees in doing this work by handcould be more profitably utilized in doing other work.The present employe force is considered sufficientfor the present enrollment.This school has had no graduates, as none of thepupils are advanced beyond the fourth grade.The character of the work of the Mission school underthe supervision, is shown under Section I--- Law and Order.
