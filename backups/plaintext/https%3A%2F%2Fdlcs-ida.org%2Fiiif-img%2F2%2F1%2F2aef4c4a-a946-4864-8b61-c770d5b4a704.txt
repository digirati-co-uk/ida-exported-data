The Honorable Chas. H. Burke, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, vis
ited the school for a day in June, 1926. Honorable E. B. Meritt paid us
a visit in November, 1926. The visits of the Commissioner and his as
sistant have proved of great benefit to the school.
Miss Edna Groves, Supervisor of Home Economics, visited the school
several times during the year, organized the Home Economics department,
and made many suggeztions with reference to its conduct. Her suggestions
for promoting health of pupils were valuable. Supervisor William W.
Coon spent about ten days at the school inspecting all of the depart
ments. His suggestions regarding the academic work and the trades were
pertinent and valuable. Members of the Institute for Government Research
making a survey of Indian affairs spent some time at the school, and
made a survey of each and every department.
The relationship existing between the school and the public school
authorities, including city, county and state is most pleasant and has
Â· developed into hearty cooperation in many things. Our relations are al
so pleasant with all private and church schools, without regard to denom
