March
30,
We finished putting
the tanning paste on the skins.
We rolled them up, and put them away until Monday. Some
of the boys think that the skins will be hard when we get
through working on them.
Some of the girls started to make baskets out of
yucca leaves. Others started to make a stone floor under
the porch
. The dust is so thick outside
our door, so we
thought
a stone floor might look better, and help to keep
the dust down.
We worked on some corner designs
for the lapboards
.
Some of them have the designs
drawn on the boards.
Others
had not finished
working
them out on paper.
We talked
about
making real Navajo designs. Lindy made a very pretty design,
but when I held it up for the class to make suggestion
, Del
thought that part of it was not Navajo. Lindy changed the
design, and we thought
it looked even better.
The chairs we were trying to make got broken. The
hoops we used were not strong enough for the large boys and
girls. Marcelino
thought
they should be thrown away.
The
children
seemed
to want to throw things away, when they
get broken.
I suggested that we might be able to find
stronger hoops and repair them, Leonard
started
to fix
his
up.
He had worked
hard on it.
The children
seem to think it is going to be very
nice when they can sit on the floor on the skins.
Marcelino
and Andy put some stain on one of the
Bulletin
boards. They thought
it looked better when they
had finished
. It harmonized
with the rest of the room.
