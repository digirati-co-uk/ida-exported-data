March30,We finished puttingthe tanning paste on the skins.We rolled them up, and put them away until Monday. Someof the boys think that the skins will be hard when we getthrough working on them.Some of the girls started to make baskets out ofyucca leaves. Others started to make a stone floor underthe porch. The dust is so thick outsideour door, so wethoughta stone floor might look better, and help to keepthe dust down.We worked on some corner designsfor the lapboards.Some of them have the designsdrawn on the boards.Othershad not finishedworkingthem out on paper.We talkedaboutmaking real Navajo designs. Lindy made a very pretty design,but when I held it up for the class to make suggestion, Delthought that part of it was not Navajo. Lindy changed thedesign, and we thoughtit looked even better.The chairs we were trying to make got broken. Thehoops we used were not strong enough for the large boys andgirls. Marcelinothoughtthey should be thrown away.Thechildrenseemedto want to throw things away, when theyget broken.I suggested that we might be able to findstronger hoops and repair them, Leonardstartedto fixhisup.He had workedhard on it.The childrenseem to think it is going to be verynice when they can sit on the floor on the skins.Marcelinoand Andy put some stain on one of theBulletinboards. They thoughtit looked better when theyhad finished. It harmonizedwith the rest of the room.
