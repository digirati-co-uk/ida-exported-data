17.In my opinion it will be necessary tocontinue the government schools here for an indefinite period of time. This, for the reason thatthe 8e are among the last of the Indians to be provided with government schools and they are veryreactionary by nature, and slow to take up civilized methods of 1iving. Many of the children, sofar, have never seen the inside of a governmentschool. It would be good business to provide atthe earliest possible date, facilities for theeducation of all the children of this jurisdiction.In this way the government would be making it possible for the coming generation to break away fromthe native ideas, customs and superstitions, andas a consequence, make much greater progress.As long as the majority are uneducated and followold time native customs, the effects and results ofeducation are to a great extent lost.18
