. One of those was a girl who had never
been" ry Atario
and the other was one who had always enjoyed excellent tax
health, and indeed showed no symptoms of being unwell in any way
until she was suddenly taken with a light homorrhago. Both thes.
pupils were at once. Tomoved to their homes, there fortunately being
no smaller childron in either family to take the contagion. Each
of them carried with them a pamphlet put out by the Government on
the treatment of consumption and precautions to ba taken. I am
in hopes that some day there may be a general sanatarium where
such eas as may be placed, and I am confident that until some such
institution is provided that there is little hope of oradicating
tuberculosis from amongst the Indians. It is encouraging, however,
to note from the conversation of pupils and their parents that
there is a growing feeling among the Indians of the danger of the
disease and of it' s contagious character
In addition to the above mentioned cases of tuber.
culosis we had one case of pneumonia, not a severe one, and the pa
ti ont made a rapid recovery
Mumps in a mild form also in
vaded the school, but required little treatment and all recovered
in a short time.
The literary work of the school has been carried on
under the charge of Miss Hilton, a veteran teacher in it the service
She is most assiduous and faithful in her work, and pupils make
good progress under her instruction
I havO noted, however, that
the best work is done by pupils who spend their morning hours in
the school room. Those who are engaged in industrial work in the
morning lose the freshness of spirit that alone can enable them
to do their literary work with best results. I wish it were possible
