31- HopiCrops and Fencing:-- I note more crops and fencing thisyear than any year since I came- 1923. The Indians are using morewire and putting up better fencing around their crops.The cropslook better than in former years. Asked why they are so much moreactive this year in this respect the Indians tell me they felt itmore necessary this year than in former years, on account of thegeneral depression, scarcity of money, poor sale of lambs, lowprice of wool, etc.E.
