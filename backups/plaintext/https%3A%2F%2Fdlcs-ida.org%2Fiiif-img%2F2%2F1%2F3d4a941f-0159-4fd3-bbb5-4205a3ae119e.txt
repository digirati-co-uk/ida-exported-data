Santa Fe, NM., July 28, 1924.From the best available information, a pipe stillof 300 bbls. a day capacity, with about 1500 bbls, ofstorage and sufficient boiler capacity, could beerected for between$ 15,000 and$ 20,000, although itmight be possible to cut this figure down by more accura te knowledge of the conditions. The cost of operating the plant, including fixed charges to write off$ 20,000 in two years, would probably not exceed 40g abarrel when operating on 300 bbls. a day; this including labor, fuel, repairs, and so on. Basing a calculation on 40g for running the oil, and estimating fueloil at$ 1.00 a barrel, the value of the crude would beas follows:75%- 30.75 gals, gasolire 615420%- 8.4 gals. fuel oil 6 92.38%$ 4.65.1975Deduct cost of operation@ 40 Â¢ bbl.Estimated approximate profit per bbl.4.8475.404.45It will be evident from the above calculationsthat there is a considerable margin of safety in thefigures and that this apparent value for the crude isnot less than is shown.If the Hogback crude were the only crude yetdeveloped in the field, it would not be easy for thegovernment on behalf of the Indians to insist on anyother evaluation of the crude than such as the Midwestmight be willing to concede; but as another pool hasalready been developed on the Rattlesnake, which, asstated above, will probably develop a 500 bbl. dai lyproduction, the government is, it seems to me, in eposition to insist on an adequate evaluation of theproduct of both leases. It seems very evident thatto value this product at as low 88$ 2.00 a barrel wouldbe unwarranted and that$ 3.00 a barrel, or more, wouldbe much nearer its actual worth in estimating Indianroyalties.
