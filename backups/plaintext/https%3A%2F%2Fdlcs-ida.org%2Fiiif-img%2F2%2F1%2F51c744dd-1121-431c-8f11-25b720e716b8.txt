celebratingPotential GenerationsTeachersMolders of the FutureMost folks well worth a memoryHave statues still in stone,But teachers mold their monumentsIn Gving flesh and bone.The student who goes out in GfeAnd makes a famous name,Admits into the heart of itSome teacher shares the fame.No skilful doctor ever savedThe lives of humankind,Without the seed some teacher storedWithin the fertile mind.AU lawyers, dentists, engineers,All who are beloved by men,Remember what some teacher taughtAnd quote it now and then.Yes, teachers mold their monument.They build themy year by year...Not like the ancient pyramidsSo awesome and austere;Which time in time will wear away,But spurning solemn stone,Out teachers mold eternallyIn Gving flesh and bone.â€“ Margaret RorkeRobbie Plummer, Principal, addresses an audience at graduation.Rules for Teachers: 18721.
