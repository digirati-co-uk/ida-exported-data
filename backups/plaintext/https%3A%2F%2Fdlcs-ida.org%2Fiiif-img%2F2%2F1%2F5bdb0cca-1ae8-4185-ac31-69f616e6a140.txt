10IWith respect to field matrons, it is believed that this classof employe reaches its highest efficiency on the Moqui IndianReservation.At least that has been the comment of inspectingofficials.The Hopi population is reached in nearly every methodthat a field matron may present, always considering the allotmentof funds.The field matrons are properly located at present, but theactive work of the most important matron on the reservation might befurthered and aided by the construction of better quarters asrecommended earlier in this report.Generally speaking, the Moqui Indian Reservation having hadallowed four physicians and four field matrons, together with theconstruction of a quite large and thoroughly equipped hospital, thegeneral health and sanitary work shows a decided increase over thatprior to 1913. The greatest handicap is the fact that the IndianService cannot procure physicians and that increases of salaryjustified by all phases of the work will not be allowed for thephysicians who are actually in the Service.So much has been saidon this subject that it would seem an annual report can scarcely hopeto produce any decided change; but if a flat recommendation is desiredthe Service may procure and retain able physicians just as soon as itdecides to pay these professional men a professional man's salary.17
