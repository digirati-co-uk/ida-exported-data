Allotments, etc.,( Cont'a)
The chief industry among the Navajos at the present time is that of
stock raising. They have at present 202,900 head of sheep and goats
( not counting this year's lambs and kids) 1,500 cattle( young calvos not
included) and approximately 6,000 horses. Total area of land used for
grazing purposes, including leased lands, aggregates an acreage of 1,263,000.
The ratio of acres of range to head of foraging animal is too low. In
other words, there is insufficient range to take care of the present number
of grazing animals. This situation bas resulted in sovore overgrazing of the
ranges. This unfortunato state of affairs has existed for many years past.
As a consequence the native grass and browse has been depleted to the
extent that erosion has set in and has further devitalized the land. To
maintain the present herds, it is of utmost importance that present areas
should be onlarged.
( 4) Land Sales and Land Leases.
The Nava jos on the Eastern Jurisdiction do not have sufficient land
to graze the livestock that they have at present. The local administration
is therefore striving to secure more land for grazing purposes as well as
to develop the agricultural possibilities. For that reason, no land is being
sold. Nearly 254,000 acres of land are now being leased by the Government
for the Indians. Limited range nocessitates the overgrazing in practically
all areas which the Indians occupy.
