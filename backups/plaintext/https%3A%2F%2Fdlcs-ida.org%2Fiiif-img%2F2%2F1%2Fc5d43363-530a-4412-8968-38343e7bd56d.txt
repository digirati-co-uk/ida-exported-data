The Student Council has been actively using the last
few weeks to increase the number of available
activities for the students. Recently they announced
the formation of the Brave Hound Travel Agency.
Though the first trip to the zoo had to be cancelled,
due to the sickness of the driver, the second trip to
Coronado Shopping Center in Albuquerque went off
smoothly. The next trip advertised is on December 4
to an Albuquerque roller rink, also in the planning
stages are trips to see the Lobos play and to a local
bowling alley. In Canteen news the Council sponsored a
tournament night on November 16 which featured live
music by T. D. K., a local rock group. The Council is
currently negotiating for the purchase of a stereo
system for the Canteen. They are also considering the
purchase of a video disc player. The Council' s
expanded budget for this year is covering a wide
variety of educational and recreation activities. They
have approved grants for everything from tropical fish
to calculators. Perhaps the most exciting plan in the
works is the Council' s plan to purchase an activity bus
which could be used by all organizations at the school
and painted with the school' s emblem. The Council has
their eye on a 1975 school bus complete with radio and
a good heating system. The Council hopes to wind up
the 1982 year by hosting the city wide officers'
meeting and performing for children at St. Vincent
Hospital.
