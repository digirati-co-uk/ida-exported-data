POPULATION
The kuni Indians have a tribal governing
body consisting of a Governor, Lieutenant Governor,
Tenienties, war chiefs, sun priests and various other
officers. The officers are some of the progressive
and some not. Soine are a considerable hindrance to the
progress of the tribe. In spite of their political.
affairs and petty jealousies, they are as a tribe,
making fairly good progress. The fact that officers
of an extremely reactionary disposition
are not recog
nized by this office, serves as a check on them to a
considerable extent." This has a tendency to help then
adopt progressive ideas. These Indians have no annuity
or tribal funds of any kind.
