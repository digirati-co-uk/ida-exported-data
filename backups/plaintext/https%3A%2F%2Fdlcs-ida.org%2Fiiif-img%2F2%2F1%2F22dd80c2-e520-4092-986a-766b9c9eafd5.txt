Leupp Indian School& Agency.Miscellaneous.In view of the character of our soil and water as showmby analysis already referred to, it would seem to be a wasteof time and money to again undertake to raise grain or hayor in fact any vegetables upon a large scale-- except possiblybeets.Those who are well informed say that beets willassist in taking out alkali from the soil. With this inview the present plan is to plant largely of beets the comingseason in the hope that the soil will be benefitted.In conclusion it is proper to state that the employeforce has been, without exception, loyal, faithful and efficientand there has been harmony and congeniality existing at alltimes.With a good corps of employees working faithfullyand in entire harmony the work of the school and Agency hasbeen grati≈øfyingly successful.
