Hon. H. J. Hagerman( Cont.)as already said, it is impossible to tell what its boundaries are. Defendants counsel made repeated attemptsto force me to choose one of the three grants as the mainsource of the Pueblo title but I declined to do so sinceno certain proof of the connection could be made with anyone of them, except the Antoine Leroux Grant, which wasJunior in time to the Antonio Martine,and under whichthe Indians had never made their main clain of titleThe only firm ground I could find was to stand on the twodecisions of 1816 and 1823( the latter not being of a courtbut at best of a quasi- judicial tribunal), each of whichin an informal finding of fact saying, in effect that theregrant of some date or other to one Antonio Martinand that the Tenorio Tract lay within it. I urged thesedecisions as judgments of a foregin court and as findingsof fact which a modern court had no right to question.The summary so far says nothing about the intrinsic defects of the two decrees, the Tenorio deed orthe Houghton deed, all of which were bitterly attacked bydefendants. It is undeniable that none of them measureupto modern standards in precision or certainty, and no powerof attorney could be found to support either of the twodeeds. The result, insofar as based on the instrumentsmentioned, therefore, will depend upon whether a strictor a liberal construction of them is adopted. I thinkthe court could find justification in the authorities fordeciding either wayThe paper title being in this unsatisfactorystate, I therefore back ed up our contention based on itby Arling that the Pueblo had acquired a fee simple titlebetween 1818 and 1902 under the Spanish and Mexican lawsof adverse possession with color of title or subsequentto 1858 under antiar territorial statutes of New MexicoBearing in mind that the Federal Court here has decidedthat claimants under the Pueblo lands Act are restrictedto the statutes ofadverse possession set forth in thatAct and are not permitted to avail themselves of the NewMexico statute, it became necessaryto convince the courtthat the United States was not subject to the same restriction. After a bitter and lengthy argument I succeeded in thisThe Spanish and Mexican statutes of limitationwere of 11ttle help because it was impossible to showwhat sort of possession the Indians had of the Tenorio
