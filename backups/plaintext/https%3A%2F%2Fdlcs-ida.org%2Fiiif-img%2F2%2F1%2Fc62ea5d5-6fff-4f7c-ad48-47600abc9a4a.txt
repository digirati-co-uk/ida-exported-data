Every state should have a law making it a crime to sellliquor to any Indians. Federal laws on the subject should bestrengthened, particularily should it be made a ce ime to shipliquor into a reservation or even send advertisements soliciting its sale. Since the greatest difficulty experienced byspecial officers is in procuring evidence and since manyFederal judges refuse to admit what is known as" stool pidgeon"testimony, some form of statute should be enacted by Congressspecifically legalizing this class of testimony in liquor cases.
