Navajo Boarding School,
a 4 inch pipe starts from the spring and runs 1000 feet, the balance
of the distance the pipe is 2 inch, it is said the spring is 34 feet
higher than where the pipe ends, the present volume of water and the
pressure is not what it should be with that sized pipe and that
amount of head; the reason assigned for getting so little water,
and the loss of pressure, is said to be because the pipe was not
properly laid, Several times the pipe would not furnish water
enough for domestic use, at such times, water has to be taken from
the irrigation ditch for laundry use. The head or fall from the
spring to the agency and school buildings is 34 feet, from the pipe
in the ground in front of the new boys dormitory, to the top of the
needle baths is 31 feet, it will be seen that under the most favor
able conditions the pressure will not be great.
A new sewer system is now in process of construction, the buil
dings that are to be connected with it, are the boys building, the
girls building, dining hall, and the new boys dormitory, the laundry
which needs a sewer connection as much or more than any of the
buildings mentioned is not to be connected, I think this must have
been an oversight, in any event it is a mistake; the probable cost
of connectiong the laundry with the sewer would not exceed$ 150.00.
The sewer when finished will end in the middle of the Alfalfa
field, the discharge will be 4 1/2 feet below the surface, I under
stand it is the present intention to have the sewerage run from
the end of the pipe 375 feet in an open ditch to the creek, if this
is done, it will destroy a large portion of the feild, as an open
ditch with watter running in it in this soil always cuts and wash
es, and in a short time makes a large deep arroya or gully; the
sewer pipe should be continued to the creek; the cost of making
the extension would not exceed$ 325.00; another reason why the
sewer should be extended is, the discharge is to near the buildings
to allow the sewerage matter to be discharged into an open ditch
for sanatory reasons, where it would be discharged were the sewer
extended as proposed, the sewerage matter would go into the creek
some fifteen, or twenty feet below the bottom of the sewer pipe
