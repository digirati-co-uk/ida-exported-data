Duer Sir-
:
I enclost herewith, sill of Lading, covering I case of Pepper,
5 cases of Linseed oil, and t Bals., of Wagon wood in the rough, which
were recurved on November 3,1899
The Indian boy who hauled the
goods from the depot, said nothing about the 5 cases of Linseed oil
being destroyed in the wreck, and I did not discover that they were
missing until after the bill of Lading which was furnished by you was
accomplished, so I could not
make the explanat.on thereon regarding
the loss without noxing erasurve. I have prepared the new B111 or
Lading, which rucuspts for 1400 pounds of goods delivered, and have
made explanatzon on the same regaraang the loss.
The duplicate I
will forward to the Commissioner or Indian Affairs, Washington, D.C.
thw original requires a revenue stamp, I believe, but is otherwise
8ll right.
I also enclose the old Bill of Lading.
Very respectfully,
superintendent,
