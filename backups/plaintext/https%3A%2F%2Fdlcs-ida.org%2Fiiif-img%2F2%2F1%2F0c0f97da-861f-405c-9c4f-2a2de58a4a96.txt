HUMAN SAM MILL.
Well' Sgire, I see you're runnin' of yer saw mill
right along,
A rippin' slabs and soantlin' to the same old pleasin'
song:
And the creek still keeps a rushin' on the noisy water
wheel,
A' dancin' down the tail race to a new Varginny ruei.
Yer pilin' up yer lumber and yer sawdust, too, I see,
but the buzzin' of the saw mill is the ruin of the tree;
And I'm goin' to preach a sarmin' while you're
greasin' up the cogs
per ter make yer saw run smoother thro' yer big saw logs.
I've heard yer say, good neighbor, that the cruel
1 iyuor trade
Is a necessary bizness and it never can be stayed;
But I' low you must acknowledge, if you'll onlt stop
to think
that the vile trade couldn't flourish if they couldn't
get the drink.
****
And as sartin as you've got to hey the 1.9 to run
your mill,
So sartin must these liquor man hev boys to fill their
We bring the human timber and they saw it up,
you see,
Until by'n by' we're ninus both the lumber and the
tree.
There is a sort o'hummin' which I know yer love to
hear,
When the slabs are fallin' this way and the the laths a'.
pilin' here;
When Lumberis movin' outward and cash is
movin'in,
And ev'rything is prosperin! and times look good agin'.
