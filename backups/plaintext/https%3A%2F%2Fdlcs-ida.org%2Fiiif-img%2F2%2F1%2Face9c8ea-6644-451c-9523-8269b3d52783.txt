Some one"," Johnny Cake"," Lambkin"," Squeaky's Tail", and" generalStore" were favorites.This group of children were ahead of the former groups in theinterest they portrayed in all activities, their ability to expressthemselves through drawing and language, and emphasis placed uponthe most needed character development.There was very littlereading for this group, but the gain in general knowledge and abilityto use language appropriately seems to justify the slight emphasisupon reading.
