O
We will make some wool string with the spindle.
Kathryn used a spindle to spin some yarn.
The spindle went round and round and round while Kathryn
spin( spun) the yarn.
Besides original stories, some of Lucy Sprague Mitchell's
stories, poems, rhymes, and simle classical stories were used.
The
children were able to understand
and enjoy these poems and stories.
" Some one"," Johnny Cake"," Lambkin"," Squeaky's Tail", and" general
Store" were favorites.
This group of children were ahead of the former groups in the
interest they portrayed in all activities, their ability to express
themselves through drawing and language, and emphasis placed upon
the most needed character development
.
There was very little
reading for this group, but the gain in general knowledge and ability
to use language appropriately seems to justify the slight emphasis
upon reading.
