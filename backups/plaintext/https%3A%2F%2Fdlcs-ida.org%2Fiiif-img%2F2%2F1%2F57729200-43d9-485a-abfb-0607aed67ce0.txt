to pupils.
The two trace chains are needed for a dump can mich has just
been turned out of the shop and is to be used as the schaal.
The zing is greatly needed to protect the floor in front of
kitches range, and to replace some that is worn out.
The two whips called for at$ 2.00 ench aro greatly nondod for
the propar handling or horses while driving, and I do not consider the
price for thu same exorbitant.
It is impossible to buy even a
fair whip here for less than that price, and cheap whips will not last
eny length oi time.
Very respectfully.
