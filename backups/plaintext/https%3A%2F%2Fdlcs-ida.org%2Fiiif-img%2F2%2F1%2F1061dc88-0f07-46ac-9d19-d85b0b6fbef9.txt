0Hopi 15.e. On account of inbreeding and unsuitable stallionstheir teams are poor, as a usual thing. Ware urgingthe killing off of the smallest and poorest horse stockand the purchasing of horses suitable for haulingfreight, etc. Their stock is too small, too poor andunsuitable for hauling. They need good horses and fewerof them. They are horse poor, especially the Navajos andthese poor horses sadly destroy the ranges with noremuneration to the Indians. The ranges would be betteroff if they could be shot. All poor stalions should becastrated. All mares affected with dourine shouldbekilled. The horse problem, on this reserve, though, isgradually getting better each year through the death ofmany horses from Loco Weed, which gets more prevalent eachyear and which destroys much horse stock.6. We want all crop fields fenced. This is the mostimportant need of these Indians at the present time. BothTribes must have their crops protected or we can look forno improvement in farming methods or increased acreage.Can we not get some way a carload of barbed wire forthis important use?7. Indians help us without pay on the reservationroadswillingly and do all the work there is done on theseroads or tails. Without their help we would have notrails or roads.8. Of course, this country would be a fine country withplenty of water and the gboatest problem we have is thewater problem. I am a great believer, with Gregory, thatthe biggest showing and the most water for the money' canbe gotten through development of seepages or springs,rather than through wells. Wells are costly and many aredry holes and the maintenance cost is too high afteryou get them-- 80 high, usually, that half of the windmills can not be keep in operation through the season ofgreatest need to the Indians. any seepages are here todevelop and after they are developed need little care.Larger impounding reservoirs are need at the wellsnow in operation. The year's run off would be ample forthe defelopment of this country if it could only beimpounded and held for use. This can be done with money.It is the only salvation of this country. With overgrazing,less vegetation to hold the soil erosion and run offsare taking the country and always the low and best lands,many farming acros being washed away each year. We areencouraging Indians to develop privye springs for theirown use. This helps. We are helping them with dams andreservoirs on their own lands. More of these are builteach yaer. Can we not have a man visit this reserve to
