- ALLOTMENTS
No allotments have been made on this jurisdiction nor should there
be. Held as a tribal possession, it supports the tribe, divided into
allotments it will be of little value. The range is considered common
property, yet each family respects the rights of other families and
the right to graze and occupy certain areas by certain individuals
has long been recognized. When a family or individual is able to di
vert water for irrigation purposes from a wash or arroyo and convey it
to a tract of land that can be cultivated and on which the family or
individual may produce crops, the right so to do is recognized together
with the right to inclose the cultivated tract with a fence. Rights
of this character descend to the children or other heirs.
A few allotments have been made on the public domain north of the
jurisdiction. These allotments total thirty- one in number.
