In submitting the attached statist, 3
tical section of the annual report for the Mount Pleasant*
School for the fiscal year 1926, I beg to be excused from,
submitting a narrative section for this particular year
for the reason that I took harge of this jurisdiction
only last May 18 and it would appear inconsistent for me
to submit one,
If, however, some kind of a report is required,
along a narrative line, upon word from you to that effect
I shall endeavor to submit something that might be suitable
for your needs,
Very truly yours,
DE A
