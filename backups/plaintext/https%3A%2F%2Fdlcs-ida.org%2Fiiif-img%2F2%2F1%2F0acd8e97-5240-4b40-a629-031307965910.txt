be slow, but much more better progress has been made among other
Indians of the same race( Apaches).
The children
are appa
rently very bright, healthy and are the equal of any of the other
branches of the Apache Indians that are making great progress in
civilization and education,
The location of the school is

sewing, cooki. g, wash

this school
from time to time such assistance
