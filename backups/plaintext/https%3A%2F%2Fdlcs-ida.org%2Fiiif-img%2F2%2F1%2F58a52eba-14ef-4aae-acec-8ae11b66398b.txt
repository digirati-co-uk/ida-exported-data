Sir:
In answer to Office letter of October 10th, relative to the
statistical section of our annual report covering Indian children,
we have to advise that this represents a survey of the pueblo
children of this jurisdiction and not the scattered bands of
Navajos under this agency. Our census report covering the Navajo
children of school age is according to the best information that
we have, but in stating that no children were out of school we
meant the pueblo children only.
Respectfully yours,
Yowero
Lem A! Towers,
Assit. Superintendent.
