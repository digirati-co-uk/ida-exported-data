Dear Sir:
Your recent report of visits and arrangements for visiting the
Pueblos in your Dist. received, and same is satisfactory.
I desire you to settle the
dispute between Manuel Vigil and the
Santa Clara Indians;
the latter claim Vigil is on the Indian Grant, if
so he should immediately remove his" ha- ca- lie" or shack( in Wisc.
parlance) I was at the place, but did not see Vigil, and the Indians
seemed to not know very definitely as to demarkations etc. See Vigil,
get his deed, and try to make his holdings conform to his deed.
Respectfully
,
Denne
e la
all
Superintendent.
