0TAW AND ORDER.ANNUAL REPORT,1924.Page 1PUEBLOBONITO.NARRATIVE.There is great necessity for the constructionof several more quarters for employees as our schoolis now being ino reased to care for 350 children, butno provisions have been made for any such quarterssince we enrolled a hundred and fifty pupils.Your office secured transfer to this school of 12empty T.N.T. buildings from the Ordnance Bureag of theWar Department and are now being used in the constructionof more than 300 feet of sleeping porch.Our Agency force is adequate except that we shouldhave not less 6 men on the force as it is hard to doanything with many Indians unless you have a police forceto back up any policy that is desired to carry out.Thisparticularly applies to getting children into school.Wehave had some assistance from our head men but they do notlike to give much attention to urging children into schoolthey incur the ill will of the reactionaries and medicinemen to quite an extent. They have advised that they wanttheir children to remain here in school and not sentaway to other schools against their wishes particularychildren of tender age.Range trouble has lessened the past year, due to thefact that the white stockmen in several instancesencountered hard times and wer closed out and left thecountry. A late heavy snow was a God- send for earlygrass and the spring feed was the best in over 15 years,the lamb crop was good, the Indians averaged about250 per pound for their wool. They are now being offered8 to 10c per pound for their wether lambs, fall deliverywhich is a very attractive price considering the off marketof cattle. It has been our endeavor to bring abouta better and permanent adjustment for the Indians in the useof the range and at last session your office had introduceda bill to extend the reservation after purchase of rightswithin the area desired by the Department and which isessential for the future welfare of the Naveho stockmenand a factor in elimination of trouble between Indians andwhites but it seems that the Indians cause has few Championsand it remains to be seen whether justice can be done forthem.Ther has been little disturbance by Indians the pastyear and nothing of great moment, there has been somebootlegging butv officials have been able to put most of themout of business.
