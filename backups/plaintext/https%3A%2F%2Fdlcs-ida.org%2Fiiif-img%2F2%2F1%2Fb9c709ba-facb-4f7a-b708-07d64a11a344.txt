Contracts.
1.
The only body that can be called a council among
the Pueblos is the combination of Governor, other officers,
and what is termed the Principales.
In only one case
have they any resemblance to a business council, and that
is the Pueblo of Laguna
.
In the other Pueblos they are
always of the most non- progressive, uneducated members.
Very seldom have I seen, outside of Laguna, intelligent
and reliable men holding the office of Governor.
This
is to be expected since the Governor is selected by the
Cacique, who is the head of the pagan religion and the
one opposed to education and progress.
Only those known by the Cacique to favor his policies
are allowed any voice in the selection of officers and in
order to remedy this
an order from the Indian Office
directing each Pueblo to elect a council by actual vote
of its male citizens, twenty- one years old or over, should
be sent out.
This order should be sent direct to the
Governor and not through the Superintendent.
It would
have great weight with the Indians,
2.
These Indians have no trust funds and no annuities.
