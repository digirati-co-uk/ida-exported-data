038.0Pueblo Day SchoolsJuly 27, 1915.NARRATIVESection villContracts.1.The only body that can be called a council amongthe Pueblos is the combination of Governor, other officers,and what is termed the Principales.In only one casehave they any resemblance to a business council, and thatis the Pueblo of Laguna.In the other Pueblos they arealways of the most non- progressive, uneducated members.Very seldom have I seen, outside of Laguna, intelligentand reliable men holding the office of Governor.Thisis to be expected since the Governor is selected by theCacique, who is the head of the pagan religion and theone opposed to education and progress.Only those known by the Cacique to favor his policiesare allowed any voice in the selection of officers and inorder to remedy thisan order from the Indian Officedirecting each Pueblo to elect a council by actual voteof its male citizens, twenty- one years old or over, shouldbe sent out.This order should be sent direct to theGovernor and not through the Superintendent.It wouldhave great weight with the Indians,2.These Indians have no trust funds and no annuities.
