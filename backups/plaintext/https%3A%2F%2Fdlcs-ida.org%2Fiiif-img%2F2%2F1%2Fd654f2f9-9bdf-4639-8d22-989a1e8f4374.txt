SFWS SPORTS INPERSPECTIVEAthletics, character, respect and Santa Fe Indian School gohand in hand. This year as we begin to move toward anotherexciting climax for Santa Fe Indian School and our participation inthe State Tournament, we have many things to be thankful for.This year' s football team won more games than we have in overten years. The volleyball team hosted the Northern Rio GrandeTournament and won the District 3- AA championship. Our crosscountry teams both had district champions, and both teamsqualified to the State Championship at Gallup. At this time bothour boys and girls are ranked in the top five teals in the stateclass AA. Spring sports will present a challenge as our track,baseball and softball fields have been graded out in hopes ofnew construction and new fields for next school year. We will beplaying and practicing on city fields this spring. Another changethat will go into effect in the 2003/ 2004 year is that Santa Fe IndianSchool will be up in class to AAA from AA. We feel strongly that wecan compete, but we will have more traveling to do.As in all years, there is no better place to be than the Home ofthe Braves and Lady BravesMR. PORTERFIELDATHLETIC DIRECTOR
