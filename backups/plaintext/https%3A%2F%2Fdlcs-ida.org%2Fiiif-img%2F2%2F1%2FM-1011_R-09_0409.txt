ONARRATIVE./ O.NARRATIVE.Section IV,Industries.Annual Report, 1912.Car son Indian School.The produce from the School farm and garden have beenabout as usual, the suramer frosts injuring the garden considerably,wit with the result that only a partial crop was produced, it beingnecessary to purchase most of the hay and all of the grain for thesubsistence of School stock, beside a considerable amount of potatoes, onions etc. for the subsistence of pupils. According to thepre sent outlook we shall produce more vegetables etc. this summerthan usual if the early frosts do not come too early in the Fall.About twenty acres of oats were so we d this spring whichshould have yielded a sufficient quantity of oat hay for schoolhorses, but owing to a shortage of water this season for irrigat-ing purposes only a partial crop will be harve sted.Considerable new fencing about the School land is needed,the present fences being in so poor a condition that range stockvery frequently breaks into our fields with the result that considerable damage is done.Usually the supply of water for domestic and irrigat ingpurposes is sufficient for the needs of the School but this season has been an unusually dry one which has resulted in our supply of water being insufficient.As already stated there is but little opportunity forIndians in this vicinity except as laborers on ranches etc., andas domestics, there being but few openings in other lines forthem.
