- 3-Law and Order-- Section 1been indicted for this offense.As heretofore stated, nearlyall liquor obtained by Indians is through Gallup, New Mexico,the Indians invariably going there for it. There are no saloonson the reservation. The Arizona State authorities help in thesuppressi on of the liquor traffic and a little effort is beingmade on the part of public spirited men in Gallup, New Mexico,to mitigate this evil. A special Federal liquor officershould be stationed in gallup all the time. The Indians ofthis reservation do not use peyote or mescal in any form. Ifthe State of New Mexico would close its saloons such actionwould have a very beneficial effect on this reservation aspractically no liquor is obtained by Indians incrizona whichis a dry state.Gambling has been practically eliminated although ofcourse there spasimo dic spells of gambling.The decision of the Supreme Court in the Fred Nicecase, No. 681, October term, 1915, in so far as it relatesto guardianship of Indians has a bearing on the work of administration here, especially with reference to the right of theGovernment as a guardian rel tive to the sale of stock. TheOffice has already quoted this opinion to myself relative tostock sales and it would appear to have quite a bearing on same.
