Deer Sir:
I am in receipt of your letter of the 12th inst, in which you
state that you have dug the well 30 feet and found no water.
In reply
I would state that you should not dig any deeper until you receive furth
er instruotions
from me.
I will ask the Department
for authority
to dig
deeper, and when same is received will notify you.
I expect to be able
to pay you at least$ 1.00 more for each foot over 80 that go, making
at least$ 4.00 for the additional depth.
The additional authority
will
probably arrive from Washington in about Tour weeks.
Very respectfully,
oder
andere
IV.
Superintendent.
