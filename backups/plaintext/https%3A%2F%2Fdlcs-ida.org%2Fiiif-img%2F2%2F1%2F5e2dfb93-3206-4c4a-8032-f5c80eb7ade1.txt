The six Tewa pueblos of the upper Rio Grande Valleysuffered heavier losses of land by encroachment of whitesettlers than other Pueblo groups. They have yielded moreto the influence of the white man, perhaps, than have theother groups singly or collectively. However, decreasein population and gradual deterioration inthe homes, fields, and assertion of rightsLandwas apparent with them from 1850 to 1900,Lossesin which period they suffered heavy lossesin land and water. Since 1900 there hasbeen change of spirit, better opportunity,better homes, and greater production. The community homesare giving way to separate homes of one and two story construction as suits the individual. While their cultivatedacreage is limited, they are showing better interest, moreintensive application, and consequently better production,whether of the farm and range or in the arts and crafts.Time was when the Tewa pueblos had more land and waterand they grew crops in excess of their needs. They hadleisure for the arts and crafts and that they did for thelove of it, trading products of their crafts as they chosefor things they wanted, but all were artistsArts andand craftsmen as certainly as they wereCraftsagriculturists. Art is born with the pueblo,often disused, but ready always for the expression if need be. When encroachmentstook from San Ildefonso their irrigable lands and water thesting of poverty awakened the sleeping art to verify theopinion that what the Indians do well is determined by theirnative equipment, though what they may do is determined bythe circumstances of life.During the fiscal year an Exposition of Indian TribalArts was assembled and held for extended period in New Yorkand in other eastern cities, in turn presenting the bestexamples of Indian art to an awakening public interest.Indian art is peculiarly utilitarian, but none the lessartistic whether rug or blanket, basket or pottery, ornamental skin or moccasin, silver, turquoise, or painting.Initial motive in all was utility or personal adornment.Centuries of application in expression of their conceptions--religion, ceremony, utility, or what not-- gives the Indiana priceless heritage. Long ancestral training in use ofdesigns shows unbroken evolution, changing little indeed withthe advent of the white man or any other force from without.There is now and has been for centuries past this growthand development common to the Indian people, though littleappreciated by the white race until museum centers heraldthe discoveries, if that be a fair use of the word.11
