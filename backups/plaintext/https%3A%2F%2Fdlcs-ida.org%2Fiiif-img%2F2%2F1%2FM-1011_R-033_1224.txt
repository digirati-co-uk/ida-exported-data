NARRATIVE SECTION.
ATLOTMENTS
Seo. 5.
EASTERN NAVAJO JURISDICTION.
During the year there were 560 new allotments made and in a
number of cases trust patents have already been received for the
allotments made during the year. The allotment work has been very
much retarded through the transfer of special Alloting Agent,
Mr. Charles E. Roblin, though there is several years work to be
taken care of it all Indians are to receive the leases to which
they are entitled under the General Allotment Act. It is the desire
of the Indians and myself that he be returned to resume this duty
at the earliest possible moment.
