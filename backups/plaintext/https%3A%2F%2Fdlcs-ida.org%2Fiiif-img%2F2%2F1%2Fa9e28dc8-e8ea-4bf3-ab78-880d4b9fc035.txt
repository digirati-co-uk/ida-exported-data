time. We notice great improvement in the physical condition of our
pupils, especially among the girls, since our out door play ground
apparatus has been installed, and the play ground is thronged with
happy children at all hours of the day.
Realizing that a strong body is as necessary to success as
a well trained hand or mind, athletics are encouraged as much as
possible in our school. Besides football, baseball, tennis, skating,
coasting, etc. in their seasons, the pupils enjoy several outings
each year at some near by lake,
six drinking fountains have been installed in the various
buildings and about the grounds during the year, which we consider
a great step in advance toward the improvement of the general
health of our pupils.
At the present time a new vacuum steara heating system is being
put in at this school, which, when completed, will add greatly to
the comfort of the buildings during our severe Michigan winters,
besides being much more economical in the use of coal and fuel than
our present system.
