Annual Report. 1917
Industries
.
The first annual fair ever held within this jurisdiction
occurred September 19-20-21, with fine exhibits of farm products,
stock and Indian handicraft, with an attendence of 2,500 people,
The prices for all classes of stock have so advanced that
quite a number of our Indians derive a comfortable income without
much effort, so that unexpected and easy profits do not promote
industry. Too much money is a temptation to them and breeds extra
vagance and indolence and the Nave jos are less industrious now than
ever before. They received from 25% to 50 ¢ per pound for their
wool, and which they in other years only received 15 to 25 € per
pound. Of course there are many poor Indians who do not share in
the prosperity, as they have but little stock.
Wa ter development should still be a problem for your
Office to consider in the welfare of the tribe.
While the Tava jos
seem to be thriving, yet their prosperity will only be tempora ry
unless your Office takes immediate steps to secure from the rail
road company the land which they own and which the Indians have
used for many years past and is necessary for their herds for
future use.
The railroad companies own all the odd numbered sec
tions for 50 miles North of the railroad and it will be a crime
to let this land be sold to the white stockmen and the Indians
crowded out; for if they are not taken care of the Government
will have a real Indian Problem with several thousand pauperized
Ilava jos to be taken care of, as they must control the range they
use if they are to continue to be self- supporting, with a fair
chance to continue prosperous.
