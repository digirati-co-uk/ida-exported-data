Phase
Math, Science, and Technology
This year, SFIS staff and stu
dents were welcomed back on
campus with the completion of
the new Math, Science and
Technology building. The
“ MST ”, as students call it, is
phase one in the plan to con
struct a new school. The MST
is a welcome addition to the
other buildings on campus. It
encompasses 2 computer labs,
a lecture hall, exceptional class
room laboratories, and the new
location of the high school
academic office. The MST is
just one sign that times are
changing for the SFIS commu
nity.
