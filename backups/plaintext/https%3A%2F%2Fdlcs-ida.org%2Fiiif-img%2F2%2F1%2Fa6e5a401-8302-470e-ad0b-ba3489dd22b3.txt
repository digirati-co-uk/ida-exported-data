J!-7THEHOPICEREMONIESWith the exception of the Snake Dance I fail to see anythingvery objectionable in them, for as far as I have been permittedto judge, they are mostly comic in nature. The waste of time andneglect of important work probably is the greatest objectionto them, however, they are going the way of all Indian customs.The younger generations are drifting away from the customs, whichmeans that the ceremonies are disappearing with the older people.I believe that an authentic photographic record of the SnakeDance, and other ceremonies, should be made by the SmithsonianInstitute in order that the costumes, utensils, implements andall occupations could be shown tin use by the Indians. I believeafter this is done th at reputable Moving Picture Companies shouldbe allowed to make records of the Dances under supervision ofthe Government, in order that the general public may have acorrect knowledge of what only a few thousand people who canafford the expense of a trip to the reservation see. This meanscommercializing the Dances, and that means the end of the ceremonies.Whenever the public has been let in, a sure and constant systemof Whitman's inovations and change s take place in the originalceremonies that eventually eliminate the Indian features to suchan extent the objectional ceremonies die a natural death. I amconvinced of this from thirty years of daily touch and observation.The Missionaries, and many others will not agree with this,but I believe people who have made a scientific study of theIndians and his customs will admit it.
