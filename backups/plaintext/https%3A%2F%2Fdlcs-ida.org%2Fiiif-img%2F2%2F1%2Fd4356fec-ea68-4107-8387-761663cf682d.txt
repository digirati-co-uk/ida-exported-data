I consider it an outrage an on an employe and adisgrace to our Government for people to be asked to stay insuch dilapidated and filthy quarters. This tribe has ample fungInrenkite gupport and I have recommended the construction ofnew agency and school plant.2. The force of agency empl√∏yes is sufficient for present needs,except another stockman is needed.3.These Indians lived here for a number of years without anagency and apparently have never known what restraint ordiscipline meant. They are very peacable so long as they havetheir own way, are issued rations, paid per capita paymentsand allowed to live in idleness and debauchery, but upon theslightest effort to establish law or order they virtually goon the warpath. Upon taking charge of this agency over a yearago I found these Indians virtually defieing the state ofColorado and the Indian Office and refusing to surrender oneof their number who had shot a Mexican. After much difficultyand some threat of using force this Indian was induced tosurrender. He was finally tried in the state districy courtand given a light sentence. Another Indian was sent to jail atDenver for three months. These apprehensions, together with anincreased police forse and the supplying of plenty of workfor all able bodied Indians have had a good effect.These Indians indulge in dances, but apparently they are ofthe more harmless sort and no especial damage is done by them.5. Practiaally all marriages are by Indian custom.5a.State laws are not complied with.5b. No steps have been taken to enforce state laws as the stateexercises no jurisdiction here, A few Indians have securedlicense and been married at the agency.
