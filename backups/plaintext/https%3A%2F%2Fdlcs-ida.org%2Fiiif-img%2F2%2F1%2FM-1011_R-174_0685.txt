Section 1--....... INDUSTRIES.
For the advancement of the Indians industrially
our program is: Do a 11ttle more than last year. Do
it better. Get better returns. Improve the grade of the
farm products. Also improve the grade of the livestock.
This is not merely an ideal. It is a policy in force and
a working policy.

ment over previous years.

The past seasons operations have been more Buc
cessful that for several years past. More and better
wheat has been grown. Over 100, 000 lbs of wheat has
been ground into an excellent grade of Å¿lour in the
agency reimbur sable flour mi11. The corn harevet has been
good. Good prices have been secured for farm produce
sold, also good prices have been secured for the Wool

have been introduced, Several Indians have purchased
and planted some fruit trees, in a small way.

Crops were not affected to any noticable ex
tent by insists, excepting the bean erop. The bean
crop was practically a total failure, due to an insect
eating the vines. No remedy has been employed.
The insect Bapped the Juice from the leaves and vine s
rather than eat the vine 8.
Approximately one- half of the crop was consumed.
One- fourth was sold under favorable market conditions.
One- fourth was held in re serve for planting and future
Use. Untti More progressive methods of harvesting
have been acquired, we have about reached the peak of
production. The Indians have difficulty in harvesting
what they raise now.
