Dear Sir,
Please send 25,000 pounds of flour on your contract dated
May 17,1898,
our supply will last about three weeks, and it will be necessary
to have it delivered here by that time.
I can arrange to have it hauled to the school by the Indians, and
viz,
the charge will be the same as freighters in Sante Pe would ask,
ree cents per hundred pounds.
Very respectfully,
Superintendent.
