Nescalero School,

.
the school justifies, but the cost paid in salaries to maintain the
school as now charged exceeds$ 70.00 per pupil per year.
The reason
for this excess arises from two reasons, one that they have not a suf
ficient number of pupils; the other that the superintendent
who re
ceives$ 1600.00 per the year, the clerk's salary of$ 900.00 per year,
and the$ 600.00 salary paid the black Smith, making a total of$ 3100 per
yoar, all of which is charged to the school,
the superintendent is not
only superintendent of the school, but also acts as agent which takes
about one half of his time.
The clerk and the black smith devote at
least one half of their time to agency affairs; that being the case, it
would seem as though one half of the salaries of the above named em
ployes should be charged to the agency.
if this were done, the salary
list would not with the usual number of pupils exceed$ 70.00 per pu
pil per year.
I think the conduct of all the employes is such as to encour
age parents to send their children and pupils to attend the school.
Below please find the names of the persons employed at this
school, the position occupied, and the salary received by each.
