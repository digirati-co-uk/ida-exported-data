DinnArbPECTIVEORIGINALna NDIAANNUAL REPORT OF CARSON INDIAN SCHOOL?/Jutro,STEWART, NEVADA.1920.4000As time passes and the white people of Nevada see and Tuernmore of the native population, a more brotherly feeling is broughtabout on both sides. The public schools in some sections of thestate do not hesitate to receive Indian children. In 90 me localities the school authorities still will not receive Indian pupilsin the public school. Carson City High School had six Indian pupils in attendance during the entire school year which has justclosed, and the principal of the school states that they are doinggood work and are holding their own with their white classmates.There will be three or four mo re Indian girls and boys to enter thehigh school this fall.The State superintendent of public schools of Nevada is heartily in favor of having Indian children attend the public schoolsof the State and is in every way cooperating with the governmentofficials in creating, a favorable sentiment toward this end.There are a number of Indian children living on reservationsin the State who when they have completed the course at the dayschools have no other place to continue their education except atthe Cars on Indian School. The Washoe Indians living in the vicinity of Gardnerville, about fifteen miles from the school, are notreceived in the public schools, and as this school was filled toits capacity during the year, no special efforts were made to getall the boys and girls of school age into school. The capacity ofthe school having just been increased by fifty, an effort will bemade to have all who should be in school come in at the opening ofthe school in September. Last year the State Legislature passeda lav making it compulsory for all Indian children of school ageto attend either an Indian School or a public school.The greatest need of the school at present is a new diningroom and kitchen and a boiler house properly equipped to run thelaundry and furnish steam for the kitchen and heat for some of thelarger buildings.A complete new sewer system including a large septic tank hasjust been installed, and the re will be no further objections on thepart of the State of Nevada in regard to the disposal of the sewage,which he retofore has been turned into an open stream from whichthe Prison Farm has been getting its irrigation supply.Improvements and extensions to the irrigation system have justbeen made, and in normal seasons there is a sufficient supply ofwater for irrigating about one hundred acres of the school farm.H
