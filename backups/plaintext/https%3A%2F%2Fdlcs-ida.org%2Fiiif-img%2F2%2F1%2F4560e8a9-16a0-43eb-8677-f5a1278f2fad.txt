There have been no epidemios andno serious sioloss. All ailments and siokmess have been treatedand cared for by the physician at the school hospital. Duringthe last half of the year, owing to the fact that the officecould not fill the position of nurse at the low salary of$ 600per annum, the hospital has been in charge of an Indian AssistantMatron who receives$ 300 per annum.The physician attends 2, 000 Indians who reside in three places14, 30, 40 miles respectively from the school and it would seemnecessary to have a compe tant nurse in charge of the hospitalwhen the physician has to be absent so much.
