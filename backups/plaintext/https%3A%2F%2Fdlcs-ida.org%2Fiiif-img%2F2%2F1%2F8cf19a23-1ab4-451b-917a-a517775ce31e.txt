weather, which is often 10 to 15 degrees below
zero these houses
were very cold and as wood is scarce they preferred the houses
on the mesas, which are built close together and the rooms of
which are very small and warm, notwithstanding their exposed con
dition on the top of the mesa.
It must beltaken into consider
ation that their clothing is generally very light and the chil
dren below 10 or 12 years of age, during the coldest weather are
entirely nude.
The Government undertook to remedy this matter
by furnishing cotton duck for ceilings.
A very short time subse
quent the women appeared with new white cotton duck leggins and
the men with new white cotton duck pants.
The party that recom
mended this duck did not know the character of an Indian.
They
should have been built with one sloping roof of adobe, which ispery
warm and serves their purpose fully.
There are now a large num
ber, about 40 of these buildings at the First Mesa and a large
number at other places, I do not know how many, but before they
become popular this change will have to be made.
A short time ago the Government issued to these Moquis
carbon oil lamps without making any provisions for oil.
He has
no means oglio obtaining
oil and I did not see one in use, but I un
derstand
they are selling them as fast as they can realize on
them.
In mentioning
these matters I mean no reflection
what
ever on the Indian Bureau, for they have simply been misled in
these matters by the statements
of parties who are impractical
theorists
, or were unaware of the condition
of affairs.
