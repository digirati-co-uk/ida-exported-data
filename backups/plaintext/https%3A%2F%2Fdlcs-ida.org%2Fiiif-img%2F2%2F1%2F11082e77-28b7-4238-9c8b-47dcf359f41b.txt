Seeing the World inDifferent ShadesI see the world in different shades.Shades of seasons — fall, winter,spring, and summer. Our world revolves around our ceremonies. Eachseason is commemorated by rituals ofprayer, song and dance. These ceremonies play an important part inour different beliefs and traditions.These traditions are passed fromgeneration to generation by each whoparticipates. Many of the young learnat an early age and become teachersfor the newer generation, thus continuing life' s unending cycle.Different shades and colors of lifeadd significance to our daily existence. Mother Earth puts color in ourworld through the blue sky, the redearth, the green trees, the majesticpurple sunsets, the yellow sunflowers, and the crystal clear waterwhich gives life to all creation. By ourcoexistence with other living beingslike — rocks, trees, insects, animals,and plants, we continue to survive.Each one has a part to play in maintaining the fragile harmonious balance and together the rhythm of ourlives continue to fullfill one destiny.— Mariam ToyaFlorena WoodyVirg
