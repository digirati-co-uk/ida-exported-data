During part of this growingseason, high winds prevail, which are detrimental to growing plants,especially young plants, the winds occurring in the early part ofthe season. Nearly all of the Indians cultivate small pieces ofground, but the most of these are not larger than a garden plot.The areas cultivated by the Indians range from one acre to eightand ten acres.There are probably 100 Indian families thatcultivate these larger areas.I think that the cultivated areasha ve declined to a small extent during the past year, on accountof the climatie conditions. Without irrigation there is greatuncertainty here as to getting crops at all.The only crops thatcan be raised without additional irrigation are on small tracts ofSchool irrigated ground, of which there is very little.There isno irrigation on the reservation.The principal crops are corn, pumpkins and melons, nearly all ofwhich are used by the Indians for subsistence.The market conditionsare good and all of the produce raised can be disposed of at a goodprice.The principal problem presented by these Indians is todevelop water for irrigation purposes.All of the Indians on the reservation are engaged in stockraising.All ha ve sheep and about one half of the families have cattle.They own between 40, 000 and 45, 000 head of sheep and goats, andabout 6, 000 head of cattle.The stock is pretty well distributed
