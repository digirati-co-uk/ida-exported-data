Early last spring itwas soon that grass- hopperswould do great damageto thenew alfalfa, also the wheat and other crops, 1f strenuousmeasures were not taken to get rid of them. It was veryapparent that it would be a waste of money and time toput out the new alfalfa, unless some thing could be doneto check the ravages of the grass- hoppers.I directed the farmer to take this matter up withthe govOrnor and council, with the request that the councilmake it a community duty to clean the banks of the ditchesand fence lines around the Tio lds of the rank growth ofweeds and undergrowth in which the grass- hoppers are bred,I directed that he tell the council if this were done, wewould institute a poison campaign by spreading bran soakedin arsenic, which would be a check in killing of the grasshoppers, which infested the immediate vicinity of their1iolds.. The Indians were of the opinion that the poisonthus distributed would not be effective, and were inclinedto laugh at the whole suggestion. They lot the matter dragfor a week or ten days without taking any action in carryingout the work in cleaning up the ditches and Tields by thepueblo as directed,Upon being informed of this, I directord the farmerto call another council and inform the Indians that, unlossthis work of cleaning the Tields and ditches of the weedswhere the gras 8- hoppers wore bred, was carried out at onceby the pueblo, no alfalfa seed would be issued or planted,I folt that, unless the Indians took Suficient interest inthe success of prospective alfalfa crops to do this work,which th ey were able to do and it was manifestly apparentshould be done, it would be most unwise to plant the seedin viow of its parly dostructionby the gras 8- hoppors. Whenthe Indians understood that no seed would be planted untilthey had performedtheir part in the campaign against thegrass- hoppors, they did as requested. The poison was thendistributed by the farmer and resulted in a lossoning ofthe number of grass- hoppers in the immediate vicinity ofthe, permitted the to grow withhieldsand crops sown upvory little damago.
