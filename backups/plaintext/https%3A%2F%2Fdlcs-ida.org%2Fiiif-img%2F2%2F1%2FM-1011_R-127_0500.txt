Annual ReportIndustries- 3Santa FeThere is urgent need for the purchase and installation ofthese threshing outfits at the pueblos, both from the instructive and economic benefits to be deri ved fron their use by theIndians.The present ne thod of harvesting, like many of the farmingmethods of the Indians, is most primitive, and consists of thewheat and grain being spread on the threshing floor and threshedby horses, or sheep or goats, being drivenround and round theenclosure for hours at a time.

This is a decided econonmic loss in that the horses c on.sume grazing which could be used to advantage for cattle and stockof real use and market value.Both the portable and tracti on engines necessary for thethreshing outfits can be used to decided advantage at other periods of the year for the many purposes to which power can be putin the pueblo, such as saving wood and baling hayI feel very Btrongly the need of threshing facilities in thepueblos, which will include the necessary purchase of at least onereaper and binder for use in connection with the power thresher,and will set forth in separate recommendation the needs in thisrespectIn connection with the promotion of farming industries, arecommendation will be submitted requesting that additional farnersbe assigned to the pueblos where those positions are not alreadyestablished.
