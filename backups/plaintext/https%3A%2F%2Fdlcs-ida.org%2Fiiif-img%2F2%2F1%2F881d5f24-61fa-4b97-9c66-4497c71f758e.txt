There lived at thatplace a man and his wife who had an only daughter.It was the custom for all the boys of the different families to goout on certain days in winter to kill rabbits. One day the girl toldher parents that she was going rabbit hunting. She said, “ I am onlya girl, but I believe I can kill as many rabbits as any of the boys."She started on the rabbit hunt and succeeded in killing a numberof rabbits. Getting tired, she stopped in a cave on the north side ofthe small mountain about three miles southwest of Laguna, to restand to cook a rabbit for her dinner. About that time an old giantessappeared on the scene, attracted by the scent of the roasting rabbit,and spoke to the girl. She was very much frightened at the hugebeing. The giantess was as big as a mountain. Her mouth was several yards wide. She told the girl that she was also hunting but hadnot succeeded in catching any game. She asked the girl for a rabbit.The girl threw her a rabbit which she swallowed at one gulp, thencalled for another, and another, and another, until they were all gone.The giantess then told the girl that she wanted more. The girl tookher clothes, one garment at a time, and threw them to the giantess.The giantess then said that she was going to eat the girl.The cave that the girl was in was so small that the giantess couldget neither her hand nor her head into it.The girl began to scream and cry. The two brave brothers whowere in the mountains east of the Rio Grande, heard her crying andsaid to each other, “ Listen! I hear some one of our people crying;let us go and see what the trouble is. ”They started and soon arrived at the place and found the oldgiant woman pounding on the opening of the cave with a large stone,making marks which are still to be seen on the stone.She spoke to them, saying, “ My grandsons, what are you doing? ”“ Oh, we are hunting rabbits," they replied.“ What nice spears you have, and what sharp points."“ Yes, ” said the brothers, “ you can see them better if you standup and turn your head a little to one side. ”As she was about to stand up they threw their spears and eachstruck her in the neck and killed her. They then cut her open andtook out the girl' s clothes and returned them to her. They then cutoff the giantess' head and threw it over to the southwest, where it nowlies, turned to stone. This stone is now known as the giant' s face.The brothers threw the heart to the north, and it stands in theshape of a hill northeast of Laguna, on the road to Paquate. Thathill is know as “ Giant' s Heart."After throwing the parts of the body, the brothers went out andkilled a great number of rabbits for the girl, then took her home.WElllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll!!!-iilllllllllllllllllllllllllll-Hillllllllllllllllllllllll|||llllllllllH$ 11||||||||illl|||||||||||| 1||- Alfil ——|-| ll|| l1-111111111111illlllllllll||||-||-Page Forty
