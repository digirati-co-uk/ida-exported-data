Der MÃ©demme:
In reply to your letter of the 26th instant concerning
the purchase of wood for use of your school, would inform you that
I think is best to make the purchase of the whole Io cords this
quarter,
Unless the Wood is purchased and taken up this quart er, 11 Cannet
be expended, hence your expenditure for the next quarter might seem
to be 67tvfsi ve.
You should arrange with some of the Indians to have the whole
amount delivered so on. Please inform me at the earliest possible
date of the auno unt received from each Indian and the price per cord,
and oblige.
very respectrully,
jikkonsent.
