much of the worknincluded in this curriculum con be a series ofexperiences to put across good ideas the sequence of which was plannedby the teacher instead of integrated or correlated experiences leading from each other thru the work carried on by the children.ASthe curriculum now stands the children need not always be ready forthe experiences which are given them. These children must be lead,but more value is obtained if each successive experience activityis a part of and grows out of those activities completed.MissMcMillan's suggestion that the curriculum might be more helpful ifall the objectives were stated in terms of activities and the listof activities as such omitted.It would then be easier to carryout the work in a more unified manner. Instead of suggesting activities, it might be more valuable to list units of work appropriatefor the various progress levels and include a comprehensive patternor an actual copy of some units of work.The past year's work has revealed that most of the activitieslisted in the curriculum for Progress Level 3 are appropriate for thematurity of those children and enter naturally into units or" NavajoHome Life" and" Our School."Those activities referring to demonstrations on health should be omitted and the objectives stated in sucha manner as to deal with specific cases.If most of the group failto meet the requirements, have a class discussion, but usually,younger children react more readily i≈ø dealt with as individuals.Home sanitation should be approached thru dramatic play or individualdrawings with young children. All the activities included under" Home Membership" will enter naturally into a unit on" Navajo HomeLife" or" The Navajo family", consequently they need not be listed
