much of the worknincluded in this curriculum con be a series of
experiences to put across good ideas the sequence of which was planned
by the teacher instead of integrated or correlated experiences lead
ing from each other thru the work carried on by the children.
AS
the curriculum now stands the children need not always be ready for
the experiences which are given them. These children must be lead,
but more value is obtained if each successive experience activity
is a part of and grows out of those activities completed.
Miss
McMillan's suggestion that the curriculum might be more helpful if
all the objectives were stated in terms of activities and the list
of activities as such omitted.
It would then be easier to carry
out the work in a more unified manner. Instead of suggesting activi
ties, it might be more valuable to list units of work appropriate
for the various progress levels and include a comprehensive pattern
or an actual copy of some units of work.
The past year's work has revealed that most of the activities
listed in the curriculum for Progress Level 3 are appropriate for the
maturity of those children and enter naturally into units or" Navajo
Home Life" and" Our School."
Those activities referring to demonstra
tions on health should be omitted and the objectives stated in such
a manner as to deal with specific cases.
If most of the group fail
to meet the requirements, have a class discussion, but usually,
younger children react more readily i≈ø dealt with as individuals.
Home sanitation should be approached thru dramatic play or individual
drawings with young children. All the activities included under
" Home Membership" will enter naturally into a unit on" Navajo Home
Life" or" The Navajo family", consequently they need not be listed
