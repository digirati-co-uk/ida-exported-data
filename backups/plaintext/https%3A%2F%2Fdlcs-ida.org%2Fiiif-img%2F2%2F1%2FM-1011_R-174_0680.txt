The general health condition at the schools and
agonoy is very satisfactory. It is exceptionally good.
An epidemic of whooping cough broke out on the
reservation in July, 1924, which took a heary to11.
The epidemic lasted through July, to October, inclusive.
Due to the Indian manner of living, and the fact that many
would not follow orders of the physician, the infant
mortality was quite heavy.
General sanitary conditions in and about the Indian
homes are showing gradual improvement. There is consid
erable room for further improvement but prospects are
encouraging.
During the year regular sanitary inspections
have been held. Alo Dr. Stevens has made a care
ful inspection for disease and sanitary conditions.
( b)
Suitable living and working quarters are needed
for the physician and the field matron. The field
matron should have a good education in practical
home nursing.
Two house- to- house inspections have been recent
ly made by representatives of the Office, with es
pecial observation for tuberculosis and trachoma.
This was followed up by a clinic for trachoma by
Dr. Perkins. Practically only about a half- dozen
children are found tosineligible for entollment in
school account of poor health.
( a)
The establishment of tent hospitals at this
reservatton is not considered necessary, for the
instruction of children ineligible for school,
or for others.
We have a small hospital at the agency. Ito
general use is meeting$ considerable opposition
among the older Indians. For this reason its max
imum usefullness is not secured. It will take
considerable time to educate the Indians out of
the sentiment of opposition.
( a) Very few venertal diseases are observed among
the Zunis.
( b) The physician is called upon to treat an oc
- Casional case.
( o). We have formed no special plans against the se
diseases.
