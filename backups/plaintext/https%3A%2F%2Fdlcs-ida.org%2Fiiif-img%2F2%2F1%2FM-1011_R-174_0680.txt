SECTION II-- HEALTH,i.( a)( e)The general health condition at the schools andagonoy is very satisfactory. It is exceptionally good.An epidemic of whooping cough broke out on thereservation in July, 1924, which took a heary to11.The epidemic lasted through July, to October, inclusive.Due to the Indian manner of living, and the fact that manywould not follow orders of the physician, the infantmortality was quite heavy.General sanitary conditions in and about the Indianhomes are showing gradual improvement. There is considerable room for further improvement but prospects areencouraging.During the year regular sanitary inspectionshave been held. Alo Dr. Stevens has made a careful inspection for disease and sanitary conditions.( b)Suitable living and working quarters are neededfor the physician and the field matron. The fieldmatron should have a good education in practicalhome nursing.Two house- to- house inspections have been recently made by representatives of the Office, with especial observation for tuberculosis and trachoma.This was followed up by a clinic for trachoma byDr. Perkins. Practically only about a half- dozenchildren are found tosineligible for entollment inschool account of poor health.( a)The establishment of tent hospitals at thisreservatton is not considered necessary, for theinstruction of children ineligible for school,or for others.We have a small hospital at the agency. Itogeneral use is meeting$ considerable oppositionamong the older Indians. For this reason its maximum usefullness is not secured. It will takeconsiderable time to educate the Indians out ofthe sentiment of opposition.( a) Very few venertal diseases are observed amongthe Zunis.( b) The physician is called upon to treat an oc- Casional case.( o). We have formed no special plans against the sediseases.- 4.( e)
