Santa Fe, 1.1., July 28, 1924.The Field lease, on the Beautifulyou ta in structure,has been assignedto the Havajo Company, and, after anextensionuntil July 15th,& well with a fully equippedstandard rig was spuddedin on that da te.There hasbeen a good deal of delay and negotiationabout thislease, as I was certain would be the case when the bidwas accepted, but it is now in good hands and I am confident that a thorough test will be made at the presentlocationby competentdrillers. The location was approvedby Mr. Nowels and various geologists, and is probablywellcho sen. The operationis an importantone, as thediscoveryof oil there in the shina rump or the nextunderlyinghorizonswould be of great significanceandpossiblyadd much value to some neighboringterritory.As to the Hogback structure, the Midwest RefiningCompany has been very slow in developingtheir leasethere, which was approvedNovember4, 1921, nearlythreeyearsago. What they have taken over two andone- half years to do, could very easily have been donein four months. The actual proven area in the Dakotasis less than 300 acres, and they do not proposeto proveany larger ares, even if it is there, because the oilunder hydrostaticpressure can, they believe, all beeasily produced and the pool exhaustedfrom the presentwells. They have dallied along with the developmentofthis lease, first becausethey once hoped to secureleases on the whole reservation, under an interpretationof the regulationsregardingthe leasing of tribal landsthat the 4800 acre limitationto one lessee was merelydirectory and not mandatoryon the Secretary( an interpretationwhich the former solicitorof the Departmentapparently maintained); and secondly, because after theSanta Fe sale they wished to find out what the otherstructuresdevelopedbefore deciding what was best todo with their own oil. However, since none of the otherstructures( except the Rattlesnake) have as yet developed anything but water, they have now determinedtobuild a pipe line to Farmingtonfor the disposal of asmuch of their oil as they can find a market for. Inthis connectionI may say that there was up to recentlyconsiderabledi scussion by the off ie ia ls of the MidwestCompany as to the advisabilityof putting in a smallrefineryat Farming ton, and some months ago Wr.
