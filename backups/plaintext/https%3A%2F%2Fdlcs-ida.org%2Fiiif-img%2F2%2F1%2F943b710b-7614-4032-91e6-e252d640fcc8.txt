recommended by Inspector Lane, at least not until the existing one
shall have been fairly testod.
I may add that Major Williams is now in the city and that.
an informal conference has been hed with him in regard to the plan,
as above sot I orth.
He endorse this plan and states that he has
estimated for two additional tarmers for the coming fiscal year, one
is to be sta ti oned in each of the districts in which irrigation
Tork is not going on.
There are two districts
, namely, the Chinli
and Blaok Creek Valleys.
If this plan can be consummatod
, Major
Williams
is of the opinion
that it will be successful
.
With these remarks I return herewith
the Inspector's
report.
Very respectfully
