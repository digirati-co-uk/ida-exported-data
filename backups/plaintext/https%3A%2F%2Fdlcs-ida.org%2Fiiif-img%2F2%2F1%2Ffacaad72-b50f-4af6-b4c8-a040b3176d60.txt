NARRATIVE
Annual Report, 1913
Section II Health
Each successive year shows a gein in getting
the confidence of the Indians, more and better equip
ment in the school, and sanitary improvements in build
ings and on grounds. The fiscal year 1913 shows a
distinct gain in all these matters, o ver preceding
years.
More could have been accomplised with the camp
each did all he could. An epidemic of any kind
carries off a considerable number.
The most urgent needs for carrying on the
medical or health work on the reservation, are-
( 1) Four frame buildings to be erected back of
the school hospital for contagious cases or
for outside Indians in the last stages of
tuberculosis, cancer, etc.
( 2) More physicians. Better pay. At the
present time, tied down by their respective
schools, physicians have little or no time
to visit camps or otherwise gain a practice
among reservation Indians. The Physicians
are under paid. I sincerely hope the plan
of reorganization effecting pay of Physicians
will be provided for during the coming fiscal
year.
