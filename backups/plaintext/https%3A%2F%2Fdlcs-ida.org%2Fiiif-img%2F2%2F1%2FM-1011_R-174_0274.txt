-- SCHOOLS
Feeling between public schools and Indian Schools
in this vicinity is friendly
School privileges are within reach of about two
thirds of the Indian children of this jurisdiction. For
the balance, there exists no school accomodations. A
small public school in rented quarters has recently been
organizda at the Zuni pueblo, having an attendance of about
a dozen pupils
Industrial training is given the boys and girls
as nearly in conformity with the Indian school course of
study as conditions will pernit. Due to the large number
of temporary employees the industrial training is not
getting as good results as could be desired
Both boarding and day schools are in great need
of more buildings, as follows:
For day school, a building for use as a laundry,
bath, toilet, and work rooms for the girls in sewing,
mending, etc. This school has an attendance of 150 pupils
and the only accomodation provided for the purpose indi
cated above, is a small one roon adobe building furnished
with one old bath tub and a few galvanized tubs.
