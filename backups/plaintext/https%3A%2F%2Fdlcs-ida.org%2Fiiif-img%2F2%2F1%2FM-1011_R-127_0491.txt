Annual ReportSanta FeNARRATIVESection IIISchoolsDayThe day schools form a most important factor in the edu.cation of the Indian. Special efforts will be made during thecoming year that the enrollment in the day schools shall consistof children from school age up to not exceed ten yearsageIt is believed that much better results can be secured in thisway, through having the older children attend the boarding schoolIn this way the children in attendance at the day schools will beof a more uniform age and grade, which will simplify and con.centrate the work of the school.Much difficulty is experienced in securing anything like aregular attendance of the children enrolled at the day schoolsAlthough in one instance, in the Albuquerque district, I believethe provisions of the state law for compulsory education wereapplied to the Indians, this was accomplished through the aid ofa friendly white justice of the peace. I believe there is somequestion as to whether this law can be enforced with respect tothe Indians, and I am of the opinion that it would be almosthope less to attempt it where the cases would have to be broughtbefore Mexican justices of the peace, who are uniformly ignorantand unqualified, and who would not be inclined to support theefforts of the government in this respect. It is proposed, itIndian police are established in the several pueblos as recommended,to enforce compulsory attendance of children of school age at theday schools, through the policeIn order to have satisfactory progress in school work at theday schools, as in any other school, there must be regular attendance The inclination of the Indians is not to consider theattendance of the ir children at school as of serious importance,and to allow them to stay out of school on most any pretext,as well as to take them out for work which could be done by othermembers of the family. In my opinion the parents should apply tothe teacher in person for permission to keep their children out ofschool, and then where there was any good reason for such actionthe teacher could grant such permission. The police should reporteach morning to the teacher and by visiting the hones of Indianswhose children were absent without permission, enforce the attendance of such children by bringing them to school. Only in thisway can satisfactoryresultsbe obtainedin day school workRepeate awareness consumes
