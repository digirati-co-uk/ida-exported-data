“ There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. Whenwe are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, weopen to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, andacceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all ourglory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, wecannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potentialto create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in thefearlessness and open- hearted vision of people who embracelife. ”- John Lennon.
