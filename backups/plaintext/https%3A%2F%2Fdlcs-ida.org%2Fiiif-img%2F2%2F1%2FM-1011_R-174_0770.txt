ANNUAL REPORT, 1927.- ZUNI AGENCY, NEW MEXICO.
NARRATIVE.
POPULATION
The Zuni Indians have a governing body of officials, consist
ing of a Governor, Lieutenant governor and six Tienantes, chosen
by the high priests, who attend to law and order, to settling of
estates and to the partitioning of the irrigatable lands among the
individual Indians. These officers are quite reliable and are of
average intelligence. They are of help to the superintendent and
I am heartily in favor of not only continuing their services but
I am of the opinion that their powers should be extended. While
these officers can punish offenders, because of the fact that there
is no manner by which obedience to their commands can be enforced
except through the superintendent, if it were understood that a
sentence imposed would be carried out, the same to be reviewed and
approved by the superintendent, greater assistance could be render
ed by these officials. Under the present system, any decision or
settlement made by the officials may be reviewed by the superintend
ent if this settlement is not satisfactory to the Indians, the
officers naturally would prefer for their decisions to stand be
cause of the effect upon the Indians of having this reviewed by
the superintendent and there is too much endeavor to please the
individual in making these settlements. By increasing their powers
and making it necessary for their decisions to be approved in every
case, such change would no doubt be of benefit.
As there are no trust funds belonging to the Zuni tribe, no
annuities or other payments have ever been made to these Indians.
