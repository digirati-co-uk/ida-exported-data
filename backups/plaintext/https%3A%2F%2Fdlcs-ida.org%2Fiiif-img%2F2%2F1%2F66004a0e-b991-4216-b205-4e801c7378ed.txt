Northern Pueblos Agency,Santa Fe, N. N.SECTION IIISCHOOLS1. There is no particular relationship between the publicschools and the Indian schools at this agency.2. There are no public school facilities within reach ofIndian pupile, excepting at San Ildefonso where there is& Spanish American or Mexican school, and the Indiansobject to mixing with these natives.3.( a) The day schools at this agency are fairly wellequipped and kept in a good state of repair.Ina gmch as Taos is our largest day school,carries the sixth grade and has an enrollmentof 179, it may be considered the most important. I am at the present time buildingan addition to the domestic science buildingand a garage for employees. Teos should havea shop building, a small marse's cottage, andan additional fuel or coal room. It shouldalso have a Delco lighting system. Picurisshould also have an addition built to it.( b) Taos is the only day school that has anythinglike a school farn or garden.( c) The corps of employees at the day schools arepractically sufficient, with a few elightchanges.4.The day schools have no graduates.5. There are no Indian schools directly under the superinteadent at this agency.St. Catherines Indian School islocated in Santa fe and has something like 300 or morechildren: is doing excellent work. The only contributionthe Government is making to this school is the employment ofa physician, Dr. I. 1. Fiske.6. The morality of the Indians in my jurisdiction willcompare favorably with that of the population of the State:they can hardly be classed as a whole as progressive.Santo Domingo 18 perhaps the most backward and clings o.loserto the old customs.7.Pupils.( a) Practically all of the Indian children in thisdistrict are in school, except possibly a fewat Santo Domingo, but these apparently are moreor less defective.
