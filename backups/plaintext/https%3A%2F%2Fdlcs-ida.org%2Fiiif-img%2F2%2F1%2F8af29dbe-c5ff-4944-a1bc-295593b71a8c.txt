CLASS POEMâ€œ Onward to Victory"QUOISMarch on, Seniors, not like a lagard stayMarch swiftly on, as thou seekest thy motto to obey.Keep thy feet where all the nobly wise of old have trod,The path of faith, made by the sons of God.SONSLet the white carnation ever be a symbol to thee,Of steadfastness of purpose and of purity.Pledge yourselves, seventy- one lads and lassesTo give A. I. S. cause to remember you as one of her noblest classes.Something to learn and something to forget,Hold fast to the good, and seek the better yet.Fight on, and make proud the instructors of your youth,Prove that Creeds are but milestones on the road to Truth.- WAYNE DAILYIAHENVERZ0 1937 VOVAPage Thirty- eight
