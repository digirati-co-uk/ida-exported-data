seasons, when it is all resold to Nava jos, The Nava jos always save
their own seed, which is not tested before planting.
The equipment used by the Nava jos in their farm operations would
not be called" suitable" by many farmers, yet all they lack in equip
ment they make up in zeal. Their methods of farming are crude, yet
they get results and that is the desired objective. The water is di
verted from the arroyos and washes in the spring and caused to run
on their fields as long as it will continue to flow. When it ceases
to flow, the ground is plowed. The plowing done by them with their
little pony teams and ten- inch plows constitutes what a good white
farmer would term a mere hoeing, but it answers the purpose. The com
and melons are planted and if the rains come in July, the crop is made.
If the rains fail to come in July and occasionally they do fail, the
orop fails also. A few of them have little patches of alfalfa and this
number is increasing from year to year.
The only live stock purchased for these people has here to fore con
sisted of pure bred rams. This year pure bred Angora bucks were added
to the list. This stock is always cared for to the very best of their
knowledge and ability. If the corn crop has been good, most of them.
grain their male animals a little during the winter months.
During the spring of 1926, these Indians solà 573, 717 pounds of
wool. My report for the year 1924, Page 50A, shows the income of the
Nava jos for that year. Ten thousand seven hundred twenty- five wether
lambs brought$ 48, 117; 307, 185 pounds of wool brought$ 76, 687. 91.
The total income for that year for the Northern Navajo Jurisdiction
was$ 369, 337. 61. In 1926, they sold 28, 603 wether lambs for$ 173, 048. 15,
573, 717 pounds of wool for$ 157, 772. 17, and their total income for the
year was$ 682, 006. 32. The data in each instance was obtained from the
same source, viz., the records of the licensed trader. The figures on
the wool clip for 1927 have not as yet been secured. However, we do
know that the 1927 clip is considerably heavier than the 1926 clip.
This increase is in great measure due to the introduction each year of
pure bred rams. There has been little increase in the number of sheep
owned. The conditions of the range prohibit this. The increase is
due almost entirely to improved stock. The limit has not yet been
reached. Possibly ten to fifteen per cent of their breeding stock is
as yet unimproved.

There is another source of possible income that has long been
overlooked, namely, the goats. Almost every lava jo runs a few goats
with his sheep herd. These goats supply him with a small amount of
milk and in addition to this with 21 esh for human consumption. Last
fall fifty- one head of pure breà Angora bucks were puro nased and sola
to Indians on the reimbursable plan. It was just an experiment. No
one knew in advance how the Navajos would take to the plan, It proved
highly successful. Two hundred bucks would not have supplied the
demand. We expect to continue this work until Mohair ranks as one of
their chief sources of income.
