e havo a very definite program of industrial ad
vancement and this program has not varied uch since we
received our first impressions of the Navajo de seat. The
Annual Report for 1924 ior this jurisdiction reads in part
as follows:
We have a very definite program of in
dustrial advancement,
( a) We
propose to operate a saw
- mill and
operate it in such& InEnner that lumber may
be procured by all. needing it with no expense
to the consumer other than expense of labor
This will enable the Navajo, if they wish,
to get away from the much condemned type of
dwelling which they now occupy,- the Hogan.
It will enable then to substitute wooden
structures for sand and brush structures in
their little privately owned irrigation
ditches
( b) He propose to make it possible for
them to conserve in reservoirs some of the
flood waters so that they may have water for
irrigation purposes even after the spring
flood waters have subsided.
As it is to-. y, and as it always has
been, 90% of the privately owned ditches to
tally lack water as soon as the snows have
disappeared from the hills. As yet we have
no me ans of knowing how many reservoirs of
this character may be built but we are cer
tain that several at least are capable of con
struction. When this work is once undertaken
it
may develop that possible reservoir sites
are numerous,
( c) We propose to develop every spring
and every seep on the jurisdiction to its
capacity and, when this is done, We propose
to construct reservoirs( surface tanks) to
impound flood water and melting snow and rain
for stock purposes. When this is done we pro
pose to drill wells in all such areas as are
still lacking stock- water,
Our ideas have changed but little since we first viewed
