in school.We have had no incorrigible children during the year.Returned students generally are busy out on the reservation andother places. Several are employed at the agency and in the institutions.Employees have been efficient and loyal and have cooperatedfully for the benefit of the patients enrolled.Public school authorities have shown a decided willingness tocooperate with this office.These Indians are opposed to the intermingling of races and onlyone marriage is of record outside the race.This is an Apache man whois married to a Mexican woman.Systematic supervision is given the children both in the playroom and on the playground. However much of the instruction and entertainment must be provided in the dormitories where the childrenare most of the day.No land has been sold and none of the reservation opened up tosettlement which precludes the establishment of public schools bythe state.This condition will likely prevail for many years, makingGovernment schools necessary for the education of these children.
