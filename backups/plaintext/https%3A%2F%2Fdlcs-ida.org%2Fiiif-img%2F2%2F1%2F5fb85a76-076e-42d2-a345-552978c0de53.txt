Santa Fe, New Mexico, November 2, 1899.
Hon, commissioner of Indian Artens,
Washington, D. C.
Sir:
I have the honor to request that your Orries purchase, and have
sent to this school at an early hate, 100 tunes Qyeerinised Vaccine.
A large number of pupils have been enrolled who have never been
vaccinated, and
believe in this section special attention should
be
paid to this matter.
All during lagt hinter there were cases
of Small pox on all sides of the school, txt ny beans careful we escaped
it.
W. S. Harroun, the school physician states that the vaccine points
usually furnished aru mor satast'actory, and requests that glycerinized
vaccine be furnished this alycerinusud vaccine is far more offective,
and rarely makes the era sore, while the vaccine in other forms very
often makes the arm so sore that all work or study must be postponed
for sometamus month.
Very respectfully,
Your obedient servant.
superintendens
