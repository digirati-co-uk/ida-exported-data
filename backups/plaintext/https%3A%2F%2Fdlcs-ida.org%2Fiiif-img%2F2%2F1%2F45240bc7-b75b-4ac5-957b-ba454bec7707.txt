101To illustrate:have never had an opportunity at any sort of education.an uneducated, non- English- speaking Navajo parent of 40 years of age isquite likely to havo four descendants.These will be the eldestchild aged about 20, the second aged about 16, the third aged about 12,the fourth aged about 8.It is believed that a good average is six forthe Navajo family, that is, father, mother and four children.Consider that the first generation of children( the one aged 20) 18beyond school age and may not be reached. Accepting that Navajos willlive to an average old age of 65, the U. S. Government has thisHe willgentleman upon its hands for 45 years hence- or until 1961.be uneducated, reactionary, and a barbarian.Accepting the possibility that the other three generations may be promptly reached, it iseasy to figure that Governmental schools must be maintained for manyears to even catch up with the present crop of children--- thosealready living; and the descendants will present the same necessity foreducational advantages.Therefore Governmental protection and jurisdiction would seemabsolutely necessary for the uneducated until 1961 at least; and whenit is recalled that there are at hand facilities for not more than25% of the Navajo children of school age now living, the problem inpoint of preparing facilities for the need actually faced becomes anexpansive one.21
