school wort, on which prises are offered. We also send a display of school
othibits and blakt weaving to the Santa To Fiesta.

The Navajo Indians are very industrious, and find work for themselves
off the reservation when possible. They can always secure work with the
railroads, on the highways, and in the Sawmills. They do not require mach
assistance in securing work for themselves as they are always on the look out
for work. They do not care what kind of work they have, just so it is some
thing they can do.
Other than the General Council of the Navajo Indians, which consists
of representatives franall the Navajo Reservations, we do not have any business
councils or committees.
