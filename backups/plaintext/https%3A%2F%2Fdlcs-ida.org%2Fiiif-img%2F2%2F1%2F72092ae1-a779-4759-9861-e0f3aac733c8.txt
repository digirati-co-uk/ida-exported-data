Four years and three high
schools later: Palau Mission
Academy, Mindzenty High
School, and now Santa Fe
Indian School. I can only put so
much into 50 words, about my
journey through... uh... high
school. I can only thank my
parents for their unconditional
love; my teachers; for their
patience; last but not least my
broda' s n sistah' s, you know
who you are.
