Schools- 4-indications are that it will be increased even more. Possiblya few of the pupils are out of school who should be in school,but it has been necessary to send away a considerable number ofpupils to other schools, such as Fort Mojave, Igancio, TheodoreRoosevelt, and others. The parents resent the sending away oftheir children, particularly the small ones, to distant schools.Their resentment is in a large measure justified. It is highlydoubtful that the average white parent would be willing to sendtheir children 10 or 12 years of age, or younger, to a school some150 or more miles away. The Indians particularly resent sendingsuch distances as Fort Mojave and Ignacio. It would seem that theattendance of the se schools could be brought up to a reasonablestandard by bringing the children closer to these points. The Indiansof the Leupp Jurisdiction show less resentment in sending theirchildren to the nearby schools and it is recommended that thisplan be adopted as a policy insofar as practicable.
