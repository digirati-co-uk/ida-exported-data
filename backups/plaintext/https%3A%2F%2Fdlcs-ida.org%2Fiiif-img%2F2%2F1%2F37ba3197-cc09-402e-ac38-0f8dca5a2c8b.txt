O24July 24, 1914.Pueblo Day Schools, Albuquerque.NARRATIVE.Section VIII---- Contracts.It has been the custom of the Indians to have officersappointed by the Governor look after their business interests,and in some cases these have proven very unsatisfactory, asfor instance at the Isleta Pueblo where it is the duty of the" Capitan de Guerra" to lease their grazing lands this Indianembezzled practically the entire amount received.In many cases the Pueblo officials are antagonistic toprogress and oppose any effort at reform made by the Superintendent.This was particularly true me during the past yeat at San Felipe,vhere it was necessary to imprison the Governor because of hisattitude toward schools, he having attempted to prevent theattendande at Schools of girls over 14 years of age.At Isletaduring the past year a conservative non- progressive man has beenGovernor, vith the result that little, if any, progress has beenmade there.At Laguna very progressive officers have been incharge and they carry on their business in a very model and progressive manner.Considerable funds belonging to the Pueblo aredeposited in the Albuquerque banks and they seem entirely capableof handling their own business.
