In this way and only inthis way, in my opinion, can effective work be done in teachIng the Indians better methods of cultivation, irrigation andsood selection, which will result in better and larger orops,The Indian is so constituted, as are many of his white brothers, as to require actual visual demonstration before hereally accepts any new ideas, I believe this is especiallytrue in farming mattersRamonauPontemporaries to Congressment
