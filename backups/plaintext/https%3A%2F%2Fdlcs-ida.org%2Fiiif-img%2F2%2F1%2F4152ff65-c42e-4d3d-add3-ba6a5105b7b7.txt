PRINCIPAL TEACHER.
Lulu M. Lamar; Missouri; age 35; female; salary$ 660.00
per year; she teaches the advanced grade pupils taking all
her time; character; education; personal habits; qualifi
cations all good, she is the wife of the superintendent,
she is a good teacher, is kind to the children, she is very
energetic, is very anxious to have the school under the
management of her husband prove a success, she is inclined
to interfere with the duties of other employees which they
at times resent, this interfereance on her part causes some
friction, but she seems to be so constituted that she can
not help it, it is a clear case of superintendents wife.
I think it is well that there is some party here who takes
interest enough in the school to see that all are attentive
to their duties. She is a good employe.
