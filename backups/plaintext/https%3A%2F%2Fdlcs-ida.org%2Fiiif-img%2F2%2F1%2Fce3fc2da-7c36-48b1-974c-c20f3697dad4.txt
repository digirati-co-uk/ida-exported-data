The day schools of the Southern Pueblos do not have ample facilities
for bathing the children. Bath houses have been provided as rapidly as
money is available. There are two schools under this jurisdiction where
the water is not fit to use on account of the alkalai in the region. To
build bath houses at these points would mean the installation of some
sort of a water softener which would mean a considerable outlay of funds.
The people in the pueblos on the whole are clean and where due encouragement
is given by the teacher the parents have cooperated in sending their child
ren to school with clean bodies and clean clothing.
