Ind ian.Mahugh called himself" Washington" to the Indians; told themthat the Washington authorities did not like the Mormons; that they werevery bad people; that they inarried too many wives; that these lands we reall to be taken from the Mormons and given to the Indians, etc.I did not then really believe that my. La nds had been allotted.I could not think that a man's farm and home would be taken from himwithout notice, without a hearing, without reason, right or justice.I had had no official notice, and for that matter was never regularlyadvised of the allotment until 1896.Shortly after Mahugh left the second time, a Moqui Ind ian( notone of those to whom I am advised my land has been allotted) came to myplace and staked his horse in my alfalfa patch.As soon as I learned of itI untied the horse and started to lead him away, when the Moqui came upand attacked me, trying to prevent me from taking the horse away.

While inTuba City his attention was drawn to the allotments made by Mahugh, andhe made a careful investigation, taking the testimony from every available source, from Indians and whites impartially, and made a reportrecommend ing that all of such allotments as conflicted with the priorrights of the white settlers be annulled.My st a tement as to Col.Fason's recommendation is of course made upon information.After Col. Fason's report had been filed, Mahugh cane again
