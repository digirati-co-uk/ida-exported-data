This celebration consists of dances, foot races, horse races and
visiting. It is a three day celebration and practically every
Indian on the reservation arranges to attend.
Fourteen townships in the southern part of the reservation are un
allotted Tribal cattle use four of these and the tribal and
Indian sheep use three. The other seven townships are leased
either whole or in part to outside parties for the grazing of sheep
and cattle.
Generally there is sufficient work on the reservation for all
Indians
.
Those who have sheep and cattle find employment thruout the entire
year in caring for their flooks and herds.
For those who do not have sheep and cattle, the Agency farm, Sana
torium, road work and tribal herds and flocks offer sufficient
employment to meet their needs except possibly during the winter
months when there is a short period that road and farm work cannot
be done. It is planned, however, to operate our sawmill during
this period which in a measure will distribute work during this
period of the year when other kinds of work are not available.
Generally, these Indian prefer work in connection with stock rais
ing and farming or road and reservoir work.
