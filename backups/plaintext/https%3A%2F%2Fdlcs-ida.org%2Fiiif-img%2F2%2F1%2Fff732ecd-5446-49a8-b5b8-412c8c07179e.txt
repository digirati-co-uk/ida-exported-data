ANNUAL 1 PORT, 1925.
Narrative.
So bools.
Pueblo Bonito.
As heretofor reported public schools are not within
reach of the Navahos and will probably be a long time
before auch advantage is at their disposal. The Indians
aro very much in favor of sohbols, and want their children to
attend the resrvation schools and are emphatic that they bo
not transferred under the 6th grade. They are positively not
in accord with the sending away of little children ag is now
practiced and at the meeting of the Counoil last July
resolutions were adopted against this polioy. Not satisfied
with this resolution they are secretly collecting money to
defray expenses to Washington in further protest to the
Superintendents sending children to non- reservation schools,
under the grade mentioned.
In my opinion we will get better cooperation if their
wishes are given more consideration than has been done the
past few years, it is no pleasant siuation for one to be in
when parents come and beg you to not send their little
ohildren away but to let them remain here.
In past years this school has done some very good
work in the classrooms but the past year seems to have been
our best as our teachers, thru better training and close
cooperation, attained results that were very gratifying to me.
The cothing year the Boarding school plant can
easily accomodate 350 children; Ã˜t is a disappointment
that the Chas.Burke School could not have been ready for
children at the opening of the coming school year.
