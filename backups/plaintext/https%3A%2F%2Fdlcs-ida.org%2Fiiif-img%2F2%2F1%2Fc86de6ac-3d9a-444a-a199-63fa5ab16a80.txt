PLAY UP, PLAY UP, AND PLAY THE GAME
Besides being the only road to good health through exercise and
fresh air, participation in spprts plays a very definite part in our
social, mental, and emotional development.
Playing together with boys and girls of our own age teaches us to
get along with others, something we have to do all our lives. We learn
through this association to be good leaders and good followers and to
obey the rules of the game just as we inust obey the accepted rules of
life. At all times in any game a player must be mentally alert. He
must act quickly for the good of himself and his team; Kh finds that the
right play at the right time can win the game. I life it is true that
the right play as the right time helps us a c complish many things. Not to
let our feelings get the best of us is a good lesson to learn. An unus
ual display of temper or excitement ruins the fun and enjoyment of the
game. To give, accept, or question decisions gracefully is difficult.
Above everything we should never give up. Each of us knows that to get
around the bases, we must run fast and hard. A losing battle is often won
by perseverance. As the captain shouts in Sir Henry Newbolt' s poem," The
Torch of Life, we must splay up, play up, and play the game
