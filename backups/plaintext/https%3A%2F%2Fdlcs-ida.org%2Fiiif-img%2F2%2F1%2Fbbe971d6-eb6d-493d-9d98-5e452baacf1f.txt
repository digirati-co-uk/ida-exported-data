The girls on the Navajoe Reservation marry young. As a result
there are but few large girls to assist in doing house- work. At the
Little Water School last year, Mrs. DeVore tells me, that the ol
dost girl was only 13 years of age; the boys also be ing young.
Therefore the need of employing help to do the work is more appa
rent. Mrs. DeVore acts as teacher, also as super intendent. She.
receives all supplies for the school and issues them, keeping ac
count of the same, and has to look at and buy the meat for the
school from the Indians. I do not know of any one person in the
service whose energies are so severely taxed as hers, her whole
heart being in her work. She should have more help.
Respectfully submitted.
