Section IV---- Industries( cont.)
during the year, employed as laborers on an irrigating ditch.
Many of them have been manufacturing ties for the Denver and Rao
Grande railroad, and they have done comparitively well and vill
do better as they become more familiar with that line of work.
But very little fencing has been done on the
allotted lands and poorly constructed.
The water resources of the reservation, for irri
gating purposes, is furnished by the Dulce Lake, four miles from
the agency, and La Jara Lake, twenty miles south of the ageney.
The ditches are in good condition.
Springs are scarce, none of any consequence. Some
of the Indians have made small artificial
reservoirs to
store water for irrigation.
Improvements on the allotted lands, up to date,
amount to practically nothing, as the few cabins are small and
the barns and corrals are poorly constructed.
Allotted lands are only leased for short terms
for sheer grazing.
A very small per cent of the allotted lands can be
used for agriculture purpose and as the Indians have but very
few sheep and goats to graze their lands, about their only rev
enue is realized for short leases, to the Mexicans, for sheep
grazing.
The stock owned by the Indians is not increasing,
or improving, as no provision has been made along thosellinos.
Basket making is the native industry of the Indian
women of this reservation and many of the old men make bows and
arrows.
