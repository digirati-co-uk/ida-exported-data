NARRATIVE
Section 1V----- Industries.
la
That there is marked advancement in the Southern,
or Albuquerque, Distriot is patent to anyone familiar with
conditions here four or five years ago.
Greater interest
is taken in stock raising, sheep raising and improving of
horses, and intelligent work is being done in the growing
of alfalfa, grain and fruits.
If like advancement was
made in the Northern District, conditions must have been
appalling formerly.
lb
The season closing October, 1914, was the most
successful ever experienced by the Pueblos of the Southern
District.
Crops were bountiful and excellent prices
were obtained for all surplus.
The abnormal rainfall
was responsible for the heavy crop yield and for the
abundant range feed which resulted in the prime condition
of all stock, cattle, sheep and horses. Wheat and corn
brought the highest prices, and beef and rutton were in
demand at prices that returned a profit to the vendors.
Wool sold at prices in advance of former years.
lo
Soudan Grass seed has been purchased and was sown
this spring.
If this grass succeeds as a dry farm forage
producer it will solve the problem of winter feed for stock.
