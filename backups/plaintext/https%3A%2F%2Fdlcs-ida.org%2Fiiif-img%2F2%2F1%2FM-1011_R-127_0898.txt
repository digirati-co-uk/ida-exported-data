work The girls are given all the industrial courseslaid down in the Revised Course of Study. For the boys,all courses are offered excepting Masonry, Printing, andAuto Mechanics But as just stated, the boys get a gooddeal along the lines of concrete work and every boyin the Engineering department who shows any aptitudefor machinery is given incidental instruction in thehandling and repairing of a Ford car, even althoughthe course in Auto- Mechanics Qs not formally givenIn e general way, our equipment is good, suf.ficient, and satisfactory. A few labor- saving devicesare being added from time to time as funds and opportunity permit For example, just recently, we purchased a" finisher" for the shoe repair shop. Thiswill do the work of many boys and will very probablypay fo itself in a few years in the increased outputof the shopThe accommodations for employees are adequateBut if we are going to expand the capacity of the school,we shall have to provide for additional accommodationsfor teachers This can easily be done if my recommenda.tions relative to proposed additions to Dining Room,asper my reply to Office request for advance estimate ofneeds for 1925, are favorably consideredThe force of teachers and other employeeshere is reasonably efficient in general. In fact,all are rendering acceptable service, some more so thanothers, of course. All seem loyal enough and all butone seem disposed at all times to cooperate with eachother along the lines of general school endeavorThe relations between this school and thepublic school authorities and the general Santa Fepublic as well, are very pleasant In no way is thisbetter shown than in our athletic activities.The school endeavors to meet the most urgentneeds of the Indians by giving the boys such a line oftraining as may increase their annual income( andtherefore their food supply and the other things thatgo to make up a well- ordered home) and the girls suchinstruction as may make of them better housewives inevery wayThe outline of suggestions forming a basisfor writing up this report asks me to say what has beenaccomplished during 1922- 23 on behalf of the Indianswhich, to s ome extent at least, has been more satisfactorythan the accomplishments of the preceding year That wouldbe difficult foE me to say However, I am prepared to saypositively that we have succeeded in thoroughly arousingmost of our older pupils to a realization of the urgentnecessity of securing at least a common school" educationbefore they contemplate leaving off their schoolkafor good.
