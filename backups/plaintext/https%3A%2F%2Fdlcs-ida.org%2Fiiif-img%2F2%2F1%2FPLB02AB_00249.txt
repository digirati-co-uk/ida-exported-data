However, when the bids were received at the Departmentthey gave only the price per page for the printing of these jobs andaccordinglythe Departmentwired you on December18th, for you to wirethe Department the estimated mumber of pages in this brief. However,the Department has no record of receivingyour wire of the 19th whichyou referred to in this letter and accordingly the Department did notauthorize you to print this complaint, due to the fact that we wereunable to ascertain the estimatedexpense. The fact that the Department did not receive your telegramof December 19th, is responsibleforthe delay in authoriza ng the printing of this brief.Your suggestion that you estimate the number of printed pagesfor the printing of a brief from the number of typewrittenpages in theoriginal typewrittencopy is very satisfactory as that is the way theUnited States Attorneys generallyestimate the number of printed pages.Very truly yours,Chief Clerk andAdministrativeAssistant.
