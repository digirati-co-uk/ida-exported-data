Annual Report,Industry- 8Santa Fe Schooland Agencydividuals in the several pueblos in return for labor orservices in the approximate value of the cost of theseimplemente. The issue of agricultural implements to theIndians under this arrangement, that is, in return forlabor or some cornmodity which they raise, is an excell.ent plan and offers a means for a one of the Indians, whootherwise would be unable to pay for these implements,to secure them in such a way as to appreciate theirpossession.A step, which I consider of great importance inindustrial progress in the pueblos, has been taken duringthe past year in the purchase of two grade percheron stallions.

Considering the ex.tensive number o! ponies of little or no market value,whichare of a size so small as to handicap the use of modern farmmachinery, it is apparent that no line of effort offers abetter field for benefit to the Indians industriallyThe history of any people shows that the development and progress of that people along every line has follow.od the dovelopment of their beast of burden. The whole 11feof a people evolves around and about their material resources,which is their industrialplane. When a people have a beastof burden, large and strong enough for farm work in the cultivation and harvesting of their crops, their material resourcesIncrease in proportion to the crops tilled and harvested.Then the Indian ponies are replaced by horses which will average
