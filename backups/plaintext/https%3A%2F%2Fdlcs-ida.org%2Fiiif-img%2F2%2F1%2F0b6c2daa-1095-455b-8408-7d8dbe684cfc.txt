Flags taff, Arizona,June 13th, 1899.The Honorable,The Secretary of the Interior,Washington, D.C.sir:As directed by Department letter of March 14th., 1899, I havethe honor to submit the following report with reference to increasingthe navajo Indian Reservation.I arrived at Flagstaff on the 8th. ultimo, en route to Tuba Cityto carry out Indian office instructions of January 25th. last, relativeto certain land matters and water privileges at iloencopie, and having inview the report called for regarding extension of Navajo reservation,and having, from my visit to this section last summer, learned some thingof the opposition of the settlers of Coconino County to a southern extension of the reservation, as set forth in a report that I had thehonor to submit, under date of August 15th. last, I concluded to remainover in Flagstaff one day, that I might ascertain the sentiment nowprevailing, as to the extension of the Navajo reservation, by extendinga line due west, from the west boundary line of the Moqui reservationto the southeast corner of the Grand Canyon Reserve, thence north, onthe eastern boundary of the said Forest Reserve to its northeast corner,thence west, along said boundary to the colorado River; thence up thatstream to the Indian reservation.I met a number of the business men, including several stockmen, ofCoconino County, while in Flagstaff, and found them all very much opposed to an extension of the reservation, by having the southern boundary a bove proposed, as such a line would include what is known as theCoconino Basin, which is regarded as the best winter range for stock incoconino County. The coconino Basin is appropriated by Coconino Countystockmen, as winter range for stock that is held in the mountains during the summer seasons, which mountains, owing to deep snow in the higher altitudes, have to be abandoned in winter and herds ranged in thelower country.
