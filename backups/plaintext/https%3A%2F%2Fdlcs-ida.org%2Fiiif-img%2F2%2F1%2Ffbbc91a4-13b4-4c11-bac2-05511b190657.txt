State Course, with the language adapted to the home life

4- Grade ili, covering the work outlined in the State

At the beginning of the second semester,& more
rigid adherence
to the State Course of study made necessary
a closer classification
of the pupils, the good results
of which will be more apparent in the near future.
In the kindergarten sections the reading, number work
and industrial work outlined for Grade 1( one half the
course) have been enforced.
The language was adapted
more closely to meet the daily needs of the pupils.
The
entire course, with language adapted, was adhered to in
Grade
1.
The preparation of daily outlines of instruction to
cover at least a week's work was insisted upon in all
schools.
The Office has likewise submitted to the field
suggestive outlines in language for primary A, B, C, and
Grade 1; a years course in elementary hand weaving; a
course in plain sewing for Grades l, ll, and ill; and a
course in cooking and housekeeping.
The industrial
outlines were accompanied by industrial vocabularies and
model lessons.
