14.
They do not use poyote or messal in any form.
15.
They do not purchase and use extracts or proprietary
medicines as a beverage. The trading stores do not handle
these goods. Also The Indians are addicted to the use of
intoxicants
16.
state or National legislats on an orcing prohibits on of
sale of intoxicants of all kinds appears to be the only Buon
cessful way of keeping liquor away from Indians, This will
prove to be affective, and this only.
17.
For the bettering of the present situation in this state
I would suggest the enforcement of the poli oy now advocated by
Congress, vi, the taking over of all intoxicating liquors by
the National Government and the National control of its sale,
( a) Prohibition or county option does not exist in this state,
18,
The Indians under this jurisdiction gamble to some extent
with a native stick game and pitching quoits, for small bets,
At the big feasts they bet some on horse races,
19.
Gambling with cards has been almost entirely stamped out
This is forbidden and the regulation enforced, Gambling on
the stick games and horse races is being great ly dimini shed
by the confiscati on of bets when discovered,
