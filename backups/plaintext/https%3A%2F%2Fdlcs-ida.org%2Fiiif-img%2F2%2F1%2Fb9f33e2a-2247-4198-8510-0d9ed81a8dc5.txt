at the two saw mill camps of Pound Bros.In practically all cases Indians leave the reservation to procuretheir liquor. The towns of Monero, Lumberton, and Parkview to the northand east of the reservation are notorious for their liquor dispensations.Very little cooperation is given by the state in the suppression of liquor.Five employees of this reservation hold commissions as deputy specialofficers.Our nearest deputy sheriff resides near Lumberton, four milesto the east of this agency.The appointment of an employee as Deputy Sheriffwould assist materially in preserving order on and near the reservation.These Indians make a sour mash the call" Tiswin" which is non- intoxicating.They do not use peyote or mescal. Neither do they purchase anduse extracts and proprietary medicines for beverages.The last state Legislature of New Mexico passed a law with very heavypenalty for dispensing liquor within a mile of any Indian reservation.Recent amendment to the National Prohibition Law materially increasing thpenalties for the manufacture and sale of liquor will, no doubt, tend tocurb the bootleggers. Up until this time the traffic in intoxicating liquors has been growing gradually worse and it is hoped national and statelews can be rigidly enforced.These Indians do not now and never haveused opium, morphine or other harmful drugs.Indians do not manufacture either beer, whiskey or wine, and that whichis found within the reservation comes from the outside.Indians and otherscaught with liquor in their possession have been punished. Indians are usuallygiven a jail sentence here and if Mexican or white a case against them is filedin Federal court.While we have not been successful in completely keeping intoxicating liquor from these Indians, yet we have so restrained its use thatconditions are not unfavorable.
