Annual ReportLaw& Order- 3San ta FeSchoolrigated land or have not adequate acreage to raise sufficientcrops for their own consumption. As nearly as can be ascer.tained without a survey, these tracts comprise about twohundred acres of irrigated land and about two hundred acresof good pasture bording on the Chama river and the Rio GrandeThe annual rentals paid in wheat and money do not exceed onehundred dollars, and the revenue thus derived, instead of beingused to the benefit of the pueblo, has been, almost without ex.ception, squandered in liquor by the successive governors andtheir coteries of friends. As soon as I became conversant withthe se facts I took up the matter with the governor and counciland in several conferences, extending over a period of severalweeks, repeatedly pointed out the need of this land for thepueblo, and the desirability from every point of view of thediscontinuance of these leases. The governor and council finallycame to see the wisdom of such action and voted to discontinuethe leases, those for the pasture land at once, and those affecting the agricultural land as soon as the crops then plantedby the lessees were harvested.The opposition to the work of the deputies at San Juanand to the discontinuance of these leases centers in an IndianRanos Archuleta, who has since used his influence to embarrassthe governor in his support of the deputies and conservation ofpueblo lands, in fomenting dissension and strife in the puebloSo far deputies have been established at Banta Clara, SanJuan and Taos, three of the larger pueblos where drinking wasmost prevalent and most marked. Within the last few months,since the establishment of deputies in these pueblos, and theenforcement of federal statutes applicable to the Pueblo Indianaand their lands, there has been practically no drinking amongthe Indians in the se localities. This has been accomplishedlargely by the activity and vigilance of the Indian deputies,and the growing feeling of the lawless element that we meanbusiness in the suppression of the traffic, and that they willonly create serious trouble by open resistance to our effortsIt is worthy of note that there has been no instance of a buseor misuse of authority on the part of the Indian deputiesSome of the smaller pueblos- Nambe, San Ildefonso andTesuque- have so far refused to cooperate with the government
