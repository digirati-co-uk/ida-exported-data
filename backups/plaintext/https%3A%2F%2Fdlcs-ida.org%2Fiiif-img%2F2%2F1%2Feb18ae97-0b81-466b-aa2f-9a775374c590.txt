DRUM OF DEATH
CHRISTMAS
NIGHT
The drums are beating,
The night is blue. clear, and cold;
But, I will not go to the dance,
The moon paints the earth with silver,
I know you wouldn' t be there. For there
is 3: 10w everywhere
:
You are gone, gone where?
There is a singing chorus with
ringing bells,
The drums are beating
But, I will not go to the dance.. Tonight is the night when Christ was
Grandmother
will not be there
born,
At her watching post,
It is the night when the stars led
the Shepherds
to the Child.
The drums are beating
Tonoght gifts are given among friends.
But I will
not go to the dance, As Christ was given first to Shepherds
.
There is an empty place in my heart. It is the night of joy and sorrow,
I am sad.
The night when the singing voices of
angels are heard.
PRAYER FOR RAIN
Oh come, Great Spirit,
Share your tears,
My thirsty plants are dying.
The river is so far away
The land I own is far above
The little
stream nearby
.
Oh come, Great Spirit,
Share your tears,
My thirsty plants are dying.
If no rain comes,
My plants will die.
fill my sad heart with joy.
@ come, Great Spirit,
Share your tears.
My thirsty plants are dying.
