SIT:
I have the honor to report that siter further testing the flour
furnished by Alfred Rathoun for this school, we obtain better results
and it is probable that it will prove to be satisfactory.
We did not obtain good bread from the first three bakings; this was
partly due to the fact that the baker dia not understand the flour and
I have no doubt that better reca
partly on account of the kind of oven.
sults may be obtained by using the regular brick bake- oven than the
sheet iron oven that we have, especially in arm weather.
Very respectfully,
Hilart
