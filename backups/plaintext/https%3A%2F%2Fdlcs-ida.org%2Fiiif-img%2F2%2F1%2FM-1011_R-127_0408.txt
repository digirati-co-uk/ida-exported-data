3 AAnnual Report, 1926San Juan Agency.officeрure bred re ms until nearly every band of sheephas at least one ram of this character, and many bands haveno other class of sires with them. Hence, T believe it safeto say that better than 15% of their breeding stock isone hel or better Rambouillet. Their lambs showed up welllest ill, averaging better than 58 pounds. I cannot saythat their herds are increasing in number for believethe range is fully stocked and has been for many years.However, at the general dipping last fall we dipped aew thousand more than were dipped at the general dipping in 1923, on each of which occasions it was thoughtthat all sheep of the jurisdiction were dipped.These annual dippings are conducted under the immediate supervision of a representative of the Bureau ofAnimal Industry. Prior to last fall all ninals presentedat the vat were examined by this representative, and, ifno evidence of the existence of scabies was found, theherd was given a single dipping. II scabies was foundin any animaoi a herd, this herd was dipped and then givensecond dipping at a later date. Prior to the fall of1925, a preparation known as Black Leaf" 40"", a. tobaccoproduct, wes used. Last fall a coal tar product, knownas Kreso No. 1, was used and every animal was given boththe first and the subsequent dipping. This change wasmade upon advise of the B. A.? I. Scabies was in perfectcontrol, altho it had appeared through- out the year inisolated bands, however, lice were rampant and these liceappeared to thrive on the tobacco product. Through- out.the spring and early summer months the Agency Stockmenand the local representative of the B. A. I., Dr. H. E.Pine, were engaged in experimenting With these liceusing different pro parations. S anpies of all varietiesof lice obtainable were secured and sent to the B, A. Iauthorities at Albuquerque, and, as a result of these experiments, the Kreso No. 1 was selected for use and adouble dipping ordered. The result is that lice havebeen reduced to a minimum and no slipping in the controlof scabies has be en noted. During the late fall and earlywinter months scabies meåe itself manifest in three different parts of the reservation. These bands were promptlygiven a double dipping and the condition seems to be asnearly perfect as it could be in respect to both liceand scabies." The B. A. I. advises that no general dippingwill be undertaken this year as they pronounce the jurisaiction" CLEAN" ihich makes everyone happt. Credit forthis condition is due to sophus Jensen, Agency Stockman,34.
