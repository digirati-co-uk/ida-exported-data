Dear
Sir
:-
I am just
in receipt
of your
lottor
of the 8th instant
, in
which
you ask
to be admitted
as a pupil
of this
school
, and in reply
I would
inform
you that
I would
be glad
to accept
you
as& pupil
, but
.. must
first
be sure
that
you are eligible
for admittano
. to an Indian
School
.
You must
be of Indian
blood
, and
your health
should
be good
.
It will
be impossibl
. for me to pay
your
transportation
to the
school
, a I must
first
obtain
special
permission
to pay transportation
of pupils
from
such
a distance
, and I am quite
sure
that
the Depart
-20
would
not grant
such
a request
, as it is the policy
of the India
Bureau
to bring
Indian
pupils
to the Eastern
part
of the country
in
stead
of farther
Vost.
Ho vover
, it you desire
to enter
this schoal
and will
pay your
own transportation
hors, I wil gladly
onnoll
you at
a pupil.
Vory
respectfully
,
If you
conclude
to come
, vrit
. mi on
what
dat. you
will
runch
Santa
le, and
1 will
arrange
to meet
you at Station
I would
advise
you
to take
the
A. 2. 6. 8.3.04
et
your
nearest
point
, which
probably
will
be
ansah
