it is further proposed
to place an initial herd of one
hundred
or so sheep with each family fitted to care for
them and from such a flock they may not only gain a living
but may in time become assets rather than liabilities
to the
state and nation.
Their acquaintance
with the care of sheep
belonging
to the tribe and experience
for years in connection
with the many Mexican flockmasters
, than whom there are few
better, fits them at once to take up the proposed work and
since their reservation
is strictly
a grazing
area especially
adapted to sheep and goats success is the more promised.
The
one hundred sheep with each family would give them a start
commensurate
with their present needs and while it is not
claimed
that all would make good it is thought that a very
creditable majority would do so and those who fail will find
support and employment with their more fortunate tribesmen
and experience so gained would be such that there would be
hope that in time they, too, could meet with better results
for theras elves.
The health problem would receive its best stimulus
from a vocation that would call the tribe to outdoor effort
and sheep would demand and would have the attention of each
and every member of the family from the three year old up
to the father and mother.
