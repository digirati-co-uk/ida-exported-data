added to the present foror, which would greatly inaroase theefficiency of the medical work. There should also be an ambulanceprovided for the transportation of patients to hospitals. At thepresent time we have only two physiolans on the reservation; twoof our positions being vacant at the present time. The me dicalwork to some extent has been very much neglected owing to theinsufficient number of physicians. The medicine man still holdsfull away in remote parts of the reservation to the detriment ofthe poor unfortunates who firmly believe in their treatment. Asstated, in order to carry out the medical work properly on thisreservation it should be divided up into districts and a trainednurse provided for each district. The nurse should be furnishedwith an assistant who could do the interpreting and assist in anyother way. The medical work will not be a success until this isdone.- 6-
