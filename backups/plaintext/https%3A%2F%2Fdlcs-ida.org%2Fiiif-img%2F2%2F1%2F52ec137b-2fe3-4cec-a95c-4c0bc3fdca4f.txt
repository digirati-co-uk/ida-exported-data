Commissioner of Indian Affairsfor leave of absence, informing that officer thathe was in Texas and too sick to perform service.Sept.20/ '87, E# 24783, instructed Mr. Trotter toobtain Physician's certificate and transmit sameto that office, which Agent Williams says wasdone, but he has not heard from it or Trotter'sapplication for leave.In a business point ofview Mr. Trotter would not be entitled to a leavewith pay, as he took French leave.The customof the Department has been to grant 30 days leavein one year, but at the time Trotter took hisFrench leave he had been in the service only 5months, and that service was very light, as theschool at Aeoma was discontinued on account of themeagre attendance of pupils; and unless the attendance at the Pueblo of Laguna is largely increased the school there should be discontinued.The compensation of$ 1,000 per year for teacherof this day school is in my judgment excessivelylarge.The services of a good female teacher
