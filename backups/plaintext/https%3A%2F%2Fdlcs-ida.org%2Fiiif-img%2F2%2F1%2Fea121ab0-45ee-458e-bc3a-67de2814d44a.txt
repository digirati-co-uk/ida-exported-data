CRITICISM or EVALUATION OF PRESENT CURRICULUM.I. The curriculum made during the summer of 1933 forthe Eastern Nava jo School at Crownpoint, N. Mex. wasmade with the idea of better fitting the Navajo to11ve to a greater advantage in his own enviornment.This, I believe, to be one of the most favorablethings about the present curriculum as a great dealof the work given before was of no beneifit to theNavajo when he returned to his home and instead ofgiving him an ideal to work for it only made himdiscontented and a misfit in his own enviornment.This curriculum has striven to give to the Navajoboy and girl such knowledge as will help them tobetter their own homes and instill in them justpride for their own people and their crafts.Personal health habits, sanitation and healthfulliving conditions are very essential for the wellbeing of the Navajo. These items are given primeimportance in the curriculum. By the continualstressing of these items from the time the childrenenter school on through all the levels, a transferto the Navajo homes is bound to take place by degreesuntil it is a well established thing.One of the greatest handicaps the Navajo has is hisinability to understand and speak the Englishlanguage. Therefore comprehension and oral expressionare placed next in importance to health.In order that the children get no failure complexthe curriculum provides that the children be passedon to another step within the same level if they arenot fitted to go on to the next level. This doesaway with having the same work gone over which holdslittle or no interest for the pupil once having donethe things in that particular way. Even though theessential work is the same the units are entirelydifferent and provide new fields of interest andexpression to the child, and having a differentteacher helps a great deal in not developing thesense of fallure.II. The curriculum states that the child needs at leastone year of English vocabulary work. While I knowthe necessity for vocabulary I feel that it would bebetter to state that the child needs at least oneyear of English speaking experience before enteringinto actual classroom work.Item No. 8 Reading To begin to develop a sentencesense.
