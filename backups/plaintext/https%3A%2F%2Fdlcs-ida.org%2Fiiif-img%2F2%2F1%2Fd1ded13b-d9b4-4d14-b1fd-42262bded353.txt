Hon. Commissioner

I have the honor to inform you that two of the horses at this
School ara absolutely worthless for further use, and are just simply
an expense to the Government. One of them has been at the school for
nine years and is about 19 or 20 years old, he is stiff and lame and
cannot be triven or worked and is only a dead expense. The other one
is about Me Or 15 years old and is about as worthless. He is wind
broken, sti: f, and balky and cannot be made to work and is a dangerous
horse to drive, and the eroployes will not ride behind him.
There is also one more horse here that is a" has been" and, that is
11t for nothing but a cart horse, at which work I can make him earn
what he als.
The the worthless horses should be disposed of immediately, and
I rospectfully ask authority to sell them at public auction to the
highest bidder.
it is absolutely impossible to properly carry on the work of the
school. Without 3 moto horses.
Last year I asked authority to purchase
2 young
sound
horses
and was granted
$ 150.00
by your
office
. My request
