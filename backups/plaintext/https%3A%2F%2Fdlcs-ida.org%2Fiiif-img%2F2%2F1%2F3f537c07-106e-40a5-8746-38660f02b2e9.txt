Powdered wigs are most remembered in the 1600' s, as the" bops ” mark the roaring 20' s, the“ beehives ” or “ bufonts ” were keen in the 50' s, and the freeflowing “ hippy ” hairstyles of the 60' s were groovy. Now inthe 70' s and 80' s, hairstyles are totally awesome dude!Spikes, crew cuts, layered, permed, gelled, braided, curledand sprayed hairstyles are most popular.
