- 1618. While there are no new crops that we are planning on introducing, we are planning on placing muskrats in two of theirrigation reservoirs of the reservation where cat- tails andtules abound.19. Since the construction of better highways to the railroad,many of the Indians trade in Gallup; while their productsare marketed much more advantageously because of these improved highways.( a) The Indian traders are quite fair in their dealings.Since certain changes have been made in the ownership of someof the traders' stores at Zuni there is more competition andthe general price of living has been lowered.20. We have a small sawmill for the cutting of dimension sturrfor our building operations, and the sawing of materials forthe Indians' homes, and for bridges upon the reservation.This has been a Wonderful help to us in the construction ofthe Zuni- Gallup highway and the roads leading to it.21. There are many ruins upon the reservation and several yearswere spent in excavating those at Hawikuh. At the presenttime representatives of the Smithsonian Institute are at workupon the reservation, and because of the fact that they aregiving employment to a number of the Zunis, we are very gladfor this activity.22. We have no Indian fairs but all the agencies in this section join in our exhibit at Gallup at the so- called InterTri bal Indian Ceremonial.23. The Indians have an annual fiesta, the Shaliko, each winter which visitors from the surrounding tribes, as well asmany whites, attend.24. This celebration, or fiesta, is held in the winter timeand while there is no real benefit to the Indians, it takesthe place of our Christmas and is a gathering to which encouragement is given because of the great enjoyment that theIndians receive at this time.25. All grazing land is held in common and is used only bythe Zunis.
