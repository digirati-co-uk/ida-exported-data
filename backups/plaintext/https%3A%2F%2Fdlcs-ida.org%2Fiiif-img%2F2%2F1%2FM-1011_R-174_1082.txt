Bath House
The bath house at the Zuni Day School is one of
the most beneficial buildings in the village. During
the school year the school children bathe once a week
and it is open to the public on Mondays and Fridays.
It is gratifying to see the steady stream of older
men and women and returned students who come every
week. The mothers take all the family for the weekly
bath. In the summer time all the school children who
are in the village make use of the bath house. The
returned students make use of the opportunity to pract
ice the habits of cleanliness formed at school.
Community Center
The Zuni Day School auditorium serves as a
community center for the various activities of the
village. The frequent farm meetings are held there
as well as the returned students meetings, social as
well as business.
Other Schools
Both mission schools maintain grades from the
beginners through the eighth grades. The Christian
Reformed Mission school has three teachers and St.
Anthony' s School has five. The Blackrock Sanatorium
School carries grades through the sixth. It has two
teachers. The pupils are transferred from the different
day schools in the village when medical attention is
needed. As these pupils are placed in the sanatorium
school to regain their health, they are in school only
part time each day.
Health
The health of the school children is an important
part of the school program. More time is devoted to
it alone than any other branch. It includes practical
applications in body cleanliness, clothing, weights,
