Why the Rabbits Tail Is ShortBy JOE A. PEDRO( Laguna)Once there was a rabbit, who, while roaming through the green woodssuddenly came to a river. There he met an alligator and being a wise rabbit,said to the alligator. “ I bet that there are more rabbits than alligators alongthis bank. ”But the alligator refused to say yes.So the alligator said, “ There are more alligators than rabbits along thisbank. ”So the rabbit told the alligator to call all the alligators and line them upacross the river so that he might count them, jumping upon the backs of eachas he went across the river.The alligator called all the other alligators and lined them up across theriver. The rabbit begain counting, jumping on the back of each alligator ashe went across, but before he got to the other end, he laughed while on theback of the last alligator. As he made a jump for the bank on the other side, thelast alligator snapped at him and bit part of his tail off, and that is why therabbit' s tail is short.A Navajo SuperstitionBy SAM PESHLAKAI( Navajo)Long ago, before the white man came to this country, it is said that thecoyote used to talk just the same as a human being. The Navajos say thatthe coyote always gets into trouble or always gets into somebody' s way andcauses trouble. Since then and up to this time the Navajo has had this superstition. Whenever the coyote crosses his path, that means bad luck for him.He would either turn back or sing a sacred song, if he knows one, for protectionfrom evil or bad luck while passing the coyote' s trail.
