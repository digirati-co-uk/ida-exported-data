Dear
Sir:
Replying
to yours
of the 30th ultimo
, pormit
me to say that ir
you can get the Indians
to dig and stone a well at the school, I shoula
consider
same
a good stroke.
I do not feel justified
, however
, in
asking for a winds mill for
the Taos Day- school; there is practically
no land at the school- ho use for a garden
; what little there is can be
irrigated
from the common acequia
, when once extended
, and that the
Indians
have promised
to do.
The Inne diate proximity
of the pueblo
corrals
and the location
of the old
cemetery
makes it a question
whether
the water from a well dug near the school- house
would be safe.
1
really
believe
that the water would be good; but I also know, that
In case of sickness
or epidemic
at the school, if same were to be in
vestigated
by health officers
or others, the location of a well at the
school would be
condemned
.
I should
rather
, therefore
, that you
get the Indians
to dig this well, and if it proves satisfactory
we
mey get someone
to recommend
a windmill. I hesitate
to do so, as stated,
as I can't see the necessity
for same.
I am very respectfully
,
Brandell
Superintendent
.
