SantaFe, NM., Sov. 2nd, 1903.I. W. Dwire,AdditionalHarmer,Taos, N. M.DearSir:Replyingto yoursof the 30th ultimo, pormitme to say that iryou can get the Indiansto dig and stone a well at the school, I shoulaconsidersamea good stroke.I do not feel justified, however, inasking for a winds mill forthe Taos Day- school; there is practicallyno land at the school- ho use for a garden; what little there is can beirrigatedfrom the common acequia, when once extended, and that theIndianshave promisedto do.The Inne diate proximityof the pueblocorralsand the locationof the oldcemeterymakes it a questionwhetherthe water from a well dug near the school- housewould be safe.1reallybelievethat the water would be good; but I also know, thatIn case of sicknessor epidemicat the school, if same were to be investigatedby health officersor others, the location of a well at theschool would becondemned.I shouldrather, therefore, that youget the Indiansto dig this well, and if it proves satisfactorywemey get someoneto recommenda windmill. I hesitateto do so, as stated,as I can't see the necessityfor same.I am very respectfully,BrandellSuperintendent.
