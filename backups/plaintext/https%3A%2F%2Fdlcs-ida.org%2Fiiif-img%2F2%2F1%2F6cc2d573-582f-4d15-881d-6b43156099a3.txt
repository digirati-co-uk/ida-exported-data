BUILDINGS- LITTLE WATER.
Prior to September 1898 there were practically no build
ings for the so- called Day School at Little Water.
Lately
there has been erected a building of an" I" form for the purpose
of school room, dormitory, teacher' s room and lavatory, made of
adobe but very warm and comfortable and a most agreeable change to
the devoted women of that school.
These women
have for years
taught in an Indian hogan with dirt floor and dirt roof into which
you had to stoop to gain an entrance, in fact too dirty for even an
Indian.
The new structure
is fairly well made- the walls and roof
are very good, but the flooring is not very good.
It appears
to be composed more of knot- holes than anything else and the joints
of the same are buckling up so that it is almost impossible to
walk on them.
Nevertheless
it is so very much better than they have been
used to that these ladies will not complain.
A similar build
ing has been promised them and is very much needed.
The other
building
that has been used for dormitories
, dining- room, cook
ing- room& c is a poor affair.
I understand
it cost the Govern
ment about$ 500.00, which is$ 350.00
more than it is worth.
The
supply
of water at this point is small but sufficient
for the pur
pose of this school
and is of excellent
quality
.
Some improve
ments
have been authorized
in the matter
of supplying
water
lately
by the Department
.
Mr. Hazlett instructed
the two farmers Benson
and Benifield
to go to Little
Water
and construct
some closets
.
They were put up in a days time and were very crude affairs
.
In
a short
time
some of them were blown
over and are now laying
on the
