POPULATION,
The Zund Indians have a tribal governing body consisting
of a Governor, Lieutenant Governor, tendeanties, war chiefs,
sun priests, and various other officers, The Governor is a
good reliable, progressive man who is making an earnest ef.
fort to help his people. The others are others are mostly re
actionaries, many times a hindrance to progress, if their
influence was allowed to have any weight. An effort is made
to neutralize this and in spite of them the people are progres
sing. They have been in the past a considerable hindrance
to the proper discharge of my official duties but as I do
not recognize them to any extent their influence is waning.
These Indians have no antities or tribal funds of
O
any kind.
