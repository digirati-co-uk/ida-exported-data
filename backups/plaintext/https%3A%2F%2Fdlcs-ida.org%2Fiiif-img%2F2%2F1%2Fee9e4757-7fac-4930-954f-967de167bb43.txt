per year; teacher taking all her time; character; education;
personal habits good; qualifications fair. She is a good
teacher in the school- room. Mrs.Kinney has a husband and
two children, the children are with her, her husband is em
ployed at the Pima school, she is very anxious to be trans
ferred to some school where she can be with her husband,
she is inclined to meddle with other peoples affairs which
usually makes trouble, perhaps if she were with her husband
she devote more time to her own duties, and not have so
much time to look after the welfare of others. She should
be transferred from this school, she is a disturbing element
here, her days of usefulness at this place are over.
