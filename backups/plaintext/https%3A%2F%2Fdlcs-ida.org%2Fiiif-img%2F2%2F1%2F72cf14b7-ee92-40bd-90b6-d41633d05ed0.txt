the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
Agent Walpole knows nothing of them further than they
were recently appointed to this agency; they were instructed to
report to the superintendedt of the Alburquerque school; at the
time of my inspection of that school they had not reported for duty,
neither did Mr. Holland then acting superintendent, or myself know
they had been appointed; I did not consider it worth while to spend
the time and money to visit them at this time, as it would take sev
eral days; Zuni is 40 miles from the rail road, and Acoma 25 miles
from the rail road.
I examined the books and accounts of the agency and think
them correct; I think the funds received by the agent have been ju
diciously expended after proper authority had been granted. All
Government property was duly accounted for.
I examined all the open market purcahsses which were nu
merous, and think those made were a necessity and could not have been
avoided; I think the prices paid were fair and reasonable; no favor
itism was shown, and no extra expense was incurred in making such
purchasses.
Jicarilla Sub- Agency.
This reservation is located in the mountains of New Mex
ico, the face of the country is badly broken, the altitude at the
agency is between 7400 feet, and 7500 feet, in many places on the
reservation it is much higher; it is an arid country, and cannot
in any sense of the term be considered an agricultural country;
in some of the small vallies, good crops could usually be produ
sed if water could be obtained for irrigation,
It is a very good grazing country, this reservation with
its small lakes and small streams in the mountains which disappear
before they reach the vallies is well adapted to sheep raising.
It is considered by the white and mexican sheep owners
as the best place for miles arround to take sheep during the lamb
ing season.
