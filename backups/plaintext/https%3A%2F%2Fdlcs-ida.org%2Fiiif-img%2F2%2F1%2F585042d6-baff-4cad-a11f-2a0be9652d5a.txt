and large numbers of coyotes and bobcats are yet left to
continue their depredations.
A plan is now being outlined
for a continuation of the campaign against predatory animals
for the coming season giving especial attention to coyotes
and the Biological Survey offers to continue in directing
and assisting in the work.
Total annual losses for both cattle and sheep for
the fiscal year range from twenty five to fifty per cent.
Extreme weather, heavy snows, predatory animals, and
shortage of feed factored in large measure and while a
repetition of such extreme conditions may not be expected
for an age, stockmen are prompted to provide more liberally
in every way to meet the worst that may come.
The extreme
conditions have reduced the lamb and calf crops but the
heavy snows will result in a general betterment of the
grazing area which will go far in offsetting the losses of
the year.
