Honorable Commissioner 5
an ample supply for the use of the school but with so small a risk and
$ 0 great
a result in case of success
It seems to mo woli to tako the
risk. I thus lay the matter before you in the aloarost light that I ca
expect to get. I have ridden and walked fot miles and miles over this
valley, have interviewed every man both wise and other wise who could
possibly have an idea of value
in the mattor
and I boliovo that I now
know all that is to be known
in this line until farther investigation
is jag.de
I certainly have no personal
interest in this matter. The t
Lavestigation will be only a matter of worry and vexation to me, but a
let
an opportunity of such vast interest
to the school rest
without trial.
In writing the foregoing, I do not
vish to even seor to
dietate to the Indian Office what ought to be done. Uy
desire is to g.
give a good and sufficient reason for ny belief in a possible water sup
ply and then submit
quietly and food natursdly to the orders of the
office
I am, very respectfuily,
your obedient servant
a.
