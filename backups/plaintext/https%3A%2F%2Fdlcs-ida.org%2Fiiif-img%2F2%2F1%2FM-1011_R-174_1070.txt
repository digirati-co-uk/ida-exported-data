The Zuni sheep are mainly of the Merino type.
There has been introduced considerable Rambouillet
blood in the past 20 years which has tended to im
prove the flocks. The introduction of Cotswold blood
in the past few years has also improved the staple
of the wool and the general conformation of the animals.
The flocks should be subjected to close culling, so
that only the better class of animals be retained.
In this way a higher quality of wool and lambs would
be produced, and the numbers of sheep on the range
materially reduced. The control of the sheep grazing
would then be somewhat simplified and overstocking
of the range considerably lessened.
Previous to the spring of 1932 there had been
very little control exercised over the management of
livestock on the ranges of the Zuni Indian Reservation.
This lack of control has resulted in the forage crop
being seriously depleted. The results of this lack
of control are in evidence everywhere upon the range.
Those ranges waich at one time apparently produced
ample forage are in most cases badly trampled and
over- grazed and are now producing only a small amount
of forage and plants of low or no palatability.
This depletion of the ground cover is directly respon
sible for the excessive soil erosion now going on.
The principal causes of this serious range deterior
ation are these:
