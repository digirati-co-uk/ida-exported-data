ce OF INDIANASE RECEIVEDJUL 6- 1910Cir. 433EDUCATION DIVISION.- SCHOOL SECTION.There are no children from either of the reservations attending public schools at present. Arrangements are under way fora contract with Dehesa school for the admission of the Indian children of Sy quan reservation, which is one mile and a half from theIndian village to the school house. Here tofore these children haveattended this school very irregularly the results not being satisfactory.Should we succeed in entering into a contract for next year, andthe Superintendent with the aid of his policeman who resides there enforces a regular attendance, there is no doubt but that the chilÄ‘ren will derive as much if not more benefit from it than they wouldin the Government Indian schools.The relationship between the Government Indian Schools andPublic schools in this section of California is harmonious as faras I have any knowledge. We are adopting the state course of study,grading our schools on the same lines as the public schools, andreceiving anXXXXXXXX visits from public school officers and teachersand returning them.The Indian youth seem to get along well withthe white; the white children attending the Indian Fiestas and engaging in the sports common to both, the Indians also attending picenics and celebrations gotten up by the white people in the near bytowns
