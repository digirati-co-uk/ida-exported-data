Thank you for your statistical report in connection with the
Navajo Indians under your jurisdietion. The orrico requests that
you furnish an estimate of the number of death, which have occurred
among the Navajos during 1929 based upon information concerning
the death rate among those Indians, which, of course, is consider
ably in excess of that for the general population. As the office
moto you in a previously lotter, the general death rate for Indi.
an, in 1988 was 21.8, it can probably be taken for granted that
the death rato among the Navajo la considerably in excess of this,
because their birth nte is very much aigher than that for the
General Indian population. Kindly submit figuro, in this conneo
tion at your vory oarliest contendono..
In connootion with the reporting of contagion and infoetion
for the Navajos, the orrie voula 11b Information as to whether
or not thi. m. ineluded in the data for the total jurisdiction;
