aCircular# 2100.ANNUAL REPORTNARRATIVE SECTION.Hopi Indian Agency,July 6, 1925.SECTION I- LAW AND ORDER.1. Agency Buildings and Equipment sufficient exceptingwood- working machinery and Police Headquarters andJail. We very badly need a jail for insane and crimeinclined Indians. It is inhuman to treat them the waywe have to in order to hold them and protect theother Indians. This want has been placed before theIndian Office many times and I can not see why we arenot given enough money to treat these Indians rightwhen they have to be incarcerated. The way police haveto sleep out when they are at the agency is a disgraceto the Service and detrimental to their loyalty.2. Our agonoy employee force is inadequate to do thework necessary to bring forth or editable results because of the nature of the country and the scope of worknecessary to accomplish what may be accomplished atother locations. The desert fights every one andovery thing in the most terrible way.3. There will never be proper Law and Order on thisreservo with the present conditions and small andineffective Police Force. This is a fundamentalproposition and without good law we are standing still80 far as inculcating into the minds of these Indianswhat is proper in the way of good morals, right livingand the rese peot for laws as observed by those outsidereservations. We should have to obey laws similar toothers in the stato and the Indians made to understandthat there are no such thing as no laws for them orone set of laws for them and another set for whites.Wo should carry out the State laws on this reserveand have an effective Law and Order force to handleevery conceivable situation. Proper marriage shouldbe enforced for without it decent homes are impossibleand without decent homes good citizenship is impossible.Crimes run from Murder down. Additional Legislationis not necessary, excepting a law making it positivelyne cossary for the agency to enforce State Laws. Thelaws of the state of Arizona should be extended tocover this reservation and they should be enforced
