POPULATION.
The councils of the Zund tribe are much the same
as mother pueblo tribes. The pesonaal is generally
made up mostly of older members of the tribe, They do
not average up as having a very high intelligence.
The whole fabrio of the tribe is bound up in this
form of government. Though I sometimes think it would
be advisable to ignore them, it would not stop their
activities. Therefore it will be better to recognize
them and at the same time away their viewpoint so that
it will Bwerve more into liberal, progressive policies
as time elapses.
The Be Indians have no anuities or trust funds.
