The Santa Fe Indian School' s success is the result of local control,
which demands a high degree of parent and community involvement.
There are other indicators of the school' s excellence, as well. Santa Fe
Indian School has an excellent residental program to support its rigor
ous and challenging curriculum. The dedicated and experienced staff
set high standards for the students and expect that those standards will
be met. The school' s Community- Based Education model, in which
Santa Fe Indian School' s students work on environmental issues in
their home communities, has received many awards. Some of the rea
sons for the schools success are less tangible. Students mention a
sense of belonging, a caring environment, a place where parents and
students feel at home. As one student commented, “... the difference is
that teachers really teach and the people really care... ”
Because of the efforts of the school' s leadership, the future for Indian
education at Santa Fe Indian School looks even brighter than the glow
ing achievements of its past. It has been a most exciting experience to
share the beginning of a new tradition, in a revitalized school filled
with pride and confidence.
