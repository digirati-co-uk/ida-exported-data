Some of the boys tried to soften up the skins. We took
three more of them up to the Hogan. We have plenty of skins
to use in the Hogan now. The children get very tired of sit
ting on the skins. When I suggest they make some chairs, they
always seem to think it is too hard work, but two of the boys
worked on a chair this morning. we are going to the farm to
get some willows. We need some wood that will bend easily
for the back of the chair.
We saw a bluebird with a twig, and so we concluded
they were building their nest. we thought it would be nice
to make a birdhouse for the bluebirds. We saw a picture of
a log cabin that had been sued for a bird house. We thought
we would try to make a bird house shaped like a hogan. Lindy,
Leonard, and Earl started making the bird house. They cut
the wood into small sections, and fitted them together.
They
have the walls all made, and they will be ready to make the
roof tomorrow.

Lindy and Earl went after some twigs to make the
roof of the Hogan bird house. This made it look like logs.
They found it hard to get the logs nailed in place.
Some of the boys worked on the chair. We had been
to the farm to get the willows, so they nailed the branches
of the willows on it. They used the willows for the upper
part of the chair, because they bend more easily than most
things. Harry got some yucca to wrap around parts of it
to make it stronger.
We still have a few more skins to finish.
