May 14,Some of the boys tried to soften up the skins. We tookthree more of them up to the Hogan. We have plenty of skinsto use in the Hogan now. The children get very tired of sitting on the skins. When I suggest they make some chairs, theyalways seem to think it is too hard work, but two of the boysworked on a chair this morning. we are going to the farm toget some willows. We need some wood that will bend easilyfor the back of the chair.We saw a bluebird with a twig, and so we concludedthey were building their nest. we thought it would be niceto make a birdhouse for the bluebirds. We saw a picture ofa log cabin that had been sued for a bird house. We thoughtwe would try to make a bird house shaped like a hogan. Lindy,Leonard, and Earl started making the bird house. They cutthe wood into small sections, and fitted them together.Theyhave the walls all made, and they will be ready to make theroof tomorrow.May 15,Lindy and Earl went after some twigs to make theroof of the Hogan bird house. This made it look like logs.They found it hard to get the logs nailed in place.Some of the boys worked on the chair. We had beento the farm to get the willows, so they nailed the branchesof the willows on it. They used the willows for the upperpart of the chair, because they bend more easily than mostthings. Harry got some yucca to wrap around parts of itto make it stronger.We still have a few more skins to finish.
