INDIAN LEADERS OF THE RIGHT KIND FOR INDIAN DEVELOPMENT
The call today among the Indians is for strong and in
spiring native leaders, men and women of brain and brawn, uns
selfish, with high ideals and full of a desire for disinterested
servi–æe to their people. There are a large number of Indians
whose lives are thus ordered, scattered about in different
Ste, tes, where Indians reside
Many of these men and women have worked hard to raise
the standard of 1iving among their people. They have stood
champion for the right. They have firmly pressed forward for
the protection of the weak and ignorant among the Indians
against the spoliation of the graf ter, the" bootlegger," and
the crook, These Indians deserve credit for their example of
clean living and helpful service to the others
All the more
so because it is not an easy matter for a bright Indian, who is
educated and influential, to keep straight in some Indian
communities, where the pressure, within and without the reser
vation, is often strong and insidiously directed for wrong doing
Unfortunately there are some Indians with a good educa
tion, who have had advantages of training and travel, who use
this advantage improperly for personal gain and detrimentally
to the welfare of their people, While there are bad and vicious
among all races, and the tricky among the dominant white race
are quick to make use of those in primitive races who are sus
ceptible, it is extremely unfortunate when these are found among
our Indians. They not only do great harm and injury directly
