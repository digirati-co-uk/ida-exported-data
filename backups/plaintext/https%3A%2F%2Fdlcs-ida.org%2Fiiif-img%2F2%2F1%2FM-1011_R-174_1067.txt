The winter of 1931 and 1932 was an exceptional
winter in the amount of snowfall and extreme low
temperatures. An unusually heavy snowfall came in
la te November which was followed by more snow and ex
tremely cold weather which lasted for about four months
made the winter an unusually hard one for both the
Indians and the Indian livestock.
The Forest
The forest resources of the Zuni Indian Reser
vation are not extensive. There are only six con
iferous species represented on the reservation, namely,
yellow pine( Pinus ponderosa), pinon pine( Pinus
edulis), juniper( Juniperus monosperma), red cedar
or juniper( Juniperus utahensis,), alligator juniper
( Juniperus pachalopha) and Douglas Tir( Psudotsuga
taxifolia). Probably 95 per cent of all coniferous
trees on the reservation are pinon pine and junipers.
There are practically no hardwood trees growing
on the reservation. Some of the creek bottoms have
some cottonwood( Populas macrocarpa) and there are
some small groups of willow( Salix sp.). Gambel oak
( Quercus Gambellii) is found in small areas in nearly
all the canyons and upon most of the mesa lands.
The only tree of commercial or lumber value found
on the re se vation is yellow pine.
