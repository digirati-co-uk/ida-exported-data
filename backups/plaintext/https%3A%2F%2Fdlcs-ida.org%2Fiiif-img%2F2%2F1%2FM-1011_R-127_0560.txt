Annual ReportField- Irrigation- 4.Santa Fe SchoolandAgency.sponsibility cannot follow through the present arrangement,whereby the Irrigation Service operates independently ofthe superintendent. Such work, as is done in this districtby the Irrigation Service at present, in nearly every instance is done without taking the superintendent into con.sideration, I believe that, if the superintendent is atall conversant with conditions in his district, he is inall probability more conversant with conditions and theneeds of the Indians under his jurisdiction than any otherperson could be. I believe that the present system wherethe Irrigation Service comes into a district or jurisdic.tion, acting independently and in some cases without theknowledge of the superintendent, the work thus accomplishedis not done as economically or expeditiously as it would be11 under immediate direction of the superintendent,I believe there should be one policy in the conduct of work and administration of affairs in a district.I do not believe that the present lack of cooperation andconsultation in the work and plans for irrigation in thisdistrict may be laid at the door of the superintendent.I know that I have personally requested investigations bythe Irrigation Service to deternine the feasibility ofcertain projects, which have appealed to my judgement tobe feasibleand needed, and have been to ld that such investigations would be made, and yet have never been informed of any steps to that end, I have further placedmyself at the disposal of the Irrigation Service, andoffered such assistance at any time as might be possiblefor me to render. I feel that the superintendent shouldbe consulted upon irrigation matters in his district, inorder that the plans of any progpeotive work might beproperly laid before the pueblos and their cooperation ingured, and I feel that no work should be undertaken in anythe pueblos without his knowledge and cooperation. Irealize that a superintendent' s knowledga of irrigationmatters is that of a layman, and yet I believe his know.ledge of conditions and of the needs in the pueblos underhis supervision should receive consideration.I would not apply this recommendation to largeprojects similar to the Taos reservoir, which is now underconsideration, but I do feel the justification of its application to such small irrigation work, as should be undertaken
