V- 4- 8-SECTION 3----- SCHOOLS2.The best of feeling exists between the public school atZuni and the Indian schools. The same is true with referenceto the Mission schools and the government school. In ourField Day exercises on May 1 all the schools of the villageand the one at the Sanatorium, joined in the health exercisesand sports of the day.There are more school facilities within reach of the Zuniohildren than there are pupils for filling the schools.The needs of the school at Zuni, which is known as the DaySchool, are well cared for in our approved requests for thecoming fiscal year.( a) The school plant is in good condition and is sufficientfor our needs.( b) There is no school farm as the Sanatorium farm( for supplying vegetables for the sanatorium patients) is all that isneeded here.3( c) We have need of an assistant to the engineer at the DaySohool as his duties are such as to require his time fromearly morning until 9: 30 at night. The Indian police relievesthe engineer to some extent but this takes him from otherneeded Work.4. There are no graduates as a transfer is made to non- reservation schools upon completion of the Sixth grade.5. The mission schools compare quite favorably with the government schools.6. The morality of the Zunis is on an average with that of similar tribes in this section. They are quite slow in adoptingnew methods and adhere to their ancient customs and modes ofliving to too great an extent.7.( a) All children who are physically able are in school.( b). We have but one incorrigible case and this boy is beingkept temporarily at the Agenoy headquarters but wiii be transferred to a non- reservation school this fall.
