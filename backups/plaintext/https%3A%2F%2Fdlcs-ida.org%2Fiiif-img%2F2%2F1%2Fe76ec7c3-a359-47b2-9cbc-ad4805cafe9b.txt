more than three thousand cords of wood, at$ 2.00 per cord.
At this time they are working at the MoGaffey Lumber Mill
seventy- five Indians and are paid$ 2.50 to$ 5.00& day.
About twenty are working on the Zuni Mountain Railway re
pairing the track at$ 2.50& day, and about fifty are civilian
guards at Fort Wingate, where a large quantity of T& T Explosive
is stored, and each receives$ 3.50 a day. At this time there is
no need for assistance to Indians in finding employment. It is
hard to keep the Nava Joes working steady, for too often with the
acumulation of little money he wants to go on a vacation in
stead of making the most of his opportunity. Of course during
the winter months there is little work. The Nava joes have no
special liking for any particular class of work but is a good
ailround laborer. At Gailup he is particularly in demand to
work on sections or in reund hone at the Santa Fe Shops.
