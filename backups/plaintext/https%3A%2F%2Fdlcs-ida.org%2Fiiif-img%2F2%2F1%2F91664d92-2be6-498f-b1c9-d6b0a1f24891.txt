Nuts. Sold by. Superintendent
: Several
of the employes
of the school
sent through
Mrs.Grozier
, who was then an employe
of the school, to a
friend
of hers
in Texas
for some pecan
nuts for their
own use. In the

Mrs.Grozier
went to Cochiti

share
of the nuts

of; I sold them to
whomever
wanted
them, at first cost and received
no conmission

Two Horses Died: The Superintendent
has not killed two horses by hard
driving
; nor is it the general opinion
of the citizens
of Santa Fe that
such is the case; one of the horses
was never driven by the Superintendo
ent except occasionally
to and fro Santa Fe, a distance
of two miles;
and not at all t'or several days before he died.
A full and complete
statement
of the death of these horses, was made
to the Indian office
with the quarterly
reports
, at the proper time.

three of the boys of the school

each boy. I received
no cormossion
for my trouble
Waste, etc. The Superintendent
has not and does not allow pupils to be
careless of their clothing; most of the children
in school during the s
last fiscal year were direct from the camps and had to be taught correct
habits, especially
in regard to the care of their clothing; all the ein
ployes were asked to assist in teaching habits of order, cleanliness
and
neatness
; the school carpenter would do nothing in this direction
;
this is one reason wy he was asked to resign,(

Sabbath Day observance: Children from the camps naturally engaged in
the same games on Sunday xx that were played on other days; this was

; these habits have

dicts.culty in correcting these habits had not the School Carpenter al
