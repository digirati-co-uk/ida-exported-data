Espanola, V, Mex,
I have been informed that is some of the Pueblos, there is
an impression that do not wish to receive any more pupils, but this
2.s a mistake, ana wish you vould so enorm the Indians of your Pueblo.
I now have 300 pupils in attendance, but can accomodate quite a
Tow more.
As the traveling expense funds are now entirely exausted,
it will be possible for me to pay eriything for bringing pupils here,
Dut any of the indians are desirous of paving the children enter
will be glad to take them on that condition,
All the sent a Clare children here, are well and are getting along
vory niosivo
Waih pest regards, I am very truly yours,
ite
,
Superintendent.
