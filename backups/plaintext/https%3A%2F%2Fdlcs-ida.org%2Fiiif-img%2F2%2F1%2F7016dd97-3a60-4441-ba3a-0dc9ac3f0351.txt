-32Generally speaking, the Beautiful Mountain structurehas not been looked upon with much favor, particularlySo since Tocito and Table Mesa encountered water in theDakota, There have been so many upsets' and surprisesin this area, however, that no one is willing to predictwhat might be encountered and the writer wouldn't besurprised at finding either oil or water.In the high area at the north end of the fold noton the sale tract, the Dakota sandstone is exposed inone spot, covering an area of approximately one- quarterof a section. The whole structure is immediatelyadjacent to the Chuska Mountains on the west.The Tocitosandstone dips away from the west escarpment of the structure into a sharp syncline and then rises again on theflanks of the mountains mentioned.BOUNDARY BUTTE STRUCTURE.One of the most important discoveries of oil in theFour Corner area and within the Executive Order portionof the Navajo reservation, was that made in the test wellbeing drilled by the Southwest Oil Company( subsidiarytoMidwest Oil Co.) and the Mutual Company. A good grade of42 gravity oil, with no gas, was found at a depth of 1560to 1568 in the shinarump conglomerate, March 15, 1924.Oil rose into the hole approximately 1000 feet, but thereis somewa ter present and an effort will be made to determine its source and shut it off in the very near future.The well was fitted with pump equipment and is now pumping 30 barrels of oil per day and 100 barrels of water.Considerable difficulty has been experienced indrilling to the Shinarump on account of crooked holetrouble and caving formations. One well was abandonedat 1180' on account of caving hole and frozen pipe. Theobjective horizon in each well has been the Pennsylvanianformation, whose estimated depth has been given as approximately 3200 feet. The oil in the Shinarump was unexpectedby the operating company and its productiveness has led tothe making of three more locations by the Midwest Refininggroup and one by the Union Oil Company of California.Theselocations are now being drilled to a depth of 500 feet asvalidation holes, but eventually will be drilled to eitherthe Shinarump or Pennsylvanian.LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION.The Boundary Butte structure, which is located insoutheastern Utah, is a long unsymmetrical anticline trending
