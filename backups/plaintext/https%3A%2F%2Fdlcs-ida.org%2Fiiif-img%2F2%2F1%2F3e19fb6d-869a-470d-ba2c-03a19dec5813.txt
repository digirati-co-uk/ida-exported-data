The Hon. Com'r

Sir:
Referring
to the matter
of securing
title
to land on which
this
school
is gituated
, which
was the subject
of your
communica
tions
of November
10th, 1892
and January
11th, 1893, I have
the
honor
to state
that
I have
been unable
to secure
a deed
from
the
University
of New Mexico
for
that portion
which
has not
yet been
conveyed
to the United
States
.
The Trustees
of the University
of New Mexico
have
not held
a meeting
for months
, and have
not
yet taken
any action
in regard
to securing
a deed
and making
cona
veyance
to the United
States
.
They have repeatedly
been asked
to attend
to the matter
, and have
promised
to do so soon
,
Alter
the deed
to this
protion
of the land has been
secured
it will
be
very
difficult
to secure
an abstract
to this and
the other
pargels
of land
that
have
been
conveyed
to the Government
.
The grant
on which
the school
farm
is situated
( consisting
of about
500 acres
) was made
to Domingo
Valdez
, by the Spanish
Government
in 1742.
All the original
grant
papers
complete
, are
among
the apchives
of the Surveyor
General's
office
at Santa
Fe.
