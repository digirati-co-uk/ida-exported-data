A small portable, semmil is in operation. This is
the property of the Government. Indians bring logs and
hey are sawed up into lumber, A BEAli toll is taken

rich in antiguities. Some excavation has been done,
with Depettrnental permit, of the old ruin of Hawakoo

Good exhibits at the annual" Intertribal" meet in
Gallup. Zuni exhibits attract considerable favorable
comment.

Grazing on tribal land is watched carefully to
prevent overgtazing. The reservation has not nearly
sufficient grazing Grazing is leased outside the
reservation to help out. The grazing leases are made
