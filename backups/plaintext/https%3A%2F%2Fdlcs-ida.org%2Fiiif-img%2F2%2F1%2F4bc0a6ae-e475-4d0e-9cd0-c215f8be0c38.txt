( 3)single seed germinated. The second year a few melons and 7vegetables were raised. The third year, with our new pumpingplant in operation and an immense amount of work necessaryto prepare the ground, our oats and alfalfa proved to be aperfect failure. A few melons and vegetables were raised.This present year we tried kaffir corn and oats, forprincipal crops, but it was all to no purpose. Even thevegetables were not as good as last year-- and no melonswhatever were raised.The soil is Adobe of the poorest quality and lacks allthe elemente necessary to make good land. Mr. M. M. Murphy,Supervisor of Farming, on his first visit to this School,said that we would never be able to make farming or gardeningprofitable. I thought this could not be so-- and went at itas if we had the finest land on earth, but two years ofabsolute failure is enough to dishearten the strongest hearted.It is well known that in this country there have beenlarge areas of this land along the Little Colorado river lyingup the stream above us-- and even at a higher elevation thanwe have here that have been abandoned by settlers, principalyMormons-- on account of alkali contained in both the waterand the soil. It is safe to say that where the Mormons fail( in making land productive) it would be idle folly for othersto try.
