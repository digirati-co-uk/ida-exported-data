San Juan School& Agency
prohibition in adjacent towns in New Mexico has been a material
help to the same end.
There has been no drunkeness anong the Indians, which has
come to my knowledge, during their visits to towns in Colorado
and New Mexico adjacent to the reservation where state pro
hibition and local option exists.
In this connection no liquor has been introduced within
the reservation from outside points with the exception of
Gallup.
There is very little gambling among the Indians under
this jurisdiction. This is due to the forceful measures
which were taken soon after the establishment of this agency
to eliminate this evil. Formerly gambling with cards was
a common practice.
I low of no decisions rendered during the past year,
either in the State or Federal Courts which have had a par
ticular bearing on or have specifically affected the Indians
on this reservation either in criminal, civil, or equity
matters.
