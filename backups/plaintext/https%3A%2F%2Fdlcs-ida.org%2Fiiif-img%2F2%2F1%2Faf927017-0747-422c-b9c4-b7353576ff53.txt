Sec. 6 Meld: Irrigation
any repairs have been made to ditches during
the year, chiefly by labor in lieu of miscellaneous sup
plios issued to Indians, and the extension of the ditch
from Dulce Lake over school lands adjacent to the agency
was oonploted for one and a quarter ailes.
ALLOT
ENTS,
This land is considered surplus sohool land,
as it is too far from the school for proper care and
is not needed to school purposes. There are, however,
several allotments that have been mado on patented land,
and those allottees must be reallotted somewhere, Auth
ority has been ganted the superintendent to re- al lot
these Indians and submit a schedule to the Indian of
fice for approval. The land mentioned above, on which
the ditch has been placed, will be very suitable for
this pur pose.
lo patents in fee havo eter been grated to
any of these Inai an, nor havo any of their lands been
sold; and they oan no t be for some time to come, as the
ttmbor on the land is tribal property, while the land
itself belongs to the individual allottlos. The surplus
lands are of very little value and of small area.
