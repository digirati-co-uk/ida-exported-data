Thos are frame building and
18 X 48 are in very poor condition, and at.
a disgrace to the school. in my lan
annual estinat â€¢ I called the attention of
your office to this taot, but no sistem
was made. These building should do som
down and good slibstantial brick onts
erected, and I urgently recommend that
appropriation be made for this purpose
at not to exceed$ 1,000.00 for Hach
building
2 Water Closets, 13 X 24.- 1/2 These closets are trane building
and are in a dilapitated condition,
The foundation timbers have rotted to
such an extent that is only a question of in
when they will be unfit for use. I have had
them pashed and repaired from time to time
They were located in the wrong places at first, and
should be torn down and good brick ones erected and
placed in a more suitable location, I urgently recommend
that$ 1,400.00 be appropriated for this purpose during
the next fiscal year.
| Ware House 20 X 40
This is a one story brick building
and is in good condition, but is entirely
too small to store more than one half of the school
supplies It has been nossary for me atore a
great part of the supplies in the cellars anf lofts of the
main school building, and this has been a constant source of
annoyance A good large addition should be made to this
building, and I most Harnestly and urgently recomend- for the
bus interests of this school that a sum not less than
$ 1,500.00 be appropriated for this purpose. This building
was even too small when the appropriation was for 150 pupils
and now when the schools attendance will be 250 and even
greater in the future, it will be an absolute impossibility
to store the school supplies without the greatest annoyance
and inconvenience, and without occupying rooms that are ro
quired for other purposes.
