Sirs:
I beg to inform you that there should be argeted at the Jomo.
Pueblo Day School two outside closets for use of pupils and employes
of the school.
The closet now being used is in very bad condition
and is practically beyond repair.
The sun of$ 50.00 should be auth
orized to construct these much needed closets.
There are also a few
repairs which should be made to the school building, but it is poss
10le that the sun asked for will meet the requirements.
If you will
authorize me to make these inprovenients I will see that the work is
done without delay. Pas Cheap
Very respectfully,
ê·¸ a
Jormace
FJM.
Superintendent.
