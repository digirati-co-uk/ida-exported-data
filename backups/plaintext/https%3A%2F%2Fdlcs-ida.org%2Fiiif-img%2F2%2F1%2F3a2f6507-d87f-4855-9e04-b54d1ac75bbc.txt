These matters should be thoroughly investigated.
Mr.
Hazlett requested Mr. Shoemaker to inquire into the facts in
regard to attendance at this school and when I met Mr. Shoemaker
he had just returned from the Blue Canyon School.
Upon inquiry
of Mr. Shoemaker I learned that he
had not entered into the de
tails as fully as he should have done, especially in regard to
the matter of subsistence, as to what had become of it and also
to take some time with an assistant, if neccessary, in determin
ing definitely whether Mr. Neadham was falsifying his report of
attendance, and dealing dishonestly with the Government.
He
should have taken the affidavit of Mr. Neadham in regard to all
these facts and others, if possible, by making a regular examination.
I have appended herewith copy of the report of attendance as made
by Mr. Neadham, showing that he has reported from time to time an
attendance of 15- also report of issues, whether all or not I can
not say, for 15 scholars.
The matter is too important for the
Bureau to pass over.
I believe Mr. Hazlett would, ifproperly
instructed, obtain in the proper form a full and definite state
ment of the facts in the case, but by all means Mr. Neadham should
have a chance to defend himself, in other words he ought to be
called upon to clear himself of the charge.
This school was established for the benefit of Navajo
Indians on the Western part of thereservation.
It has not been
in operation long enough nor had a fair trial, so it would befim
possible to tell what the outlook is.
The location is said to
be a good one for healthfullness and may I think, under good super
intendency be productive of considerable good.
