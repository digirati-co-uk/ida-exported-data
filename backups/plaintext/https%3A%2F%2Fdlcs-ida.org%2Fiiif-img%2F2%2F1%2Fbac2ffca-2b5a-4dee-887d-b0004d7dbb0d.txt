WebsterYes Webster thats our nameWe' re famous for speech and debateWe' re smart, most all brain,..Our meetings we attend and never are late.Girls are not smart enough, you seeA genuine Websterite to be.So we' re all stags you know,With bright ideas, that never end low.Now there' s the Minnehaha bunch,Without a bit of that stuff, punch.Their colors I think, are Purple and WhiteThat fly high like a tailess kite.It makes us Websters laughtTo hear them try to debateAnd talk on subjects such as" wrath',And others I fail to enumerate.Then there are the Louisa M. AlcottsThey think they' re' it' to the dots.However thats pretty good for tots,But they can' t pronounce obnosticotts.Last of all, there' s the LincolnsWith their colors of Red and Blue.At their meetings, they' re winking and blinking,But they are of the right stuff and true.Our sister is Miss Minnehaha;Our first cousin Miss Louisa M. A;Our second cousin is Master Lincoln ha! ha!We' re Daniel Webster' s No. 1 A.Our colors are of a gorgeous hueTo which each one is true.Purple and Orange, aren' t they grand?“ Yoa bet ” and behind it is our noble band.T.
