2.OF INDIAN ASSE RECEIVINDEREcir.# 433JUL 6- 191010EDUCATION DIVISION.-- HEALTH SECTION.1.The general health conditions at school and agency areexcellent, there has been very little sickness of any kind,There no diseases prevalent among thesepeople that I haveany knowledge of.( a) The physician from St. Ysabel visited us in March and reportX fXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ed one case of tuberculosis, or threatenedwith tuberculosis from exposure.( 8) He reported that the children had trachoma in mila form,though I have never seen a school with better vision, or less inflamation of eyes.( c) We have an epidemic of whooping cough and one of La Grippewithin the last year, but each ran its course with, serious results,and without treatment by physician.( a) I know of no other forms of disease among these people.3.- The sanitary condition of the buildings at the school isgood, good water, proper ventilation, all openings screened, thesewers kept clean and disinfected with quick lime.At the homes there is need of improvement. They have mostlydirt floors, few of them have glass windows, none have screens,but in surmer they build brush houses and live in the open a greatdeal of the time.4.- As there has been very little occasion, therehas not beenmuch work done, except in an advisory manner, insisting on cleanliness and plenty of fresh air. No difficulties encountered.5.- It is hardly possible for the physician at st Ysabel to coverthis jurisdiction. It seems necessary to employ a local physician incases of emergency.OM
