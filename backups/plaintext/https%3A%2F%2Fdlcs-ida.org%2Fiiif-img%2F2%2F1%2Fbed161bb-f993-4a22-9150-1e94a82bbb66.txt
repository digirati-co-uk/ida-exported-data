One tuberculosis case has been sent to ahospital.( a) I would not recommend the establishment of atent hospital at this agency.( e) There is a hospital at Albuquerque which israther a temporary affair and in a rented building.I have been in hopes that the Office would convertthe Southern Pueblos Agency building into a hospital,build a cottage for the physician on the same lot,and find other quarters for the agency. This wouldgive the Southern and the Northern Pueblos a jointhospital and would be full all of the time. Thephysician should be quartered near by.4.( a) At the present time there is only one venereal casebeing treated at this agency to my knowledge.( b) This case is being regularly treated by thelocal contract physician in this city.
