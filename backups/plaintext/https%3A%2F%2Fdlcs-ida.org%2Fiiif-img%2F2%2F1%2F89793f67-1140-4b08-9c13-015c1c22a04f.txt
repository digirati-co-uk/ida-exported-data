for the pumpo: s for Wich it was built. Om August 18, 1899
miated for$ 1500.00 to strengthen and repair this building: cope:
tion of the building is such that
to stand the jar of the machinery
and make sosu would cost more than to build an entirely new one- sto.
ry building to be used as a Laundry. t now think that the wisest oorse
would be
to build such a building and use the present and for mare
room and share,
au mondels entirety tomo
sman for the purpose. The Hospital is a first- class building but in
100 ninished in the upper st√∏ry, cach will cost$ 355.00 to vyake
completa. Piazus ber the unsevpre tipors around the subidang
were estimated for last August at a cost of$ 1500.00. These are very
necessary, not only to proteat the floors but as a great ponvenience
to the school. The remainder of the buildings are and will be satis
factory for some time.
The present proper capacity of the school
is one hundred and fifty, but during the current year I have crowded
in an average of two hundred and four attempting to satisfy the de
sands of the
children of school age about here. There have bee's two
hundred and firty seven
enrollen during the year, with the average
attendance furt named. There are one hundred and six acrme in the
school far,
The facilities for industrial training are in vno
lines of farming, onre of stock, trees and flowers, carpentering,
shoemaking, placksmithing to a small extent, tailorins, bakins, COOK
ins, sevias, housekeeping and cleaning and nursing the sick.
The water supply is good and is at present furnished for danestic use
