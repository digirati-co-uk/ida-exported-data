It is rather startling that there16 not one of the allotments of 160 acros that an Indian canmake a living upon il confined within the limits of the allotment.Heirship is determined as far as possible fromthe allotment rolls, whioh are very incomplete.Owing to the large area in which these Indians live,and thier nomadic habits, it has been impossible to get full reports of births and deaths.No individual Indian money has come into our hands.VeryStachur:Superintendent
