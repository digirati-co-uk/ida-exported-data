Dear Sir:-
It becomes my painful duty to report to you the accidental
death of Juan Baptisto Vijil, age 15, a. pupil of this school, who came
here from the Pueblo of Nambe, and was enrolled on October 19,1898,
His death occured at 4 o'clock pomo Monday December 12, 1898, by
the accidental discharge of a gun in the hands of a room mate, James
Gorman, a Navajo Indian boy.
Justice Miguel Goryan was immediately notified of the accident,
and a jury was summoned by him and met at the school the same evening
Dec. 12, '98., and after hearing all the evidence in the case, decided
that the shooting was accidental.
A messenger was dispatched immediately after the accident to the
Pueblo of Nambe to acquaint the boys relatives with thi circumstances,
and upon their request the body was sent with school team and escorts
to the Nambe Pueblo for burial.
Very respectfully,
Home
Superintendbnl.
