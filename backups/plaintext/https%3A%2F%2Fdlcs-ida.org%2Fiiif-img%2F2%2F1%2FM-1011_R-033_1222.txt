1930.NARRATI VE SECTIONINDUSTRIES,Contid.EASTERN NAVAJO JURISDICTION.at nearly every meeting of the Stock Organizations urging that theIndians receive no more land. The State Legislature emphasizes thesituation and memorializes Congress to stop giving aid to the Indians in this respect. Further, there are several thousand entitledto allotments in New Mexico. Provisions are made for funds to carryout the work of allotment, but is permitted to be specified that noneof this money is to be used for allotment work among the Indians ofArizona and New Mexico.The Indians in every case select seed corn from the best thatthey grow and it is doubtful if there is any variety better adaptedfor desert planting than the Indian Calico Corn.Dry farming results vary according to season. Many did notplant anything this year as there was practically no moisture atthe planting season. Beans, squash, corn and melons are the maincrops.Each year there are more and better homes constructed, and thisfeature should be put forward thru the thirteen chapters now organized among the Indians, tho this year their efforts were confined tothe construction of dipping plants, road building, bridges, diggingof more wells and spring development. Some use is being made fromReimbursable funds for livestock only, sheep and goats, and paymentsare usually in arrears and collections have been below former yearson account of the bad season, and the necessity to purchase feed andsubsistence for themselves and stock and to be paid for from reducedrevenue from the herds. Blanket weaving is at a standstill, andsome of the large wholesale houses have for a time stopped buying asthe demand for them has slackened, due to the high prices asked bythe Indians and traders for them.The Indians use their allotments to the fullest extent forgrazing purposes and there is not any open range which they occupyor use in reserve.Every year there is a greater number of returned students, andwe are entirely unable to provide employment to all who want workand there are not enough jobs near the Indian Country to supply them.Therefore, an Employment Bure au should be established near here thatthe matter of finding employment for the returned students, bothyoung men and women, be solved. This would be the medium betweenCapital and Labor and would fill a long felt want. Some peoplethink and express themselves that the education of the InƒÅian girlsand placing them in homes are the means of solving the domestic situation, but I hardly agree that it is the purpose of Indian educationto educate with the idea of solving the white peoples' difficultiesin this respect.
