General.During the past year the Red Lake country in the northwestern part of the Hopi reservation, former under the jurisdiction of the Wester Navajo agency, was added to our territoryand placed definitely under the jurisdiction of the Hopisuperintendent. This has added a great deal of extra workfor this agency and especially in the supervision of stockmatters. Owing to this addition, it will be necessary forthis agency to have another stockman's position establishedand a sheep dipping vat built near Red Lake. The Indians aredemanding this. They have never had the attention that theyshould have had and we are taking this matter up now in specialcommunications to the Indian Office with the end in view ofproperly caring for this additional territory and the Indiansliving therein.During the past year there has been considerable argumentpro and con in regard to the supposed difficulties arisingbetween the Hopis and Nava jos on the Hopi reservation. Duringthe past year there has been no trouble of any kind along thisline and we have not been bothered with any trouble at allbetween the tribes. As heretofore reported, we believeconsiderable of this trouble originated before at the dippingvats and this is now eliminated by the building of two additionalvats in Navajo territory for the exclusive use of the Nava jos.So far as I am able to judge, I feel that the Hopis and Navajosare intermingling and getting along better each year. I seemore of them together each year. I see more Hopis buildingamong the Navajos each year and associating with them so faras stock interests go. This is a very favorable and encouragingcondition.This report should not be ended without this agency assuringthe Office of its appreciation of the patience and assistanceThisextended it by the Indian Office through the fiscal year.attitude by the office has been of valuable assistance to us.Respectfully submitted,Mielu1Edgar K.
