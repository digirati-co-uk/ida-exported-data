The school has taken care of 25 pupils more than its appropri
ation called for which shows an actual saving, if it is
desired to figure it that way, of$ 5, 000.
A number of Navajo and Zuni children
applied for admission
late in the year after the enrollment
had passed far beyond
the number for which appropriation
had been made. It became
necessary
to refuse to accept these pupils.
The plant consists of 43 brick, cement, frame and adobe
buildings
all of which are in a fair state of repair. Eleven
buildings
are heated by individual
hot water and steam plants.
The others are heated by stoves which is unsatisfactory
and
dangerous
in any institution
caring for children, especially
in an institution
like this where there are old frame buildings.
It is hoped that an appropriation
will be made to cover the
installation
of a central heating plant. A central heating
plant is greatly needed for economy, comfort, and safety.
The new auditorium
and gymnasium building
is now nearing
completion. This is a fine brick structure, larger and better
planned than the one destroyed
by fire last year. This
building is large enough to meet the future requirements of
the school. It' s actual cost to the Government
is$ 42, 500. 00.

work, carpentry, plumbing, heating, and painting
were done by the school details as well as the delivering of
