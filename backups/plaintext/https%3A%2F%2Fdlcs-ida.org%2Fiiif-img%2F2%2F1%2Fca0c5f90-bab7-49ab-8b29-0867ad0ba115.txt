It is the fault of no one, they simply cannot avoid it,.4I would recommend that this apology of a wareroom, be torn down, and theAgent be instructed to build a new Adobe building, in a suitable locality,To apust.may golarge enough to meet the needs of the school.The present warehouse is not only a very poor building, but is too small,and badly located.The Boys dormitory, carpenter shopused by the boys, and the warehouse3are all frame buildings, and although independent, are so near eachother that in case of fire all would burn. A fire wonld be 11ableto burn all the school buildings.The Boys work shop is good enough, but it should be moved from its presenlocation, f√ºrther back.The Kitchen, needs a new and larger range, the one now in use is allburned out, and is too small.The reason I recommend Adobe being used in constructing new buildings,at this school is, that the large boys of the school, can make theAdobe brick, and it would be good instruction for them; the cost ofmaking such buildings would be small, it is the best building matirialthe country affords, and what Indian boys must use when constructingbuildings for themselves.The school room furniture consists of thirty[ 30] single desks, in fairrepair, an Organ, Teachers desk, Globe with ample maps charts,and blackboards.This is a bright cheerful room.
