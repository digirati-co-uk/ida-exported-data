Annual Report
1917.
San Juan School& Agency.
During the year cottages for the use of district farmers
were partially completed at Red Rock about thirty- five miles due
west of the agency and at a point near Tocito about forty miles
south.
There has been a farm station at Aneth fifty- five miles
northwest of Shiprock for a number of years.
Another farm station
should be established in the near future at Teeceno spas, which is
about thirty miles northwest of here to take care of a large
farming area in the foothills of the Carriso Mountains.
Two additional physicians should be provided immediately.
One should be stationed at Tocito, the other at Aneth. Two
moderate sized hospitals should be established at these two
points. The interest of the Indians in our health campaign
would materially increase, if this suggestion is carried out.
Progress was made during the year towards the completion
of the new agency hospital. The heating plant was installed,
and most of the plumbing is in place. The lighting plant
should be installed as soon as possible, when the hospital
can be put in use.
