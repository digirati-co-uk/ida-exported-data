g-6Law& Order( Continued)Hopi Indian AgencyIt is the consensus of opinion among Indian Service workers thatMat ional Prohibition has made for worse conditions amode our Indians,so far as the introduction of home- made brew and booze is concerned.As with the whites, everywhere there seems to be more Indians drinkingnow then ever before.I do not see the use of drugs among the Indians of either tribe onthis reservation.As I have said above, I know of no home- brew or booze of any kindwhatever being made by members of either tribe, either for sale or homeconsumption.The law mekdng it an offense for an Indian having liquor in his posession has been a vast and material assistance to officers trying to preventunlawful introduction of liquor on all reservations.Gambling probably is the very worst practice or crime, if you can callit that, which these Indians practice. Gambling is a permanent feature ofthe home life of both the Hopis and Navajos, especially among the Navajos.They gamble all hours of the day and night in many forms. The most prominent form: I find is the Mexican cards.Every native policeman and the Special Officer is under strict ordersto prevent gambling in every possible way. But here again, we are metwith the great handicap of having no authority back of us to prosecuto orto give merited punishment for those gambling. We destroy every factor inthe pay of equipment and where the offense morits it, we issue punishmentin the way of giving them 30 days on the rock pile or similar sentences.Without adequate and proper laws to stop this practice, it will contimeto be a prominent part of the amusement of these people. I would say her.though, that those people only gamble for amusement and that the stakesare not largo, the loss of which would not cause suffering or tant amongthose adictod to the habit. We have a few professional gamblers.So far as I know, there has been no important decision during thepast fiscal yar either by State or Federal Courts affecting our Indians,either in criminal, civil or equity matters.So far as I know, there was no new legisla ti on enacted by Arizonaduring the past year involving liquor traffic among Indians.Respectfully submgtted.gal Thulin,EO: WVEdgar K.
