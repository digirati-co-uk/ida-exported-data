When necessary, special diet, an afternoon rest period in the dormitory, and temporary changes induty, were ordered and frequently worked wonders.Each employee has cooperated with the school physicianin every way possible. Employees were encouraged to sendchildren to the hospital for observation and study when anyunusual condition existed. In this way, we were able to prevent some cases of serious illness and a prolonged absencefrom the clossroom. This precaution is necessary in view ofthe fact that there is a large surrounding native populationand danger of infectious and contagious diseases.SUTTO
