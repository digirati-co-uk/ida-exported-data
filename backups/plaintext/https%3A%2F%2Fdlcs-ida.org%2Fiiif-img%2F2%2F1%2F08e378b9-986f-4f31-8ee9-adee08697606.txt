â€¢ Narrative-
Section II
... Health.
All pupils were given a thorough physical examinationa
at the beginning of the school year and weekly inspections
were maintained throughout the year. The last of each month
the students were required to weigh themselves and to compare
their weights with that of a normal child of the same age as
tabulated on the standard of weights.
The weighing has been
done in the classrooms under the supervision of a teacher
and a list of all children under weight has been sent to the
physician for study. When necessary, special diet, an after
noon rest period in the dormitory, and temporary changes in
duty, were ordered and frequently worked wonders.
Each employee has cooperated with the school physician
in every way possible. Employees were encouraged to send
children to the hospital for observation and study when any
unusual condition existed. In this way, we were able to pre
vent some cases of serious illness and a prolonged absence
from the clossroom. This precaution is necessary in view of
the fact that there is a large surrounding native population
and danger of infectious and contagious diseases.
