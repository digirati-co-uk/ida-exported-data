got throughthe year in pretty goodshape.Thiry- eight per cent of our pupilswere foundpositive.We did no operativetreatmentGot good resultswith a relentlesscampaignof medicationI am inclinedto be a littleskepticalabout too much operativetreatmentWe had no epidemicsof any kind this schoolyear. A few cases of mumps appearedand a littlechickenpox, but nothingcameof themso that aside from whatcases of trachomaand tuberculosiswe had, there was nothingmuchin the way of sickness.We have a hospital- a ratherantiquatedone, which I am planningto replacewith a new one in the relativelynear future, the presentone beinginadequate, not up todate, and poorly, or incorrectly, situatedwith referenceto the other buildingson the schoolpremises, it beingin the near vicinityof that part of the groundswhere thereis thegreatestamountof hubbuband continualcome and go onthe part of the pupils. So that it is situatedwherethere is the maximmmamountof noise.I plan settingmy proposednew hospitalawayoff at the eastend ofthe schoolgrounds, wherethere is no noiseat all andno come and go.Just at presentno additionalemployeesare neededto do the healthwork at thisschool. However,as per recentcorrespondencewith the IndianOfficeon the subjectof the proposednew hospital, I am planningto make that new hospitalfunctionnot only as a hospitalfor the pupilsof this schoolbut also as a sort of base hospitalfor all of the Indiansof the NorthernPueblos. And whenthat is done, if thatplan is approvedand put into effect, thenwe shall certainlyneed at leastone more full- time nurseNRHP Rangers managementare representsmanagementmemories
