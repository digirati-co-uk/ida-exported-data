We finished working on the skins, and brought them up
to the Hogan. The boys said that they were tired of working
on the skins.
We had talked about how we might have some flowers or
a garden near our hogan. Several suggestions
were given.
Some thought that we would have to fence the garden in, as
the children
might spoil it. Marcelino
suggested
that
WO
might make some boxes, and put in the windows.
So three of
the boys went to the Carpenter
Shop for boards, Marcelino
had measured
the space outside our windows to bee how large
they should be. They brought them to the Hogan, and nailed
them together. They were ready for the dirt or soil.

Ben came in," Summer all gone, winter is here, freeze
again."
Roy," Maybe selfish giant around the Hogan, the
reason we have winter." I had read the story of the Selfish
Giant" the day before, At least it was too cold to fix the
flower boxes.
We decided that it would be nice to make some Health
Booklets
to take home with them. We spent quite a time print
ing the name on the cover," My Health Book."

book, and the things we wished to remember to do. Andy sug
gested that we make a Hogan for the first page. We called
1t the Health Hogan" or some called the one they made a" Clean
Hogan."
