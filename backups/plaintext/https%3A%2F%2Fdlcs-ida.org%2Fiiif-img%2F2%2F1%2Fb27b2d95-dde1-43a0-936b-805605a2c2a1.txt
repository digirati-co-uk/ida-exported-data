May 1,We finished working on the skins, and brought them upto the Hogan. The boys said that they were tired of workingon the skins.We had talked about how we might have some flowers ora garden near our hogan. Several suggestionswere given.Some thought that we would have to fence the garden in, asthe childrenmight spoil it. MarcelinosuggestedthatWOmight make some boxes, and put in the windows.So three ofthe boys went to the CarpenterShop for boards, Marcelinohad measuredthe space outside our windows to bee how largethey should be. They brought them to the Hogan, and nailedthem together. They were ready for the dirt or soil.May2,Ben came in," Summer all gone, winter is here, freezeagain."Roy," Maybe selfish giant around the Hogan, thereason we have winter." I had read the story of the SelfishGiant" the day before, At least it was too cold to fix theflower boxes.We decided that it would be nice to make some HealthBookletsto take home with them. We spent quite a time printing the name on the cover," My Health Book.",May 3,We talked about what would be nice to put in our healthbook, and the things we wished to remember to do. Andy suggested that we make a Hogan for the first page. We called1t the Health Hogan" or some called the one they made a" CleanHogan."
