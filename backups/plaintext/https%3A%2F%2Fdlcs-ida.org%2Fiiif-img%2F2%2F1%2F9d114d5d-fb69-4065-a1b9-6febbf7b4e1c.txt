HANNAHTRUJILLO2011HOMECOMINGQUEENomecoming was a greatweek for everybody fullof memories we' ll alwaysremember. Participating inthe court races was a one ofa kind experience from thetalent show to the themed days but most of allthe nerve wracking voting day! I would just liketo thank you, SFIS, for electing me in as yourHomecoming Queen. It was a privilege. Nextyear I hope that the homecoming court remainsrole models to the school community and thatit is ten times what it was this year. Make it ablast!HOMECOMINGROYALTY
