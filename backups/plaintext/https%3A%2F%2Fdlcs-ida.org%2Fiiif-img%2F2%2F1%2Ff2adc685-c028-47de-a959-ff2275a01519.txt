ANNUAL RI
RT, 1926.
Narrative.
Sohools.
Pueblo Bonito.
As heretofor reported public schools are not within
roach of the lava hos and will probably be a long time
beforo suoh advantage is at their dispogal. The Indians
are very much in favor of sohaols, and want their childron to
attond the resrvation schools and are emphatio that they bo
not transforrod under the 6th grade. They are positively not
in accord with the gending away of little childron as is now
preotiood and at the meeting of the Council last July
Yo solutiong mere adopted against this polley. Not satisfied
Lod
with this resolution they aro 880retly oollooting money to
dofray expenses to Washington in further protest to the
Superintendents sending children to non- f@ se rvation' schools,
under the grade mentioned.
In my opinion we will get better cooperation 11 their
wishes are given more consideration than has been done the
past few years, it is no pleasant siustion for one to be in
when parents come and beg you to not send their little
children away but to let them remain here.
In past years this sohool has done some very good
work in the ole 88 rooms but the past year seems to have been
our best as our teachers, thru better training and close
cooperation, attained results that were very gratifying to me.
The coming year the Boarding school plant van
easily accomoda te 350 children. Ã˜t is a disappointment
that the Chas.Burke School could not have been ready for
children at the opening of the coming sohool year.
