O( 11)into these new Indian officials the necessityto recognize and obeythe orders and regulationsof the precedingyear.This businesswill continuo 80 long as these comic- opera governors and theirretinue of mayordomos and cagiques, are recognizedas having even" internal" authority.Up to this time, the decisions of theUnited States Courts have recognized something termed as" internalaffairs;" but what does this mean? Along the lines of common senseand justice I have endeavored to definitely separate the" internalaffairs of the Pueblos" from the general jurisdictionof the IndianAgent and his Indian Courts under Departmentalregulati ons." Internal affairs" makes& fine sound in a court decision;butnoone can define this term in all its Indian peculiarities.TheIndian agents who have had charge of these people, however, very wellknow the possible expansion of this cloak, and what it may be usedto cover.It is idle to recommend a policy with respect to the Indianreligious" dances" and ceremonies;because Indian agents have beensuggesting and recommending concerning this matter for the pasttwentyyears.Nothing in the way of cleansing can be done until thefantastic term" internal affairs" has been exploded;and thismaynot be done until Congress enacts legislationdefining the statusof the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico.This general statement applies to most things connected withlaw and order.
