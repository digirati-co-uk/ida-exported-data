Dear Sir:
I kerew: th enclose copies of ei realars that I have sent out
since assuming charge of the day sohools in this vicinity.
They are not sent for the purpose of instructing you un any points,
so please don' t construe me in that way, but to let you know
some thing of what I am trying to do. I find that the es reuiar
sent to day school teachers about reporting children for next
year is going to bring good results. In to- day' s mati I heard from
two of my teachers, and both of them reported good cleases for
next year.
Mi sa M. B. Dissette, as you know, will be as much your on
ployee as mine, tho' I am to pay her, and carry her on my rolls.
She will spend about half of her time in your field, and when
so occupied, will as I understand matters, be under your control.
I hope we may be able to work along the same lines, and be
of assistance to each other. You are cordially invited to come
azid see me.
