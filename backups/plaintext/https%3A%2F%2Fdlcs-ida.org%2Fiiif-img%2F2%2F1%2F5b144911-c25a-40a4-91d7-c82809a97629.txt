0-17Knowledge concerning the' dry sand is of value inproperly completingthe well so that there will be no esca peof oil undergroundinto sandy horizons which would veryreadily take up considerableamounts of the light oil. Ithas been found that when all pipe connectionsand casingjoints are screwed up to the very last thread, the oilstill leaks through to some extent. A large loss of oilmight result from indifferencetoward the proper completionof each well.The wells drilledin Hogback have a closed in pressureof approximately205 pounds to the square inch, As beforementioned, there is no gas present and the wells flow dueto water pressure back of the oil. The wells are not ofthe gusher type, consequently, and the oil comes to thesurface and gently flows over the top of the casing. Therecoveryof oil not being dependentupon any gas pressure,which would be depreciable, leads the writer to the beliefthat a high recovery may be looked for.STATUS OF MIDWEST WELLS DRILLEDIN HOGBACK.WELLNO.LOCATIONTOP OF SAND TOTAL DEPTHPRODUCTION1NE; 19-29-167729882NVA 19-29-16785795375 bbls.oilcem.off and made testwell.
