Section V
Allotments
Jicarilla
Agency
New itexico
Following Executive Order of February 11,
1887
,
setting apart the Jicarilla Indian reservation
129, 313.35 acres were allotted to 845 Indians.
An
excessive
death rate and difficulty
confronting
recognition and identification
of living allottees
led to cancellation
of these allotments and the Act
of March 4, 1907, authorized
the cancellation
and the
re- allotment
with timber
to be left as tribal property
during the trust patent period.
Sale of
timer therefore
gives returns as tribal funds during term of trust patent
and for a period of twentyfive
years on surplus lands.
Agricultural
allotments were limited to two and onehall
to ten acres and grazing allotinents
range from one hundred
sixty to four hundred acres, Tifty two per cent of the
allottees
of the roll approved in August 1909 have died
and there is very large number of children who have no
allotinents.
Utilization
of grazing
lands for the sheep
and the agricultural
lands for the production
of supple
mental forage and grains have awakened
the Indians
to a
higher appreciation
of their reservation
