will be built up almost entirely on experiences and activities of the community.
Vocational and Industrial training will be stressed. The elimination of un
necessary academic subjects will be gradually undertaken. It is felt that the
transition from the old type of Indian Education to the new should be gradual
to overcome the opposition of the returned students who are naturally acquainted
with and in favor of the Boarding School program.
Considerable experimentation will be necessary to produce a workable
course of study for community centers and the performance of these experiments
will naturally interest the Navajo people in new educational procedure and when
the new course of study is ready to be put in operation in its entirety it is
felt the Navajo people will readily accept it.
Respectfully submitted,
Eameday
E. R. McCray, Superintendent,
Northern Navajo Indian Agency.
