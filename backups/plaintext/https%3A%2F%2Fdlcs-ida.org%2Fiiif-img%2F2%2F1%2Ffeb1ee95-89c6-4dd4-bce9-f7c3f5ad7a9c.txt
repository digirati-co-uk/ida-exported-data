dis
crepancies
in the annual statistical
report, I wish to advise

we only have on hand at the present time birth and death
certificates
for 174 births and 117 deaths, We will make
arrangements
to have the other birth and death certificates
made up in this office and submit them to you as soon as
possible,
In reference
to the examinations
for tuberculosis
and
trachoma, while we have more school children in this juris
diction than call for examination
, we only have 607 attend
ing the day schools, the others being in non- reservation
boarding and mission schools over which we have no juris
diction
.
Respectfully
yours,
Hem A Jowers
