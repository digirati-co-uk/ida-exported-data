Considerable difficulty is experienced in maintain
ing order upon the Pueblo grants because of the uncertainty
of the jurisdiction of the Federal or State courts.

unequivocally to the Federal Courts in major offenses.
I would like to outline the needed legislation with the
assistance of the United States Attorney and with him
explain it to the Indian Committees of the House and
Senate.
