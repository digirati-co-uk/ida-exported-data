Santa Fe, N. M.
Msdam:-
I am advised by letter from the Indian orfise under date
of June 15th, as follows:
" In reply you are advised that so much of offteg beter-
ferred to, to the Supervising teacher, giving her anthem ty to
correspond officially with teachers direct and to visit the
Schools at each times as she may see fit and proper, is revoked,
and on the authority of this letter you will say to
ing Teacher that after a more ma ture consideration of the matter
it does not seem necessary that she should correspond directly
in an official way with these teachers. Official corresponde
shouli, as required by the regulations, be forwarded through
you, the responsible head of these schools. There is no objeg
however, to her writing letters to these people officially
if the same are forwarded through you. It is presumed that the
Supervising Teacher will visit the various schools at gugh times
as they appear right and proper to her, al ways with the proviso that
you have the supervision and direction to send her at such times
and to such places as in your judgement should be inspected by
the Supervising Teacher.
On her visits to these teachers she can talk to theith in an
official way, doing Bway with the necessity for official 00
respondence, because no action can be taken upon her pfriotal
correspondence unless the same is approved by you."
The above explains itself clearly, and so far as I know,
settles the only question between uso
Very respeertally,
Superintendent
