The sentiment of the community is against the intermingling
of races, We have no mixed marriages among the Indians of this
jurisdiction.
The totali expenses for all pupils during the current fiscal
year were about the same as the preceding year, Somewhat less was
expended on the purchase of Annual Estimate supplies, more was ex
pended in the construction of buildings..
O od use is made of play- ground apparatus, more benefit is
derived from this than any other means of recreation about the
school.
( a) Systematic. supervision is given over all play- ground
activities,
( b) The girls use the slides and swings, they take part
in group garnes on the campus and in sociables held in the build
ing. They play basket ball to some extent. They are given sitting
up exercises. However, they do not take to athletics as much as they
do outside of the Pueblo.
It will be necessary in my opinion to continue Government
schools at this jurisdiction for many years/ This Reservation was
one of the last to be provided with school facilities.. It is far
from a settled country and will have no chance of being benefitted
by attendance at district schools. This is due to the barren un
productive country in which we are located.
