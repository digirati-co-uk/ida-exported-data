OCTORABIE SIDE OF THE TIWATIVE CURRIQ LUNIAs a new teacher working with non- English speaking children forthe first time I found the tentative curriculum very helpful. Eachsuggestion appears to have been tried before and proven satisfactory.The objectives corresponding to the activities were practical, interesting to the children and met with the needs of the Navajos.I liked especially the stress laid on two important objectives,Health and language.If during the years the children are in schoolthey learn to understand and speak English well, and learn to livea clean healthy life, then they are prepared to cope with many of thedifficult problems which confronts them on the reservation.Of course other activities are vitally necessary such as: Vocation,which teaches the Navajo to make things to help him live an easierand more comfortable life.Equally as important is the need for culture, character training,citizenship and homemembership.I feel that the Major Tields of Life Activities are those workedout in the Tenative Curriculum.The activities are within the ability of the children.They areof such wide variety and so flexible that they blend into almostany Unit the class might wish to undertake,
