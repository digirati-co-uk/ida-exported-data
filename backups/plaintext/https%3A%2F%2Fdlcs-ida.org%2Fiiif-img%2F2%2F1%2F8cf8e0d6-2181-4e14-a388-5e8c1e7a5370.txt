O
CTORABIE SIDE OF THE TIWATIVE CURRIQ LUNI
As a new teacher working with non- English speaking children for
the first time I found the tentative curriculum very helpful. Each
suggestion appears to have been tried before and proven satisfactory.

I liked especially the stress laid on two important objectives,
Health and language.
If during the years the children are in school
they learn to understand and speak English well, and learn to live
a clean healthy life, then they are prepared to cope with many of the
difficult problems which confronts them on the reservation.

which teaches the Navajo to make things to help him live an easier
and more comfortable life.

citizenship and homemembership.
