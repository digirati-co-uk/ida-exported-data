a. Name of each chapter or other organization, with number
of members in each:
Chapter or clan organizations are century old among the Pueblos, and while
they give little publicity to the purpose, membership, etc. yet one can readily
note leadership among them and strength and efficiency of organization, which
perhaps accounts primarily for connnendable approach and self- supporting status
for centuries past. Their industries of whatever line have organized direction
and collectively and indiviêually there is definite proceedure, so definite
indeed that to all productive effort within the pueblo there attaches community,
moral and religious obligation and devotion. Their success in organization
should call for our study and understanding, but of necessity taking time,
patience and sympathetic understanding.
