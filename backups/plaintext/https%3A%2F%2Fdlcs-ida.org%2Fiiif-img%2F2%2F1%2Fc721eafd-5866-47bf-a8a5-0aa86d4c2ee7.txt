De Sir:
It has been reported
to me that the past season a small green
hug did considerable
damage
to the crops of wheat at the Indian Pueblos
Janez and Zis, at Che last place destroying
the entire crop.
I would
e me pleased if the agricultural
facultycould
give me any information
about the insects
injurious
to growing grain which infest this region,
and about the method
of combating
them.
The weat orop 19 of great importanco
to theso Indians, and their lot
would be a hard one in the territory would become so infested as to make
1 Erowing of wheat impossible.
A personal investigation
by an expert
Dom your school night be necease to deterinine the best methods.
Very respectfully
,
Brand
Superintendent.
