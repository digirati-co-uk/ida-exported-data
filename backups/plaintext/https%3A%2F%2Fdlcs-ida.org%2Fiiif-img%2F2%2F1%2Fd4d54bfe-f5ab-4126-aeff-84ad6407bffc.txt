There were no seizures of liquor to my knowledge.3. No confiscation of articles for introducing liquor.COMMENTS.The Territorial officials are efficient and have cooperated in every way possible in the suppression of the liquortraffic among the Indiens. The work of Special Officers of theDepartment in this section has been very weak. An efficient andresponsible Special Officer would find a great deal to do inNew Mexico in securing evidence of the sale of liquor to theIndians against the United Slates and Territorial statutes. Ihave had but little or no time to devote to the suppression ofthe liq or traffic. The Laguna and Acoma Indians drink some andhave no trouble in securing liquor at Cubero, New Mexico, theCanon Cito Navajos get liquor at the same place, and the Isletasand San Dia Indians get liquor at Bernalillo. The San Felipesand Santa Ana Indians do not drink.- 11
