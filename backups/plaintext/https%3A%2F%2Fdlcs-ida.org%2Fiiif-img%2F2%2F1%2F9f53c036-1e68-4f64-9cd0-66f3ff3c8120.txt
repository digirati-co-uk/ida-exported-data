( 33)averaging less than$ 25 each, for individual benefit or waste.Each new Isleta' Governor makeg an effort to control these monies.But there are about fifty progressive men at Isleta, representing lessthan one- third of the population.These men have stood with theSuperintendent, a small minority opposing a most contentious andunreasonable majority. I wish to mention particularly Mr. Pablo Abeita( Indian Judge and interpreter) Mr. Bautista Zuni, J.Felipe Abeita,Frank Lucero, and others of this group, who have supported the lasttwo superintendents, although life has been made miserable for themat the Pueblo because of their progressive attitude.This is writtenas an illustration of the Pueblo situation generally, save that mostother Pueblos promptly expend the little monies they receive.Laguna has several thousands of dollars in Liberty Bonds and a smallchecking account, subject to the direction of their Indian officials.Cochiti is now wrangling about$ 1500, which the Superintendent anda few intelligent progressives hope to conserve as a banking account( see revised Cochiti- Rio Grande Boom contract).
