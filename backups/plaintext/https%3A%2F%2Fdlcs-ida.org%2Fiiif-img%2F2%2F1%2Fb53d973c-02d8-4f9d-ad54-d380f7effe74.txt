Every morning during breakfast at thehotel we were expected to read the dailynewspaper which would be used to discussissues on the bus while traveling. The firstactivity for each morning and afternoonwould be to attend seminars to listen to guestspeakers address their concerns and thenhave us give questions and comments. Wealso took in all the sights of the monuments.The place that most of us were so excitedabout was the Hard Rock Cafe. I had a goodtime because the food was great. It was filledwith guitars, pictures, signs, and a lot offamous singers' gold records and outfits theyperformed in.The first people that we met were ourroommates, there were four to a room.
