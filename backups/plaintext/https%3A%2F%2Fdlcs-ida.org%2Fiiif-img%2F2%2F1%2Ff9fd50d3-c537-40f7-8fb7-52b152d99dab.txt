3Santa Fe, N., July 28, 1924,-14Abouta year ago I attendeda conferencein Albuquerque, at whichwere presentthe representativesof the Bureauof AnimalIndustryof the state, and the state SanitaryBoard, at which this doureenmatterand the dippingofthe Nava jo sheep for scabieswas fully discussed,This conference, I am sure, resultedthereafterin a muchbettercooperationbetweenthe Bureauof AnimalIndustryand the employeesof the Indianofficethan had hitherto obtained. I foundrecentlyon a trip throughthe westernNaya jo jurisdictionthat the doureenwork was well underway, but that becauseof a slightshortagein funds muchof the effectivenessof the work alreadydone would be lost becausethe re- actorscould not be gatheredanddisposedof.It is now my understandingthat there is availablea matterof 10,000.00for the use of the superintendentsof the Tuba City and WestemTava jo jurisdictionsincarryingon doureeneradicationactivitiesduringthepresentfiscalyear. Therewas on hand on July 16thapproximately170 head of known doureenreactinghorsesto be destroyed, at an averagepriceof$ 25,00per head. The sum of 34250,00will be requiredfor indersificationof ownerson the destructionof these horses. Approximatelyan additional$ 500 will be requiredto defraylabor expensein connectionwith the apprehensionon therange of the above mentionednumberof affectedhorses.Owingto the fact that considerableminglingofaffectedhorseswith healthystock has resultedsincethe discontinuationof testingwork in the WesternNava jo jurisdictionduringthe early portionof June, it willbecomenecessary, in orderto completeeffectivelythework in that section, to age in cover the entireterritory. To completea test of the necessaryhorsesinthe westernJava jo jurisdiction, it is estimatedthatapproximately$ 5,000 will be requiredto defraytheexpenseof operation. No less, probably, than 140 headof additionalreactinghorses will be discovered.pay for these horseswhen destroyed, there will be requiredan averageof$ 25,00 per head, or 3500,00,If destroyedimmediatelywhen found it would not cost anexcessof$ 250.00 to gatherthese horses.From thisit appearsthat the sum of 13,500will be requiredforthe completetestingof the WesternHava jo area and thedestructionof existingreactorsand affectedhorseswhich may later be found.
