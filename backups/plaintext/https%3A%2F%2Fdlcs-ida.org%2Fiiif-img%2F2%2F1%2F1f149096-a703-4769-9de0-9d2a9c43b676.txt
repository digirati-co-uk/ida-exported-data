RickieVigilI would like to thank everyone that helped me get to whereI am now. I really enjoyed my years here at SFIS and I amdefinitely going to miss it. I am going to miss the staff and allmy friends, especially Alana Owen and AnnaMae Martinez. Youguys stuck by my side through the good and crazy times. I wantto thank my parents Ricky Vigil and Nicole Archuleta for beingmy biggest support system! These 6 years went by fast, but Iwill never forget them. Thank you all!Rickie VigilShanyaWhitehorse“ These people who contributed to who I am, they are withme wherever I go, and as history gets rewritten in small wayswith each passing day, my love for them only grows. Becausethe truth is... it was the best times. Mistakes were made,hearts were broken, harsh lessons learned, but all of that hasreceded into fond memory now. How does it happen? Whyare we so quick to forget the bad and romanticize the good?Maybe it is because we need to believe that the time wespent together actually meant something, that we were therefor each other at a time in our lives that defined us all, a timein our lives that we will never forget. I can' t swear this is exactly how it happened. But this is how it felt. ” – Joey PotterRemember to always DREAM BIG!Shanya WhitehorseJordanAguilar97
