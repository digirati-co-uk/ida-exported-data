The Santa Fe Indian School has established itself as a flagship school in Indian Education,
ting what is possible to achieve with self- determination. It is a unique place with
special values, beliefs, and codes of behavior, which are needed to promote and protect this
uniqueness. Each member of the Santa Fe Indian School community has a responsibility to
support and maintain good school spirit, which is based, in large part, on trust and respect
for one another. Good school spirit also comes from recognizing that the needs of the group
are sometimes more important than the needs of any one person within the group. Humility,
service, honesty, respect, and cooperation are some of the most important values reflected in
the spirit of the Santa Fe Indian School.
The school' s success is the result of local control, which demands a high degree of parent
and community involvement. Santa Fe Indian School has received numerous national
awards. Some of the reasons for the school' s success are less tangible. Students mention a
sense of belonging, a caring environment, and a place where parents and students feel at
home. As one student commented, â€œ... the difference is that teachers really teach and the staff
really cares..."

Because of the efforts of the school' s leadership, the future for the Indian education at the
Santa Fe Indian School looks even brighter than the glowing achievements of its past. Our
students are living in beautiful new dormitories, and attend classes in brand new Humanities
and Fine and Pratical Arts buildings. It has been a most exciting experience to share the
beginning of a new tradition, in a revitalized school filled with pride and confidence.
