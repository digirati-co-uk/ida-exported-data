UEBLO DE SANTA CLAR16, 899. 15. The aresurveyed by the Cadastral Engineerand containing 16, 899. 15 acre, is confirmed by this Board.For the purpose of thisreport, the Grant so patented andconfirmed by this Board is divided into two parts:First, thatwest of the Rio Grande River, which contains10, 161. 15 acres.Second,that part east of the said river, containing 6, 738 00acres, more or less.The Pueblo grantas a whole lies in the valley of the RioGrande, approximately 25miles north of Santa Fe, partly inSanta Fe County and partly in Rio Arriba County. The factthat the Pueblois in two counties has added to the difficultiesof the Board in checking the titles to the adverse claims.41 Espanola, a town of about 500 inhabitants, lying with.in the outside boundariesof the Grant as patented andsituate near the west bank of theriver, was formerly in thecounty of Santa Fe, but in 1903 was detachedfrom Santa FeCounty and included, with a considerable area of contiguousland, in the county of Rio Arriba, Presumablythe recordspertaining to this addedarea were removed fromSanta Fe toTierra Amarilla, the county- seat of Rio Arriba County, situate about 75 miles north of Espanola, by road.The condition of the Rio Arriba County records has alwaysbeen bad, particularly so at the time of the transfer of a portion of Santa Fe County to Rio Arriba County in 1903 andfor years immediately following.That part of the grant west of the Rio Grande, containing10, 161. 15acres, is bounded on the north by the BartholomewSanchez Grant a half mile strip of land which separates theSanta Clara fromthe San Juan Pueblo Grant; on the southby the San Ildefonso Pueblo Grant, and on the west by theSanta Clara Executive Order Reservation and the foothillsof theJemez mountains.
