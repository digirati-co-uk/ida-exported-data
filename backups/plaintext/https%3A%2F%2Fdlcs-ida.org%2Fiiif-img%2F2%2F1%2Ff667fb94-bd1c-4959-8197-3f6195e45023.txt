Sir:
I have the honor to call your attention to my letter of March
II, 2898 and to lester date1 March 28, 1898, with which I forwarded
to
the Department drawings of proposed new laundry building.
The new laundry should be erected as soon as possible, as the old
one is nothing but a shell, and will not stand the running of the
20hinery
much longer.
I have strengthened
it with pillars and iron rods, but this seems
to zap it but litti, and does not stop it from continually
becoming
more unsafe.
The machinery
is also fast wearing out, owing to its unsteady
2013 ion, and I am anxious
to have it removed, as soon as possible
,
I raspectrully
ask you to rush the arrangements
for the construct
on of this new building
.
Very respectfully
,
home

Supt.de Specl.Disbg
