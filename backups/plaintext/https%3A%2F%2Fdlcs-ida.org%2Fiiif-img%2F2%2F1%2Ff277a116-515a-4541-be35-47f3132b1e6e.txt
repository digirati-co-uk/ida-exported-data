Santo I Huy Mexico, April, 26th. 1897.
Hon, Commissioner
of Indian
Arfairs
Sir
;
In reply to ortive***** adienion 14951.99
. of April 21st. 1897.
I have the honou
port
,
that the Indian boy's wound did not turn
out so seriously as the dootar exp weted, but he is rapidly tpcovering,
The Govr. took prompt sses to investigate the matter at once and I pub---
lished in a local paper the danger or shooting auch weapons anywhere
near inhabited places, 1 two been with the senti man who now rear
were the oniy parties shooting an that regasion, and who were as much
distrusson to loam of the harm they had done as the father wasalmself,
I measured the distanco mion a common winchester
sent the ball, and it
was 2800 Yds, and as familiar as I am, these stins thought it impos
sible, for the gun to have sent its charge so far.* view of all the
these statements and for the reason that the rather requested me not to
take any- further stops against the parties as he was satisfied that it
merely an unavoidabl. accident me that those Genti amon were as sorry
as he was, I have to request that the matter stop here.
Very Respoetfully
