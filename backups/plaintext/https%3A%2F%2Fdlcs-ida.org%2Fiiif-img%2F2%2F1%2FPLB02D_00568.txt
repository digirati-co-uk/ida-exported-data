This was deaf ded in 1896, long before tho Canby case,and was the law then as it is now.The Candelaria case haspointed out that the United States has a governmental interestin the Pae blo lands for the purpose of keeping them intact forIndian support. Too fewal, from the Attorney General down,could by bringing in a Pueblo as defendant in the state Courtsubmit this governmental interest to adjudioetion any more thanhe could property aotaally owned by the United States. Theretore when the Candolaria case says that the United States maybe bound by a decree in a suit" begun and prosecuted" by theSpooial Attorney for the Pueblo Indians, the words quoted mastbe given their full value. If that Attorney takes the initiative and, as plaintiff, starts and proseoutes a suit affect ingPueblo lands, the United States will be bound by the result,If someone else instituted much suit, however, and the Spe oralAttorney thinks proper to appear for or bring in the Pueblo asdefendant or intevaner, the United States and 1 ts guardianshiptitle in the Pueblo lands are not affected by the degree. Inother words, the United States and itsof pers, properlyauthori and, may bring an original suit when and where they will,but no ash officer can submit the interests of the UnitedStates to adjudication as defendant in a state Court by anyauthority short of an Act of Congress.In this way there is perfect harmony between tho Stanleyand the Candelaria decisions, and it follows that the Unitedstatos in the case at bar is in no way bound by the deeped onin the Man by case- 6
