They will then be able to till the soilproperly, and better cultivation will produce larger andbetter crops, in return for which there will be a proportionate increase in their material assets,The stallions now in use at Jemez and Santa Claraare stable bred, and therefore stable served. I believe withMr. Davis that range bred stallions can be used to better advantage than those which are stable bred. Each of the puebloshas a considerable number of pony mares running on the rangeIt would be impossible to serve these mares by the stablemethod, as they are only rounded up once or twice a year andthe majority are wild and unbroken. The stable bred stallionsare only available for use with the pony mares, which are keptup at the pueblos for farm work,In view of the importance of this work of breedingup Indians horses to secure work horses of sufficient size tohave a market value and be of real use to the Indians in theirarning, I would recomend during the coming year the purchaseof at least twelve range bred percheron stallions, to be putout on the range with the Indian pony herds. I believe thismethod offers the quickest and most affective means of breed.ing up their horses, I would put these stallions out in threeor four of the pueblos under the supervision of the farmers,where the Indians would evince sulpicient interest in thematter to provide for the olimination of the pony stallions,which now run in large numbers with their pony herds I be1ieve that a much better percentage of colts would be obtainedin the use of stallions on the range than in the use of thestable method, This is due, not only to the nature of Indianponies in their native state, but to the fact it is difficultto impress upon the Indians the necessity of bringing theirmares in at the proper periods. It would seem, therefore,from every standpoint that the range method of breeding ispreferable,In my opinion, at this time more stress may beproperly laid upon the breeding up of the Indian horses thanupon the increase of the Indian cattle.
