IRRIGATION.
While the reservation presents no opportunity for the
usual irrigation projects, to enable the farming of tracts of
land by this method, yet it does present sufficient under
surface water supply to permit stock- water through shallow
wells. A large number of these have been developed in the
Hopi and Navajo country, permitting a considerable increase
in the number of head of stock to these Ind lans. Too much
credit cannot be given to the service directed by Super intendent
H. F. Robinson, of the Indian Irrigation Department. The work
on the reservation is ably looked after by his Foreman, Mr.
A. A. Womack. A larger appropriation for this work--- an
appropriation made for work entirely within the Moqui borders,
would greatly facilita te matters, since it is here that
so many of the stock and population questions center.
The restriction of the Hopi Indians to their mesas, a matter
for which the Hopi is partly to blame, owing to his clanni sh
religious system, and for which the grasping Navajo is largely
to blame, has resulted in the overgrazing of large areas.
No amount of well- water can restore these areas to present
feeding grounds for increasing herds of stock. The Hopi should
be insured wider grazing areas, and the Nava jo either removed
from these areas or so rigidly disciplined that the Hopi need
no longer fear him.
