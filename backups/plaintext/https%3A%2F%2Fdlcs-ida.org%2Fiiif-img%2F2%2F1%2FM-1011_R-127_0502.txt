The potatoes and a portion of theoats weredistributed among the pueblos for planting, after instruction in the method of planting, irrigating and cultivatinghad been given the Indians in detail. The season was consideredtoo far advanced to use the oats for planting in the valleys, andonly a portion of them were issued to be used in the mountainson the executive order reservation at Santa Clara. The distribution of this seed for planting by the Indians is largely in inthenature of an experiment to ascertain to what extent the Indianswill carry out the directions given them in the proper irrigationand cultivation of the potatoes and oats, without the supervisionof a farmer,It is believed that this section has the climate and soilnecessary to raise potatoes, and that oats can be suc cessfullyraised here. Both the se crops would be very desirable adjunctsto those now raised by the Indians, in providing a staple of dietfor the Indians and feed for their stock. Where attempts havebeen made to raise potatoes, flood irrigation has given the plantstoo much water, and on drying out has baked the soil, under whichconditions it is not surprising that the attempts made have resulted in failures.
