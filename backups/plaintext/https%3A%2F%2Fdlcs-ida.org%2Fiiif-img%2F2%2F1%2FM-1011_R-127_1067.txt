STThe Commissioner of Indian Affairs-- 2boy, deserves special mention. He had become almost blind, wasnot able to attendschoolfor the reason the he could not see, and could do very little in his industrial work. He was detailed to the engineering department and truck driving. Therewas nothing he enjoyed more than driving a truck, but failing eyesight made it unsafe for him to be out on the road. He wanted to go home. I persuaded him to goto Dr. Eiler' s hospital in Albuquerque, where he underwent a series of operations fortrachome. He returned to the school in about two weeks and by wearing glasses wasenabled to resume his school work. His father was almost overjoyed over the fact:that his boy was brought" from darkness into light" and his expressions of gratitudein his Indian fashion made it worth while to say nothing of what it meant to the boy.The hospital building should be replaced with a new building,There aro a number of things in the way of equipment that are badly needed, among whichis a modern operating room and equipment. This will be provided, no doubt, when anew hospital, which is under consideration, is built. This school is fortunate inhaving an efficient nurse. There are no influences which operate to prevent thehospital from performing its maximum usefulnessNo additional employees are needed for carrying on thehealth work at the school. I approve of the suggestion that when a newr hospitalis built that it will be large enough to accommodate a number of the NorthernPueblos Indians as well as a hospital for the school children. If this is done,we shall doubtless be able to meet the most urgent need for carrying on the medicalor health work of the school
