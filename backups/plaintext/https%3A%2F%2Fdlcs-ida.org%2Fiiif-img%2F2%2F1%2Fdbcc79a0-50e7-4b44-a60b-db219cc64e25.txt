Leupp Training School.( 23)FFICEOFвванцувра AUG311910OFINDIANASLAND DIVISION--- POPULATION SECTION.For six years past we have had Business Councils of the Na ya JoIndians on this Reservation-- an average of eight to ten a year.Committees have been appointed or elected by the Indians, and arecomposed of the Indian Judges and three other Indians, electedcalled Head Men.The se Committees make it their business toC' eport violations of the regulations on the Reservation and thegeneral progress of the Indians. I consider the services sorendered as very valuable in the administration of the affairsof the Reservation. It is much easier to control the body ofIndians we have by mana ging four or five good men, than it is toattempt to reach the members of the tribe individually. Thesefour or five men control the remainder of the tribe if they areproperly dealt with. I think these committees are composed ofthe most influential and possible the most intelligent of theOribe on the Reservation.The Indians of this jurisdiction have received no funds, suchas annuities or trust funds.
