11Circular No. 1604.July 1, 1926H OPI INDIANAGENCYcamANNUAL REPORTNARRATIVE SECTIONSection 1-Law and OrderThe present agency buildings are insufficient. We needpolice quarters for at present we have no place at all for themto stop or make their headquarters when on duty at the agency.This is a very important need. We would have no use for anyspace in any federal building.We have much need at different times of the year for afew irregular laborers not allowed on present allotted funds.We also need, owing to the recent addition of the Red Lakecountry, another stockman position.
