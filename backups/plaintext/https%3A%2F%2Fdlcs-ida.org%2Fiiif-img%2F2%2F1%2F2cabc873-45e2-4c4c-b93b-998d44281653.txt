three at Moen Avi, six miles distant, so that it would not have takenMr. Ma hugh very long to have taken the testimonyfrom each head of a famlyin the settlement, which would certainlyhave saved us a great deal ofdistressand expense.I am not relatedto Mr. Nebekerat all, and have no interest,directlyor indirt ctly, in the prosecutionof his claim.I know Ah- Co- Er- She, one of the Indiansto whom a part of Nebcker's land has been allotted.He is a good, straightforwardIndia,and his word is taken readilyfor everythinghe undertakesin our neighborhood.He says he never had any claim to the land that has brenallottedto him, and does not want it, and will not take it; that he hasland of his own, that he has lived on for years and improved, that hasbeen taken from him by this allottingae nt and given to an other Ind lan.I am also know all the other Indiansto whom allotmentsof Ne beker's landhave been made. None of them have the slightestclaim to it.Theydo not pretend that they have, except by virtue of the allotment, andof course,as they are urged by the agents to assert their claim andtake the land give n to them by" Washington," they try to do so.TheIndians are not to be blamed nearly so much as the agents who have unjustly allottedthem our lands and then incitedthem to take and hold itforcibly. Beforethe se agents came here, we seettledevery questionthat arose amicably; were always friendly, and all prosperedbetter thanunder present conditions.nerSubscribedand sworn to before me this secondday of June, 1898Seth& TannerNG.Saytonthe RoboteCourtfir CoconinoArizonacurkofZlatory
