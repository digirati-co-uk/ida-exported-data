It is usually oftender beef and good to eat. Drying meat is one method of preparing it for later use.Slice the beef carefully into thin pieces, making them abouteight inches long and about five inches wide. Some could be longer,but the smaller they are the quicker they will dry. Salt each pieceon both sides so that no fly will attempt to feast on it. When all themeat has been sliced take the pieces and hang them up on a line, seeingthat the line is clean. Turn the meat over from one side to the otherso that both sides will dry by the sun.Whenever there is danger of a storm take meat down from theline so that it can be kept clean. When the storm is over take thepieces out and hang them up again in the sun.If one thinks the meat is thoroughly dry, take it down and putit away in a cool place.The Indians preserve their meat by this method. When theyneed it to flavor other foods they take this dried meat and pound itup into small pieces and cook it with whatever they want to, usuallyin chili stew, beans, and corn.llllllllllll-lli—||||||lllllll-llllllllllllllllllllll-----Drying FruitSANTANA MONTOYA( Pueblo, San Juan)llllllllllllll-----llllllllllll----lllll-In summer when there is plenty of fruit and sunshine the Indians usually dry fruit to store away for winter use. The fruits thatare dried are peaches, apricots, apples and plums.First of all they pick the fruit carefully so as not to bruise it.They place it in buckets and baskets and take it home.Apples are first peeled and sliced and the seeds removed, thenthey are taken outside in the sunshine to dry. They are spread onboards or papers in the sun.Peaches and apricots do not have to be peeled. They are onlycut into halves and the seeds taken out. They are then put in the sunto dry just as the apples were.Plums are first washed, then put out to dry. The seeds do nothave to be removed.When the fruit is dry it is washed again before it is put away.The Indians put the fruit away in cans or boxes.Another way of drying some fall apples: They first bake themin an oven, and when they are taken from the oven they are peeledand put away to dry whole.---llllllllllllllllllllllll----!!|---||11--llllllll|-|-|-llll-|llllll-||||||||||||||11| 11-|-|-|-|-il- 111-44-M-lii----|-———-|||-||-||-|-||-|Page Forty- one
