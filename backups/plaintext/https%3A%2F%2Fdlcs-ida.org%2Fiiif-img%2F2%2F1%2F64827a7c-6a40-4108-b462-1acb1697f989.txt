C.AUG241920AFFAIRSSir:In compliance with instructions contained in theabove form letter of July 29, 1920, returned herewith,I have the honor to advise that corrections in our retaincopy of the report as indicated, with the exception ofpage 30.We have made no changes in page 30 for the reasonthat the report as it now stands represents our best estimate of the stock on the reservation belonging to individual Indians. This estimate has been arrived at from pers onal observations and conversations with agency farmers whoare quite familiar with the stock owned by Indians. It istrue that the 1920 report is far different from the reportfor 1919 but we are of the opinion that the report for 1920comes much nearer representing true conditions. Both reportsare based largely on estimates as it is impossible with ourlimited for ce and the extent of the reservation to give actualcounts and appraisements. Considerable attention however wasgiven this feature of the 1920 report and we believe it a moreaccurate report than that of 1919.We also have been ableto give more attention to the stock industry of the reservation during the last year with our sheep dipping, dourine tests,etc., and feel that we are now in better position to make anestimate of number and values than at any time in the past,Very respectfully,OvauWestekTPMInol.Supt.& S.
