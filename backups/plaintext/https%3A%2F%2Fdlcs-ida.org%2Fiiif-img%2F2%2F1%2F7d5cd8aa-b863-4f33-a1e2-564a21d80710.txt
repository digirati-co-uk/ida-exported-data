Schools.
Two Indian children attended the District School last year
here at Crown Point.
classroom instruction in the boardingschool
has been only partially satisfactory: the instruction given in the
industrial de partment, particularly that of carpenter and engineer
can be improved upon.
The fine band that was maintained heretofore
was disbanded last October and most of its members transferred to
the Albuquer que School.
The Second Annual Hair surpassed that of 1916; although
the unusual droughth was detrimental to the Indians' crops; the
quantity was not equal to that of the year previous.
The art
of home canning was made special and demonstrations were given
during the fair for the benefit of the Indian and white women
present.
More than 2,500 Indians and whites were in attendence.
Nearly two thousand dollars worth of products were grown at the
school farm, despite the dry year.
Twenty- three head of hogs
were fattened and killed, and the meat cured for the childrens'
tables.
Vegetables were grown in such quantities that it gave
us a varied bill- of- fare, which is always welcome where such things
are hard to get.
Employees with several excentions have worked in harmony with
each other and for the interest and advancement of the individual
pupil.
