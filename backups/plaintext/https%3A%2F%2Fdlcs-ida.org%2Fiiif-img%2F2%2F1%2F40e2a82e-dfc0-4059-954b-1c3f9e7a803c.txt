Santa Fe, New Mexico, July 19, 1898,
Hon. Comissioner of Indian Affairs,
Washington, D.C.
Sir:
I have the honor to request authority to exp end a sum not exceed
ing$ 48.00 in the open market purchase of 6 large pigs at$ 8.00 each.
It will cost nothing to feed them until they should be killed
in the fall, as we have plenty of slop from the mess and school kitchen
to feed them and the change in food for the pupils will be very benefio
sal, and also a considerable saying in beer.
Very respectfully,
hom, sous
Supt. Specl.Disbg.Agent.
