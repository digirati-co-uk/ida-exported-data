Peace!Xavier LovatoAutumnMartinezI am happy to have spent 6 years here at the Santa Fe IndianSchool. Memories that I will cherish. In middle school I foundan amazing brother who is Stephen Vallo. I made new friendshere that I would not be able to find at any other school. Myhigh- school years were challenging, but I welcomed them.High- school has given me opportunities to meet more newfriends who turned into best friends, such as Rickie Vigil,Brandon Lujan, Donica Aguilar, Charles Alonzo, and TyrellWestica. A person who I will not forget that has helped methrough my senior year, Wayne Abeita, always pushed me tosucceed. We made it class of 2015.Autumn Martinez93
