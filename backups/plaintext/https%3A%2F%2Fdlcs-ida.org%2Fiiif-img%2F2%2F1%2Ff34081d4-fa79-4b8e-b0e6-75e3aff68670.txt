Dear Sir:
I am just home from Taos, and find your letter asking that your
inoney be sent you. I cannot do so, and had I beon at home, I doubt if I
should have permitted you to go home, mless the necessity was very
urgent. I trust you will return SOON, and thou ou may draw at least
a portion of your money.
I am very truly,
Mlientais
Superintendont.
