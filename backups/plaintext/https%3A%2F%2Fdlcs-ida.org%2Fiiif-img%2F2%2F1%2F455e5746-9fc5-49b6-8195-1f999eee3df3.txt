..Schools
There is the very best of relation existing between our
Indian schools and nearby public school officials and the super
intendent of the public schools of the county, who visits our
reservation at least once every year. We have two public
schools on the reservation.
We have plenty of school facilities within reach of all of
our ohildren of school age, on and off the reservation, who
wish to attend public schools.
The greatest need of the boarding school plant here is ad.
ditional water supply. This matter has been taken up in a
special report to the Office.
We have no school farm, which is a serious handicap. Every
year we increase the school garden acreage and add a number of
fruit trees. In time we will have splendid orchards here.
The force of employees in our boarding and day schools is
efficient and quite satisfactory. At several places we need
teachers, and several assistants are needed to carry on the
work properly.
We have had no graduation at the boarding school here.
This sohool was started only four years ago. We do not graduate
at any of the day schools but transfer the pupils when they com
plete the grades carried at each school. The character of the
girls returning from outside schools is not what it should be.
They do not seem to be strong enough to resist the many tempta
tions and degrading influences of roservation life. Too many of
the boys return home unfit to take up any special line of work
or to make a living on the outside by following any special
trade. In many ways we assist these people& great deal, and
many are placed outside at good wages.
We have no mission or contract schools on the reservation.
