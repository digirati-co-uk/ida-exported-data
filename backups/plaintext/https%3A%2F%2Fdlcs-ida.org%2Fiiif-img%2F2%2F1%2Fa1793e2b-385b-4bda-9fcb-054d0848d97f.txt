O0some localities from the overrlow and altogether only anominal corn crop was harvested.All three cuttings oralfalra yielded an abundant crop and grass was abundanteverywhere. Stock of all kinds entered and passed throughthe winter in splendid condition and in spite of lack ofprecipitation for the past eight months grass started in thespring and there has, up to the close of the year, been nosurfering of stock for either feed or water although in mostplaces the supply is becoming short.The cool weather of the spring months favored thegrowth or alfalfa and the first cutting gave a good yield.The first cutting began about the 10 of June.Owing to lackor precipitation in the mountains and elsewhere water forirrigation was very low and prospects for a short crop in alllines 1s indicated.The spring was unusually backward and warm weatherdid not appear until the middle of May.The cold backward springdid some damage to the fruit crop in many places but there willbe at least a short crop of apples, peaches, cherries, grapes etc.Vegetables are not largely raised by these Indians duelargely to the lack or water for irrigation.They do fairly wellwhere water can be had and would add much to the Indians dietcould they be produced abundantly. The squash, melons, onions, peas andbeans are the principlevarietiesraised.The LagunaIndianshave, in all, about 40000 sheep together
