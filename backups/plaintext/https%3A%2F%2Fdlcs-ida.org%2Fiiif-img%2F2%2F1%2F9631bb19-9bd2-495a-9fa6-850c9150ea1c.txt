very fach inherested
as a class in making a fa. After our trip
to the farm there was a good deal of free hand drawing of the
farm. This helped considerably
to interest the children in
making a farm of our own. After making pictures
and discussing
them as best we were able with our very limited English we
started
on our farm in earnest. A great many discussions
were
held before the children
could decide upon the location
of the
farm in the classroom
, the size of the various buildings
they
wanted to make, the work various children
were to do etc.
The
boys did all of the building
while the girls made paper furniture
for the small hogan and rag dolls to represent
the family who
lived there.
I soon found that the extensive
building
program
as we had
first planned was a little too much to expect from the class
so we modified
the program to some extent. Lincoln
Logs were
used in building
the fence, the goat barn, and a couple of other
buildings
.
The making of the different
farm animals
from clay
afforded
a great deal of enjoyment
to all of the children
as well 18 teaching
them to count. This part the children
enjoyed
most of all.
Each morning we talked about the different
foods used in
the lunch period and talked about what was being done as the
thing was done, such as, I wash the raisins, I put them in the
kettle, I put water on them, etc. I tried never to introduce
a
word which held no meaning for the children
but give them new
words only when they could see what it weg or what it meant.
As much as possible
concrete
articles
There were a good many
different
toys in the classroom
which helped in this.
During this language
period in the mornings
the children
learned
more than just a varied vocabulary
about foods for each
child had his turn in helping
to do the various
things. of them helped
strain
the milk, some washed
fruit, some washed
and dried the dishes
after the lunch period. All of this gave
thom many opportunities
to talk and tell the others what they
were doing.
Serving
the lunch also afforded
a great chance for learning
many things. The various
tasks connected
with serving
the lunch
were passed around
the class so that each child had a turn at
each part of the serving
. Each child told what he was doing,
imitating
after the teacher
at first until he or she could say
it along
.
For instance
when passing
the bread the child would
day," I pass the bread."
Table manner s were taught
also at the lunch per iod. of course
the things
were often
forgotten
and some hungry
little
