I probablywas over thinking it, but that is nothing new. High school hasbeen a great experience with blur spots in between. I cannotwait to look back at these years and think, “ Wow I looked likethat?" Although, I strongly disliked my group of friends atfirst, a blessing to have them in my life with the memories wecreated. I have loved every moment of high school, and nowthat it is ending, I will cherish those people who have pushedand supported me. We did it!Keri Muniz114
