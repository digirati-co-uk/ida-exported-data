Jicarilla Indian School.
IV. Industries:
Farming operations on the reservation, among the
Indians, has been carried on more extensively during the past
year, than any previous year. The authority was granted, for me
to issue 40,000# of oats for seeding purpose last spring and a
great many of the Indians, made use of the opportunity, who had
never put forth an effort before to do very much farming.
The success of the past season's operations was
very good, altho, it was an exceptionally dry year, and ditches
were not completed, sufficiently, to irrigate the land that was
seeded.
The Indians are not supplied with suitable farm equip
ment, as their farming is mostly done with implements loaned to
them by the agency. They have not provided any means for the care
of fara implemente
.
Farming, at the school and agency during the last
year, was not very successful, altho the oats yielded a fair crop,
while the potato crop was an entire failure. Conditions have been
greatly remediod by the construction
of a flumer√•nd thee extension
of the Dulce lake irrigating diteh, which places about 50 acres
of the school farm under irrigation
. The outlook, for an excellent
crop of oats, hay and potatoes, for this year, is very favorable.
The Indians are making an efforttat self support,
as quite a number of them have been away from the reservation,
