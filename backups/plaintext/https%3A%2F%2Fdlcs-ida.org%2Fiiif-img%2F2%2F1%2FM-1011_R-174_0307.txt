SECTION III-- SCHOOLS.1.Relationship existing between public schoolsand Indian schools in general is very good. Howeverthere are very few Indian children enrolled in publicschools in this vicinity.2.We have facilities for taki ng care of onlyabout one- half of the scholastic population of the reservation. The schools, both boarding and day, should be enlarged. The Mission school at the Zuni pueblo takes care ofab out 35 pupils but it should not be expected that theydo more than they are now doing.3.( 4)Both schools, day and boarding, shouldbe doubled in capacity. Also buildings for thehousing of employees are needed at both places.( b)We have an excellent school farm and gardenand in connection with the boarding school an agencyfarm is operated. These farras are well equippedand opportunity is afford ed all pupils to get agood training in irregated farming the way that issecuring best results in this section,( c)The employee situation is deplorable.We have less than. 25% of regular employees. Somepositions are filled by very incompetent temporaries. Othere it is found impossible to fi11 at all,People wont, and dont work for salaries now paid.- 12
