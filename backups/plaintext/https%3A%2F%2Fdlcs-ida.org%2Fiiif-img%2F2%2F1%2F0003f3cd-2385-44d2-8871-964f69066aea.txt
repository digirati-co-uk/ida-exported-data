All was well as I walked into the cafeteria to eatlunch. We were having hamburgers that day, but that isn' t important. What isimportant is what happened after the majority of students sat down.As I sat down, the students around me had' a restless look in their eyes. Somethingbig was about to happen.Students began pounding on the table and then it became quiet again. Then all atonce the pounding began. Someone threw a hamburger, then milk; before I knewwhat happened, the food started flying. I stood up and saw people running to the doorso I ran to the door. People were running and throwing food at the same time.I barely made it. Some students weren' t so lucky and they had to take theresponsibility for what a few STUPID students had done. Gladly, no one was hurt inthe chaos.— Anonymous49
