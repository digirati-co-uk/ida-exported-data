YEARBOOKeing inYearbookClass is prettymuch a differentexperience from a regular class. Unlike regularclasses with merry- go- roundroutines, Yearbook Class has arollercoaster of events. What I meanby" rollercoaster of events," is the classhas many ups and downs.At times we have the grandest time with ourwork and each other. Laughing and being completely involved with our work.Our gloomy days are when we' re near a deadline and sobehind. When no one feels like working on Production Night( anagreed night we decide to work), or some materials are lost, forjust plain and simply ruined and can' t be used. Other littlesetbacks involved are people not showing up when they' re needed andmistakes that have to be corrected at least 15 times... Or just trash the wholepage and start over!In the midst of our confusion, the dark, the gloom, the fear of not meeting thedeadline. Our cries are heard by a powerful force which is a sign for hope, alast chance, and enhances a spark of compassion. In the midst of thegloom and the dark, emerges a faint figure and as it approachescloser, it is identified as... Martza! Our master of disaster fromZuni land to clear the gloom, the darkness and to shed a littlelight on our day. Bless your heart Martza.Through thick and thin, I think we managed towalk on water. To the 1992 Yearbook Class it wasdefinitely a year of seeing the world in different SHADES.- Barry W. â€”158
