various communities as a whole. Where the meetings were confined to
useful pur suits and to discussions they were pleasant and successful
but when dances were given for the pleasure and entertainment of the
returned student group, the surrounding population proved themselves
obnoxious and such entertainments had to be discouraged.
The highest class maintained in any day school of this juris
diction was a fourth grade. However, at every school the industrial
program was carried out. It ranged from the simple chores necessary
and
to keep the fires going, the plant clean, to toy making for boys and
sewing and cooking for the girls. Since most of the teachers are
women the girls receive more valuable instruction along industrial
lines than the boys.
Our school plants are satisfactory for their purposes. A few
more tools and a small amount of lumber would enable us to do a
little more work along industrial lines. The new plants at Seama and
Encinal will complete the schools needed for the present in this
jurisdiction. Our next concern will be to provide more capacity for
the advanced grades we expect to maintain at the various day schools.
The efficiency, loyalty and cooperation among the employees during
the past year has been above the average. Employees are well provided
for as a general thing. At Acomite, however, we have a school plant,
recently completed, with no provisions for additional teachers. It will
be necessary to rent quarters until new construction is complete.
The actual expenditure for all purposes in connection with the
