( B)In January some of the group decided to build a hogan whichstarted the unit on" Navajo Home Life". The girls were much moresuccessful in huilding a stone hogan than were the boys. Theyounger children collected native materials while the older girlsand some of the boys did the building. Some of the younger boysbecame enthusiastic that they worked after school hours in orderto finish their hogans for play. They soon found that theirhogans would not stand and decided to ask Miss Martin's classhowthey built theirs. Dirt instead of sand and slightly largerstonessolved this problem, and the children set to work with still moreenthusiasm.While working and playing with their hogans, the childrentalked about the types of hogans, ways to build and what the Navajofamily does at home.The pictures drawn at this time improvedrapidly insofar as story content was concerned.Several enlargedand tinted pietures of Navajo life were displayed to help thechildren.Discussions at this time were more interesting and the childrenwere somewhat less self- conscious.After one week end, some ofthe younger boys reported upon their activities outdoors.Belowis their story:Some boys made a stone hogan.They made a sidewalk.They made steps.There was a little tree.They made a swing.
