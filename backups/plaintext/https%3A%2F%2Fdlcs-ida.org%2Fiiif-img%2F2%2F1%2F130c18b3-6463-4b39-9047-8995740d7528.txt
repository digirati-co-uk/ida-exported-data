In January some of the group decided to build a hogan which
started the unit on" Navajo Home Life". The girls were much more
successful in huilding a stone hogan than were the boys. The
younger children collected native materials while the older girls
and some of the boys did the building. Some of the younger boys
became enthusiastic that they worked after school hours in order
to finish their hogans for play. They soon found that their
hogans would not stand and decided to ask Miss Martin's classhow
they built theirs. Dirt instead of sand and slightly largerstones
solved this problem, and the children set to work with still more
enthusiasm.
While working and playing with their hogans, the children
talked about the types of hogans, ways to build and what the Navajo
family does at home.
The pictures drawn at this time improved
rapidly insofar as story content was concerned.
Several enlarged
and tinted pietures of Navajo life were displayed to help the
children.
Discussions at this time were more interesting and the children
were somewhat less self- conscious.
After one week end, some of
the younger boys reported upon their activities outdoors.
Below
is their story:
Some boys made a stone hogan.
They made a sidewalk.
They made steps.
There was a little tree.
They made a swing.
