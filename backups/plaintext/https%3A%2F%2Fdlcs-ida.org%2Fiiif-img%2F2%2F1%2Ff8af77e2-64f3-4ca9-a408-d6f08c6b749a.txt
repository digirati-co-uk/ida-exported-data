by physicians, field matrons, farmers and other government employees,
who make suggestions for improvement and make efforts to carry them into
offeot.
Toilets are very seldom erooted except in very isolated cases, and
where found are usually of a good type. While the ereotion of these by
certain selected individuals is encouraged in general the enforcement of
the erection of privies in the pueblos is at present unpractical for un
less a pueblo could be put under military rule and enforce the use and
care of them they would only become a source of filth and a breeding
place for flies.
Indians are not advanced enough in our civilization to
use them. Where the Indian deposits his excrement on the ground, as is
now done, the dogs, hogs and chickens which are the scavengers of the
pueblo, soon olean it up and the intense sunshine and dry air of New
Mexico does the disinfection. Stock farms and corrals are usually
placed in close proximity to dwelling places. These are a breeding
place for flies which is a menace.
The moving of these from the pueblo
and the proper care of them should be enforced. Government officials
and employees should be given proper support in enforcing sanitary
measures.
Moral suasion and a sympathetic attitude while essential in
dealing with the Indian are not always effective anymore than they are
in carrying out health work in any community.
The Indians dry fruits, vegetables and meats and thus preserve then
for future use.
In most instances these are exposed uncovered and are
swarming with flies.
Screened in drying racks built by the government
and placed at intervals in the pueblo should be provided.
