the enrollment of 1904 of one hundred twenty pupils, seventy
have since died and a review of the attendance from year to
year indicates a very high mortality rate.
During the past.
winter sixty- five children were enrolled and all who came
did so voluntarily.
of nine pupils sent to a non- reservation
school less than three years ago but one is left there to
complete the term of enrollment.
During the past winter an Indian of more than three
score and ten years of age in conversation stated that he
had had eighteen children and ten grandchildren all of whom
were placed in school at Albuquerque, Tort Lewis, Santa Te,

to be with him in his ripe age.
He offered the story not as
a complaint but that we might be advised of his loss.
