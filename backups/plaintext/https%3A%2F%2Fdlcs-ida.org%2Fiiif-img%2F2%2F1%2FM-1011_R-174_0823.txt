DEMONSTRATION IN TREATING SEED WHEAT WITH CORONA COPPER CARB,
FOR THE PREVENTION OF SMUT. Conducted May 2, 1927 under the
direction of Farmer F. Ellis Nielson,
Two bushels of very smutty, spring wheat was selected from
the store room of a Zuni Indlan for this test.
One bushel of this wheat was placed in a barrel with 4 oz.
of Corona Copper Carb. Then a tight cover was placed over the
mouth of the barrel, and the barrel was rolled over the ground
until the powder was thoroughly mixed through the wheat. This
wheat was planted in the field of the plot where the bushel of
smutty wheat that was untreated was planted. This was done, so
as to determine whether or not the treating process did any good.
The following results were obtained:-
The treated wheat, grew better, yielded more, and although
not entirely free from smut was not greatly damaged by the smut.
This demonstration proved that this method of treating wheat for
But was successful and that the treating of this same wheat the
second season would completly rid it of smut, provided other pre
cautions were taken.
The demonstration was carried on with boys from the l' arm
detail of the Black Rock School and the Indian from whom the
wheat was purchased.
Attached pioture shows the demonstration in treating the
wheat.
