ATHLETICS
at the Santa Fe Indian School
Once again, the Braves and the Lady
Braves proved themselves competitive
throughout New Mexico and beyond. From
football to volleyball, from cross country to
track, from basketball to baseball, the Santa
Fe Indian School played hard, and showed
why the ceiling of Abeyta Gym is dotted with
banner after banner.
Susie gives two thumbs up for free games.
