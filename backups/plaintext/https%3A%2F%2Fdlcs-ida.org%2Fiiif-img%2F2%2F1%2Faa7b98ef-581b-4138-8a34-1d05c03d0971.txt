Sheet VII-------- Section III--- Schools------ contidloyal and the nembers have cooperated for the benefit ofthe school.The school has one gardener, who has been in charge ofthe farming and gardening operations, with a great many othermiscellaneous duties to perform. A laborer has had charge ofthe dairy and the hogs with a great many other duties connected with the care of grounds, etc., to require his attention.In order to make the instruction and training in gardening,farming and dairying, what they should be, it will be necessayto employe a teacher of agriculture and a farmer. The requirements of the new course of study and the enlarging of theschool farm, together with the increased attendance at theschool, make these positions necessary. For the proper development of the pupils and to provide for their physicaltraining, a physical director whould be employed, and in order that the girls may receive proper training in their department,, a teacher of domestic art: should be added to thecorps of employees. I estimate that salaries of these positions should be as follows:FarmerTeacher of AgriculturePhysical DirectorTeacher of Domestic Art$ 1000 per yr.10001000660 ltThe salary list is low at this school and after makingthe additions above noted, it will amount to$ 31, 690. 00, including salary of the superintendent, or will be at the rateof$ 70. 40 per pupil. By comparison I am sure the office willfind this very low for a non- reservation school giving a fullQUIKE vocational course.
