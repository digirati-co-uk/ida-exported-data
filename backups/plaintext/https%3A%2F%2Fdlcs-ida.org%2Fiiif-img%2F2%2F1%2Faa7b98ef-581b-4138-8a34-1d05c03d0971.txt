loyal and the nembers have cooperated for the benefit of
the school.
The school has one gardener, who has been in charge of
the farming and gardening operations, with a great many other
miscellaneous duties to perform. A laborer has had charge of
the dairy and the hogs with a great many other duties connect
ed with the care of grounds, etc., to require his attention.
In order to make the instruction and training in gardening,
farming and dairying, what they should be, it will be necessay
to employe a teacher of agriculture and a farmer. The re
quirements of the new course of study and the enlarging of the
school farm, together with the increased attendance at the
school, make these positions necessary. For the proper dev
elopment of the pupils and to provide for their physical
training, a physical director whould be employed, and in or
der that the girls may receive proper training in their de
partment,, a teacher of domestic art: should be added to the
corps of employees. I estimate that salaries of these posi
tions should be as follows:
Farmer
Teacher of Agriculture
Physical Director
Teacher of Domestic Art
$ 1000 per yr.

The salary list is low at this school and after making
the additions above noted, it will amount to$ 31, 690. 00, in
cluding salary of the superintendent, or will be at the rate
of$ 70. 40 per pupil. By comparison I am sure the office will
find this very low for a non- reservation school giving a full
QUIKE vocational course.
