of the past fiscal year with those of preceding
years, on
account of the fact that this is a jurisdiction
made up
of only a part of the former jurisdiction
and my office
records' concerning
expenditures
of the past are entirely
lacking
,
Fairly good use has been made of what playground
facilities
we had, but there was no systematio supervision
of playground
activities
at any of the schools until very
late in the year. Mr Coon finally succeeded in getting these
instituted
but the instructors
were hardly capable of carry
ing out his instructions
to any marked degree. Both boys and
girls have had swings, teeter boards, basket balls and in
door baseballs, and the boys hatte had outdoor base balls and
bats, all of which have been used more or less unsystemati
cally.
From present conditions and indications, it appears that
it will be necessary to maintain Indian schools in this
jurisdiction for at least from ten to fifteen years, for the
reason, principally, that public school facilities will not
be available. The present public school facilities are woe
fully lacking for the present population who are not eligible
to attend any Indian Schools, and it is hardly to be expected
that sufficient additional equipment will be provided within
the next decade to make it advisable for us to discontinue
our system. As a matter of information, it may be stated
that until the last year the major portion of the instruction
given in the public schools was in mongrel Spanish. It was
only at the last session of the State Legislature that the
American representation thebein was sufficientay strong to
force through a bill making the teaching of English, for at
least one- half of the school period, obligatory. This is
now being carried out after a fashion, though, in some cases,
by teachers who are ino√°pable of carrying on an intelligent
conversation
in English.
