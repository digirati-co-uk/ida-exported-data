Little Water School.

Mire called for
clothing. The text books used are those furnished by the Govern
ment.
All the supplies and materials are in good condition,
and are receiving proper care and attention.
A one story adobe building of the same size as the present
school building is now in process of construction, when it is com
pleted it will increase the capacity of the school, but there will
not be sufficient accommodations for employees, at the present time
the employees are badly crowded. At the time of my inspection, the
contractor had just commenced to put in the foundation for the new
building.
An employees building should be built, it should
contain a mess kitchen, mess dining room, employees sitting room,
sewing room, a room for visitors, and two rooms for employees.
A laundry should be provided.
There are but two sewing
machines at this school, one is in good condition, it has been in
use some time, the other is not in running order, two new Singer
sewing machines should be furnished.

The agent and other employees aid and assist school in every
manner possible, but it is Mrs Devore who gathers the children, and
makes this school a success. The missionary located near this
place takes full charge of each evening session of school, he tea
ches his religion, nothing else.
My only recommendation, that regarding the appointment of Mrs.
Devore as superintendant will be found on page 3.
Very respectfully.
