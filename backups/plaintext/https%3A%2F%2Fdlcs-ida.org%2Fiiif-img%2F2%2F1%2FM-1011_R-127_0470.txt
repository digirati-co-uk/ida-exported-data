Annual Report- 6Santa Fe School,resented by white and Mexican population alikeThe trusteeship of Pueblo lands by the government wouldpromote the development of the se uncultivated tracts a nd provea benefit alike to the Indian and the State, in increasing thematerial prosperity of the Indian and adding to the economicvalue of the communityAnother contributing cause to race prejudice is that thecommunity life of the Indians tends to combine them in commoncause against the encroachments of land- hungry Mexican and whitesettlers. In my opinion this prejudice will always exist to agreater or less extent, It steps were taken to remove a con.tributing cause by taxing the Indians, the result would be thatin less than a decade the lands would be sold for taxes and lostto the Indians. The reason for this is that at present theIndian does not understand the obligations of citizenship, andcannot appreciate the necessity of pay ing his share of the support of the government under which he lives by meeting the taxeslevied upon him. The trustee ship plan would permit, throughthe supervision and tutelage of the Office, proper farming ofthe land now under cultivation by means of application of modern agricultural methods, and in the increase of the materialwelfare and prosperity of the Pueblos through the building upof their stock and herds, and in the development and cultinationof the unused resources of the various pueblo grantsEducationally, through the compulsory attendance-nowquestionable- of all the Indian children of school age at theday schools, the jurisdiction and control of the governmentpossible through the trusteeship plan will insure the educationof the Indian, essential in his equipment for assuming the bur.den and responsibility of real citizenshipThe benefits to accrue to the state through governmenttrusteeship of the Pueblo lands, in insuring eventually a desirable citizen in the Indian, far outweigh the more immediatereturn to be derived from taxation of the grant lands, possiblethrough thrusting the Indian into citizenship before he isprepared for it. A further benefit to the state lies in theincrease in economic wealth through the development of theIndian lands, to be carried on by the Office
