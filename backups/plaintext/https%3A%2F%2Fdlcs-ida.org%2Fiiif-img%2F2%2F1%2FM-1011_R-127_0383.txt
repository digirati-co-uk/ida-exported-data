In my judgement it would be practical
to establish temporary tent hospitals for
the treatment of reservation
patients. Miss
Eleanor D. Gregg, Supervisor of Field Nurses
and Field Metrons
, visited Toadlena during
the late winter making a study of the possibil
ities along that line. With Principal Hashbarger
and myself she visited many hogans, acquainting
herself with conditions

seen but one such case. During the year a total
of 1210 patients have sought and obtained treat

so treated, but according to my records these
have been cassed under 76 heads, and as has
been steated only one case of venereal disease
has been seen.
With the completion
of the school hospi
tal, a nurse and an assistant, possibly two
assistants, will be necessary to carry on the
work of the school. For reservation work there
should be an additional
physician, who should
visit at regular intervals different
portions
of the jurisdiction, holding
clinics. There should
also be field nurses and field matrons, especially
the former. Miss Gregg went fully into these mat
ters at the time of her visit. Nothing has ever
been done to reach the women on this jurisdiction
and at first it will be very difficult- owing
to their religious beliefs which call for

by continued effort these things could be over

We have made and are making a conscientious
and paiastaking
effort to carry out the Health
Program at the Toadlena. School, both in spirit
and in letter, so far as our facilities will per
mit, we have no hospital or hospital
equipment,
or nurse, or field matrons, or outside stations
such as the Program calls for. So far as this
Program has to do with school work it has been
adopted and is being carried out in its every
