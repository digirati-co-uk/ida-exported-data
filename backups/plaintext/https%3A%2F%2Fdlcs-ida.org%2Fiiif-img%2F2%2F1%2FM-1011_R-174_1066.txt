The topography of the Zuni Reservation varies
considerably and is characterized by two main types
of land, i. e., the lower or valley areas and the
upland or mesa areas. The valley areas afford con
siderable farm land which the Zuni Indians use in
their agricultural pursuits. The me sas are in general
rolling and fairly flat and are characterized by
rocky canyons where the me sa breaks into the valleys.
These rocky slopes and deep canyons are practically
inaccessible to stock and are of little value for
livestock grazing or other purposes.
The annual precipitation is approximately 13
inches. The greater part of the annual rainfall comes
in the months of July and August.( Information ob
tained from Indian Irrigation Service records July,
1930- June, 1932). The summer rains generally are
sporadic and often fall in heavy downpours of short
duration. The winters are generally open with light
snowfalls varying from 12 to 30 inches throughout
the year.
The temperature of the Zuni region is not
extreme. The summer temperatures are generally not
excessively nigh, and 90 degrees is exceptional.
Winter temperatures are more severe however, and 20
degrees below zero is not uncommon.
