from the botton of the pipe in the ground, it is expected that the
water to supply them is to come from the present system, it can be
readily seen that with the present short supply, and the present
pressure that they will be a failure from the start.
I have no suggestions, or recommendations to offer, I must
confess I do not know, or even mus trust what to advise.
At the present time the small irrigation system here is
in good working order, all the water they have is being judiciously
used, all the land that can be reached by it is under cultivation.
From my personal observation, and from the testimony of
others who have known these people for a number of years, I am con
vinced that the average Navajo Indian is not a lazy body, on the
contrary, he is a worker, and is willing to work when he is convinced
by his labor fair results can be obtained. I am informed by what I
consider reliable authority that the Navajo Indians were paid by
the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Rail Road Company last year about
$ 70.000.00, for labor performed along the line of that rail road,
and that nearly all of that amount was spent by them in the sup
port of their families, they were so industrious, and gave such good
satisfaction that the rail road company want to employ more of them
during the present season, but the demand seems to be greater than
the supply. Quite a number of them are employed in the coal
mines at Gallup.N.M. and other places off the reservation.
I have known these Indians for a number of years, have
spent much time on, and been in nearly every part of their reser
vation, from what I have seen, I am convinced that if several of the
other Indian tribes did not receive from the Government more than
the Navajo's do, they would make more rapid strides towards civil
ization, and in a few years would improve their condition, be self
supporting, and make better citizens.
There are very few age ncies where the agent has better
control of his Indians than agent Hayzlette, he is kind, firm, uses
