1NARRATIVE.sootion 1.Lam and order, Con.d.Annual Roport, 1911.Pueblo Day Schools at Santa Fe, N.M.Danoos in the same form that have prevailed forhundreds of years are still in vogue in all tho Puoblos,Just what effect' thes6 dances havo upon the IndiansI have not had time to determine, but as they are said to beof a religious nature, it is not to be expected that the moraleffect thereof would be other than bonoficial, Social dancesare also held with more or less regularity.So far as possible the marriage and divorce lawsof the Torritory are obsorved in the Pueblos, but aftermarriage which is usually performed by a Priest, the Indianshave a ceremony of their own.Missionaries of the Catholic and PresbyterianChurches have charge of the religious welfare of theseIndians.I do not believe the Indians of these Pueblos are moreaddicted to the use of liquor than are other Indians, andI am ino lined to think there is a gradual improvement inthis respect in most of the Pueblos, while gambling does notprevail to any great extent.
