Annual Roport, 1911.
Pueblo Day Schools at Santa Fe, N.M.
Danoos in the same form that have prevailed for
hundreds of years are still in vogue in all tho Puoblos,
Just what effect' thes6 dances havo upon the Indians
I have not had time to determine, but as they are said to be
of a religious nature, it is not to be expected that the moral
effect thereof would be other than bonoficial, Social dances
are also held with more or less regularity.
So far as possible the marriage and divorce laws
of the Torritory are obsorved in the Pueblos, but after
marriage which is usually performed by a Priest, the Indians
have a ceremony of their own.
Missionaries of the Catholic and Presbyterian
Churches have charge of the religious welfare of these
Indians.
I do not believe the Indians of these Pueblos are more
addicted to the use of liquor than are other Indians, and
I am ino lined to think there is a gradual improvement in
this respect in most of the Pueblos, while gambling does not
prevail to any great extent.
