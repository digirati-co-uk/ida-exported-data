twenty and during the fiscal year 1918 eighteen births
were reported and of that number fiftyfive per cent died
within the fiscal year.
During the year ending June 30,
1919, there has been thirty seven births and of that number
fifty four per cent are living.
The past winter was one of unprecedented severity
and snow came in early November and the ground was
covered until the middle of March.
Influenza visited
the reservation and was prevalent in November and December
and fourteen deaths resulted, and it is not improbable that
the epidemic contributed to other later deaths.
In summary, it may be said that notwithstanding the
clouds of pessimism, superstition, indifference, tubercu
losis, general debility, and an excessive death rate
there are yet rays of encouragement.
An excellent
crop
year is promised, each and every ablebodied Indian has
remunerative employment, and with a prohibition that
prohibits drunkeness, there is above all and atmosphere
of success, activity, and contentment that stimulates
a belief that tribal misfortunes and bereavements of the
past are to serve as stepping stones for future betterment.
