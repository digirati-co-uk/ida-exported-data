I have
the honor

your
attention

the uncovered
platform
on the
North
side of the main
building
, and also
to estimate
enclosed
thoro
with giving
the cost
for material
and labor
to orect
a two- story
porch
over
the same,
I am anxious
to have this
work
dono
4 soon
as possible
, as it is
a much
needed
improvement
,
This
platforma
during
the whole
wintu
? Is covered
with ice 4 or 5
inches
thick
and it is absolutely
impossible
to provent
it; also
all
the timbers
in the platform
are motion
and it must
be torn
up, and I
consider
it for the best interest
at the dehool
to have
it replaced
with
a double
porch
and I respostrully
ask your favorable
conaider

of this
request
. It will requiro
