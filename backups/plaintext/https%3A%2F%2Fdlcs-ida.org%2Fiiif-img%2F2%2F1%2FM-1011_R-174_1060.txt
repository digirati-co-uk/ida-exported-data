reservoir the silt in the present Blackrock reservoir can be
washed out and the future of the irrigation project here be
assured for all time.
Again attention is called to the need of the sanatorium and the
agency for permanent improvements to be made upon the spring
which provides water for all uses here. The irrigation engi
neer has estimated that it will require$ 8, 500. 00 to place this
spring in a condition where ample water can be provided for our
use. It is necessary for pumping to be done several times each
day because of the condition of the arroyo in which this spring
is located and it is feared that unless early construction is
done here it will be necessary for us to close the sanatorium,
especially should a heavy flood come on the upper part of the
arroyo on which the spring is located.
The plans for future work with the adult Zuni Indians are in
corporated in the report by Mr. Nielson, the Agency farmer,
which is attached here to as Exhibit" A"
