The needs of the school are being set forth pretty muchin detail in my reply to Indian Office Circular No. 1798, whichwill perhaps reach the Office before this Annual Report. Thechief needs of the school are: A gymnasium; an ass anbly room;the doubling of the floor space of the present dining room, andthe adding of a top story to the same building, the first in orderto provide a proper amount of space for setting our tables for400 and upwards of pupils, and the second in order to properlyhouse our sewing department, which is at present in exceedinglycramped quarters over a portion of the Laundry. Then, too, weshould have about one more residential cottageAs regards our graduates, I may say that as a rule theysouthwest Indians andtherefore generally progressive The immediate outlook of mostof them a ontemplates a transfer to some school like HaskellorRiverside, or Chilocco, or Phonix, or Albuquerque, where theycan climb'a little higher still in their schoolwork.Practicallyall of this year' s graduating clas will continue their work elsewhere and most of them are still young enough that they can Ronishthe four- year course, say at Haskell, before reaching the age of 21.We have been holding pretty closely to the Course ofStudy. One subject, that of Masonry, has not been given a greatattention Daily outlines of instruction have not invariably prepared Nor do I agree with those who would mare thisan indispensable prerequisite to the beginning of any day' s workAs a general rule, a daily lesson plan, or outline, is a goodthing to have; but it is not indispensable. Our school r o onequipment is adequateThe books on the authorized list are satisfactory, I wasa meraber of the conmittee of superintendents and supervisors whopre d the list for printing in the 1923 Estimate. While it isere are s Orne books on that list that I would not order forany school under my immediate jurisdictistill, there is sufficient latitude in the 1ist that any one can find a satisfactorylineupAs a general rule, the employyes during the past yearhave been efficient or at least reasonably efficient, loyal andinclined to cooperate with one another in furthering the best interests of the school As in all school s of course there hasbeen some bickering, but we have to put up with that, except ingwhen it gets so bad as to interfere with a person' s usefulness inthe institution The relationship between this school and thepublic schools has been very cordial
