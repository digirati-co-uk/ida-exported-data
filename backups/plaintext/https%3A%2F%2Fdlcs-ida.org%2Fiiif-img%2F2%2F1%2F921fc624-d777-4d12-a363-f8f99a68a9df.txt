They have cooperated and seemed to work for thebest interests of the children and the school. A non- denominational service has been conducted Sunday evenings in the CharlesH. Burke hali, at which the priest and ministers of the town tookturns in talking to the entire student body. This is a popularand beneficial service, consisting of singing, the Lord' s Prayer,Scripture reading, and always a good moral talk.The disciplinarian has held meetings once a month of theofficers of the boys' battalion and companies to discuss varioussubjects influencing good discipline. Now apa then at thesemeetings light refreshments were served and it is believed thegatherings have resulted in the officers taking more interestand assuming more responsibility. Similar meetings were heldwith the girl officers and the results were equally good.3.1
