.... Law and Order
Simon A. Lay, Protestant missionary, instructs the Protestant
children at the school on Saturdays in the afternoon and they
attend Sunday school and church service at the churches of
their choice in town on Sundays.
The Catholic and Protestant missionaries in their work
with the pupils of the school have accomplished a great deal
of good. They have cooperated and seemed to work for the
best interests of the children and the school. A non- denomina
tional service has been conducted Sunday evenings in the Charles
H. Burke hali, at which the priest and ministers of the town took
turns in talking to the entire student body. This is a popular
and beneficial service, consisting of singing, the Lord' s Prayer,
Scripture reading, and always a good moral talk.
The disciplinarian has held meetings once a month of the
officers of the boys' battalion and companies to discuss various
subjects influencing good discipline. Now apa then at these
meetings light refreshments were served and it is believed the
gatherings have resulted in the officers taking more interest
and assuming more responsibility. Similar meetings were held
with the girl officers and the results were equally good.
