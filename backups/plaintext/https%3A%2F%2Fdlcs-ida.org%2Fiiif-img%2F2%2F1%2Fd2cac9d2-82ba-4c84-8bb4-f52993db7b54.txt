RestingZone“ Frightening"Living in the dormitory can be an interesting experience, because you meetmany people your own age. You learn tocooperate with others and you get a senseof what dorm living is like. The only difference is you can' t come and go as youplease. There is a curfew and a sign outsheet so the staff on duty know where youare at all times.The first night of living in the dorm is alittle frightening, especially for those whohave never been away from home. Everything is new and strange, the bed, theroom, and the people. Some may lie in bedthe first night and wonder about the nextday. The question that goes through manyminds is, “ How will the people here treatme? ” Some even get homesickand cry atnight, so they go home after the firstweek. Others find a sense of freedom andget use to living in the dorm.The dormitory is a fun place to live andlearn. It' s a place of sharing and caring. Itis a home away from home.– Tanya SuinaTop to bottom: Candice is working hard,can' t you tell? Two dudes take a break fromthe world. Adrian and Cory on their way tothe dorm. The “ Rowdyo ” commotion.
