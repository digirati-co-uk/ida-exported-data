The Jicarilla Apache are natural gamblers. Before the issue of sheeptheir idleness and poverty led to all kinds of dissipation. Since the issueof sheep gambling has decreased from year to year.Two Apache, two Navajo,a white man, and a Mexican were recently fined in the state court for gambling near the reservation, which will have a tendency to curb gambling on ornear the reservation.No important decisions during the year have been rend ored by the courtaffecting these Indians.The last state legislature passed a law with heavy penalty for dispensing or manufacturing liquor near an Indian reservation and otherwise modified existing laws relative to the manufacture and sale of intoxicatingliquor which should be of decided benefit in controlling the liquor trafficamong these people.
