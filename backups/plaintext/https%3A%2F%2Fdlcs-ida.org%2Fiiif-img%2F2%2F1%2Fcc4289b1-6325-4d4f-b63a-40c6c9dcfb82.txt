queMelsenA Criticism and Evaluation of the Present Curriculum.Since using the curriculum for one year I have found it very useful.Practically all of the work in the F, G and H Levels is practical, butit is very incomplete, We need better opportunities to carry out activities such as would improve the Home and Living Conditions, Health,Sanitation, Agriculture, Stock Raising, range management, grazing, erogion control, reservatbon citizenship, improvement of arts and crafts,camp cookery, Family relationships, Home Improvement, Increasing Income, Wise spending, need more emphasis.I think we need lots of time in order to make these suggestions unified yet more thorough.I suggest that the F. G. and I boys could be combined in an IndustrialClass where they might carry out some of the following objectives:To care properly for sheep, goats, poultry, and horses.To recognize good stock and to appreciate it sufficiently to getit later.To make erosion breaks, dams, and reservoirs.Tolearn the plants which should be encouraged.To learn of conservation activities on own reservation.( Fieldtrips)To know the value of erosion control and proper grazing.To know more about practical sanitation and health for reservationincluding diseases, their care and prevention.To construct suitable home furniture,To establish higher ideals for homes.To know more of local citizenship; also know how it correlateswith the state and federal government.To actually follow such proceedure as one would be compelled tofollow in home sanitation.
