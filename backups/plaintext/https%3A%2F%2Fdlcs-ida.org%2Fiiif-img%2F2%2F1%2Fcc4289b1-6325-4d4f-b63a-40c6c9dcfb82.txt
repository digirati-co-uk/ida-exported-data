A Criticism and Evaluation of the Present Curriculum.
Since using the curriculum for one year I have found it very useful.
Practically all of the work in the F, G and H Levels is practical, but
it is very incomplete, We need better opportunities to carry out act
ivities such as would improve the Home and Living Conditions, Health,
Sanitation, Agriculture, Stock Raising, range management, grazing, erog
ion control, reservatbon citizenship, improvement of arts and crafts,
camp cookery, Family relationships, Home Improvement, Increasing In
come, Wise spending, need more emphasis.
I think we need lots of time in order to make these suggestions uni
fied yet more thorough.
I suggest that the F. G. and I boys could be combined in an Industrial
Class where they might carry out some of the following objectives:
To care properly for sheep, goats, poultry, and horses.
To recognize good stock and to appreciate it sufficiently to get
it later.
To make erosion breaks, dams, and reservoirs.
Tolearn the plants which should be encouraged.
To learn of conservation activities on own reservation.( Field
trips)
To know the value of erosion control and proper grazing.
To know more about practical sanitation and health for reservation
including diseases, their care and prevention.
To construct suitable home furniture,
To establish higher ideals for homes.
To know more of local citizenship; also know how it correlates
with the state and federal government.
To actually follow such proceedure as one would be compelled to
follow in home sanitation.
