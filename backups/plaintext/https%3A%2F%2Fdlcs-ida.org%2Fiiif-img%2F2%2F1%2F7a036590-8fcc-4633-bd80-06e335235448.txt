Her hands were bound together with braideddeer skin rope. He saw that her look was very sad. He whisperedwords of cheer in her ear and told her that he had come to take herback home. The light of cheer came into her face.The feast was over at midnight. The warrior followed the twoguards to a certain wigwam. He stole quietly to the girl' s wigwamwhen he was sure every one was asleep. He crawled under the canvasand cut the rope with which her hands were bound, then gave her theknife so she could cut the tin fringes from the hem of her buckskindress. The noise which these made when she walked would betraythem. She crawled out from under the canvas and went with thebrave to where he had left the horses. They got on and rode towardshome. They almost completed the distance in a night' s travel.When dawn came the guards were shocked to find her bed empty.They awakened the whole camp, but their chief, knowing that thetwo refugees were safe, did not try to follow them.The Ute chief and his bride were very happy to be united again,and lived happily together ever afterwards.llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll||||ll||||ll|ll|-|-||-|-|-lllllllllll|-|-l|-|CPUI-||||-||||-||-||||-||-||||-||- 11- 11- II- II]||-||-||-- VII-| UI||||-||||-||||-|| ll- ll- IIIIIIIIIIIIII- 101- 1 II- III-||||||||||||||||||-||||||||||||||- II:willPage Thirty- nine
