The additional range would then permit the protection
of those areas on the reservation which are now
the main source of excessive soil erosion as well as
provide increased forage for the present flocks.
There are approximately 80, 000 acres of reser
vation lands badly infested with prairie dogs. It
is considered very essential for effective range
management and prevention of soil erosion to put on
an intensive program of rodent control. This should be
extended over a three- year period and it is estimated
that$ 15, 000 will be required for the work. An
effective rodent control program carried to completion
would ai√¢ materially in carrying in a range manage
ment program to successful completion. The acquire
ment of additional range lands, proper range manage
ment practice, the cuiling out of the old and low
productive animals, the infusion of new blood into
the riocks, and the elimination of the surplus goats
and wild horses all coupled with erosion and silt
control dams and increased water supplies would soon
put tae Zuni Indians on a much more self- supporting
basis.
Roads and Trails
There are no maps showing the location or only
the present used roads on the reservation. Due to
the lack of equi. pment and the newness of forestry
organization there, no new maps have been made showing
