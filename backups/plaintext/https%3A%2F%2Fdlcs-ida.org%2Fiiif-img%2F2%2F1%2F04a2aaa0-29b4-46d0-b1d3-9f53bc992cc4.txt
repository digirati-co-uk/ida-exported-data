Dear Juan Bernal:
I feel that I have a sad duty to perform to write you of the sud
den death of your little daughter. When I was at Taos' I wow nothing of
her 1llness; she was taken sick about the time I loft for Taos, Monday
Sept. 28th. Ir. Haggett, Assºt Supto, wrote me at taos of the girl's
111ness, but I never got the letter. Her illness was acute dysenontory
and all was done that could be to check same. The dootor and nurse vere
with the little sufferer constantly, and did allt human agenoles
could for her. I know that you are broken hearted; that anything I can
may will not lessen your grief; that you may blame me; the Gov't and
all, for a system that robs you of your little beloved, takes her from
you, only to send her back in á casket cold in leath. God knows that I
fee the accusation, just or un just. Nothing has ever happened at this
school to touch t.e heart of the teachers and others as this sad oase.
She died Friday night one hour after I reached home. I can blame no one,
all was done that could have been done. I can say nothing to
lesson
your sorrow; she was yours; your own; and God has seen fit to take her
home. My heart
bleeds for you in your affliction, and the tears
WO
' s hec. are not for
the little angel LUCHRA, but for you and the
flloted mo ther.
I am very truly,
