In planning for this level an effort was made to give workin accord with the principles of Education as given in theCurriculum for the Eastern Nana jo School; to give work thatwould be a help to the child in his home' environment.A number of the pupils of this group are well beyond the agefor this level. One reason for this retardation is late entrance.Timidity and self consciousness make it much more difficultfor such pupils to gain a mastery of English than for younger chilchildren.In planning for this group the need to give work that wouldlead to oral expression was ever in mind." Purposeful activitiesformed the basis for this work.As the curriculum is at present tentative the need to carefully evaluate each step was kept in mind in giving the workplanned.The following units of work were carried out:1.
