3.Any country town of six thousand people has from six to twelvedoctors. We have that many people scattered over a large territory in three States, much of which can be reached only onhorseback, and for a year and a half we have had one man to doit all. It follows that we could only reach the most seriouscases and that the medicine men handle most of the others.Presbyterian Mission hopes to secure a physician for their worksoon. They also have it in mind to build the hospital whichthey have talked of for more than two years and for which we gavethem a grant of land some time ago. This would help the medicalwork very much. We should have at least one more physician, tobe stationed at Aneth. There is no physician nearer than fiftyor sixty miles of Aneth and that vicinity. When the agency hospital is in full running order we will have to have at least onemore female employee and possibly two.We have no field matrons on this reservation and have nothad for a number of years. I understand they were not considered much of a suoce88 when they did have them. The conditionshere are such that only& woman of much more than ordinary ability could be of 186. The Presbyterian Mission is now negotiatingwith a woman they believe can do this kind of work mu Cessfully-especially here in the agenoy district where the population ismore fixed than at most points on the reservation. ReverendCampbell tells me this woman is in good health, an experiencedpractical nurse who has done settlement work and wants to cometo this work through a religiou8 conviotion that it is her dutyto do 80. This effort will be watohed with intereet and a report will be made as to its BUGG 688 next year.11.
