We have received only 125 vilitary caps, and this number will
supply only a little more than one half of the 200 boys now onrolled.
our supply of Kersey, or uniform cloth, has been received, and every
boy in the school will be provided with a uniforma suit in short time.
In order to have each boy properly uniformed, it is absolutely
necessary that the caps herein estimated for be furnished.
As soon as these uniforn suits are finished, each boy will be pro
videt forwith a new uniform suit and cap, which will remain the property
of the school for one year, when they will be issued for every day suits
The Matrons, and Disciplinarian are to take charge of these uniform
suits and allow them to be worn only on Sundays and such other days as
may be necessary.
