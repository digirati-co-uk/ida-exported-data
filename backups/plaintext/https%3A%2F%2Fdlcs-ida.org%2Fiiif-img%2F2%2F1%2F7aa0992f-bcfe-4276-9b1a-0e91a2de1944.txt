I wrote to Mr. Jaynes if it were regular for Mrs. Ferris to collect the rents on the storebuilding and to turn it over to Mrs. Manuel. He informs me that it isnot, that as administrator for the estate of the late A. D. Ferris Ishould collect the rents and hold them pending the final settlement.That he thinks it best tha", this money should pass thro my hands. Iwrote him as I feared that I might be held later accountable for thismoney, which under present arrangements, as you know, I have had nothingto do with.You are therefore appointed my agent to act for me in colloctingthe rente on the store building and opera houseand the old store buila-198, which I learn is not rented, andto place them to my credit asadministrator of the estate of A. D. Ferris. Please do mix this acct.with my personal account.You you may send me a slip when rents arecollected, but hold all money thus collected subject to my order, whichI will in turn disburse as provided by the will and the order of thecourt.I am very respectfully,Beranda
