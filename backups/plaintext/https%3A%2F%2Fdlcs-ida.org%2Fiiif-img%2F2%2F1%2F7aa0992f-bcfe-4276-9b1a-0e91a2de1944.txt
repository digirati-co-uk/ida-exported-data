Santa Fe, N. M., Nov. 24th, 1903,
Mr. E. W. Davies,
Pipestone, Minn.
Dear Mr. Davies:
I am in receipt of
a letter from Mr. F. L. Jaynes, whom Mrs. Porr
engaged as her attorney to look after her business. I wrote to Mr. Jay
nes if it were regular for Mrs. Ferris to collect the rents on the store
building and to turn it over to Mrs. Manuel. He informs me that it is
not, that as administrator for the estate of the late A. D. Ferris I
should collect the rents and hold them pending the final settlement.
That he thinks it best tha", this money should pass thro my hands. I
wrote him as I feared that I might be held later accountable for this
money, which under present arrangements, as you know, I have had nothing
to do with.
You are therefore appointed my agent to act for me in collocting
the rente on the store building and opera house
and the old store buila-
198, which I learn is not rented, and
to place them to my credit as
administrator of the estate of A. D. Ferris. Please do mix this acct.
with my personal account.
You you may send me a slip when rents are
collected, but hold all money thus collected subject to my order, which
I will in turn disburse as provided by the will and the order of the
court.
I am very respectfully,
Beranda
