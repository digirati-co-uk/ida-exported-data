failed to do to the school water- system in the winter
months, the sand carried in suspension by the water taken
from this canal accomplished during the
summer months.
Deposits of silt and sand several inches deep must be
removed almost daily from the flush boxes connected with
the toilets later- backs, in stoves and ranges, connected
with pressure heaters, plugged up solid, hence their use
was not attempted; water heaters, used to heet bath water
for pupils, plugged full and,
as a consequence, were al
most always out of commision, the suspended sand cut out
valves almost as rapidly as they could be installed, no
valve seat, no faucet could resist its eroding action.
The result was that for twelve months of the year, regard
less of expense of time and labor and money, the system
was in a deplorable condition; every toilet was almost
continually out of shape; every valve and faucet contin
ually leaked; water and sewer pipes were plugged with
nud and sand; and weter could be heated only in open
vessels.
In the late spring or early summer of 1925 a large
reservoir was constructed on the mesa above the school by
building a dam between the points of two hils, thus
inclosing a basin or valley which it was estimated would
hold in the neighborhood of 12 million gallons. This
reservoir was under the Hogback canal from which it was
proposed to fill it by gravity and the storage was thought
would prove sufficient to carry the schools through the
Winter nonths. Weter was first turned into the reservoir
about July first 1925 and the bottom and sides of the
reservoir developed many leaks. The dam itself developed
no leaks but the basin or valley in which it was proposed
to store water developed
many leaks, Naturally the silt
and sand carried by the water as it enters this reservoir
from the canal will ultimately seal the reservoir and
stop these leaks but this result had not been secured when
a cloud- burst, occurring on September 18th, placed the
canal out of commission at which time the reservoir was
but about one quarter or one third full. This storage sup
plied the needs of the schools until December first, when
it was exhausted, and water for all purposes, except
laundry purposes, must again be pumped from the SURFACE
WELL, The Hogback canal was not egain placed in operation
until the spring of 1926.
Ahon the pump was started on the surface well in early
