5- HopiEDUCATION:We have but one boarding school for Navajos- onthis reservation. Capacity, 170. Attendance this date, 178.We have about 400 eligible Navajo children not in any schoolthat should be enrolled at the Keans Canyon school, or in anotherschool like it, located at some other point on this reservation.The Navajos are strongly against sending theirchildren to outside, or Non- reservation, schools till they passthe sixth grade and are able to look after themselves and writeto their people. They ask that the Keans Canyon school be doubledin capacity or another such school built to care for all theirchildren of school age and carry them through the sixth or eighthgrade.Our Nava jos have counseled several times over thismatter of whether it would be best to have Day Schools or additionalBoarding School capacity for their children now out of school andhave definitely and carefully decided in favor of the BoardingSchool, which they believe will be more successful for them andfor the Government.The Hopi children are cared for to full school capacity,as all Hopi children of school age are in school. We have five suchday schools as follows: Polacca with 89 attendance; Toreva with 48;Chinopovy with 56; Oraibi with 61; Hotevilla with 100. Estimatedenrollment in these day schools for 1932: Polacca 100; Toreva 59;Chimopovy 63; oraibi 71; Hotevilla 106.-We have two Public Schools now functioning on thereservation one at Keams Canyon and one at Oraibi, with an Indianattendance as follows: Keans Canyon, 7; Oraibi, 8. We are payingfor 45 children in the Winslow public schools. The reservationpublic schools are also taking care of employees' children. TheIndian children in these Public Schools are those finishing ourlocal day and reservation schools, or children of Indian employees.We will start a public school at Hotevilla this fall, with theco- operation of the county superintendent of schools.The Keans Canyon Indian School should be increased to acapacity, or we should have new capacity, that woul√† take care ofall the Hopi Reservation Navajo children up through the eighthgrade sixth anyway. The Hopi schools should be completed in
