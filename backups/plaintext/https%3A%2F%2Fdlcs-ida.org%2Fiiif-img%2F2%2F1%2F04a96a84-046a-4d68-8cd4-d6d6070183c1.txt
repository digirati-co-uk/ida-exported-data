However there has been quite a 11ttletonsilitis during the latter part of the sohool year. TheIndians on the reservation are very healthy generally-- withthe exo option of obronio diseases such as trachoma, tuberoulosis, conjunctivitia, eto.Sanitary conditions at the Indians home are usuallyvery bad. Ono redooming feature is the fact that they seldomstay long in one location, being constantly moving from plao.to place with their flooks, and in this way he ve a clean homofrom time to time.As a result of the tour of inspection completed bythe agency paysio lan June 15, 1910, the work and influenceof the physiolan has been inoreased and has been more satisfactory. During the past year request for medical aia havecome from some of the Indians who have been staunoh adherentsto the" Medicine Men". In view of the fact that this closerrelationship has increased the usefulness of the agency physio fan, and has brought the Indian in closer topih with thework of the school and agency, it is considered that the year' swork will compare favorably with any preceding year.
