33;ANNUAL REPORT SANTA FE BOARDING SCHOOL, JUNE 30, 1924NARRATIVE SECTIONSection IIHealthA year ago, in my annual report, I said that it therecord for the following year should show a smaller numberof break- downs among the pupils, I felt that my surmisethat the number of such break- downs in 1922- 23 was due tothe sequelae of influenza was a correct one. I believe Iwas right. This year only four pupils broke down, as a gainsta dozen or more of the previous year. And of the Tour whobroke down, the case of one is directly and immediatelytraceable to an a ttack of measles. This pupil is herenow, sufIeringfrom pulmonary tuberculosis and her conditionis not at all reassuringIt is also very likely that the work of Dr. Perkinshere early in the school year, in the way or treating orremoving diseased tonsils, had much to do with the generalhealth or the pupils.There were no epidemics in the fiscal year. I fearedfor a time that we were going to have a general outbreak ofmeasles, but fortunately, and for reasons which I can notexplain only a few pupils came down with it All recoveredsatist actorily excepting the one child mentioned in thelatter part of the first paragraph aboveDr. Perkins was here from September on during severalmonths and operated a good many of our pupils for diseasedtonsils He also administered and directed the treatmentfor a considerable time of all pupils afflicted with trachoma I feel that if we could have our pupils here atthe school the year round, we could in the course of a reasonable length of time stamp out trachoma among them c ompletely. This, of course, would be brought about by operation and treatment of those afflicted and preventive measuresamang those not attacked But when, as is the case, thelarge majority of our pupils spend trom two to three monthsof every year in their home pueblos or villages, wheretrachoma is prevalent and no measures are taken to combatit, much of our work is set at nought.I don' t presume tp say whether trachoma came intothe schools by way of the Indian homes or whether it gotinto the homes by way of the school. Neither am I goingto say that on the whole the boarding schools are notspreading tra choma instead of reducing its incidence Butbe all that as it may, the present situation with which weare confronted is, it seems to me, that wa have to workboth ends of this proposition, if we want to make anyheadway in combating this veritable plague
