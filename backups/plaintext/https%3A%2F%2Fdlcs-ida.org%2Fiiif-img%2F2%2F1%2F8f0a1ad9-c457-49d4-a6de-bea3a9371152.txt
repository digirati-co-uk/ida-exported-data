NARRATIVEPageSection 1V. Industries.Annual Report, 1912.The Navajo Indians of this reservation, numbering about10, 000, are tenders of flocks and weavers of blankets. Theircattle, horses and sheep range over portions of New Mexico andArizona. These Indians are pastoral people and not farmers, althought every family has a small piece of ground where they growcorn, hay and vegetables. These small farms are irrigated by floodwaters from melting snow in the mountains. Owing to the lack ofsnow in the mountains and the extreme dry weather this year theircrops are very light. These people are progressive and intelligent. Not considering their crops, these people derive from thesales of their wool, stock and blankets nearly$ 500, 000 annually.Farming does not appeal to the Navajo very strongly, althoughmore land is being cultivated each year, which is very encouraging. The stock industry is their greatest source of income;everything is being done to improve this industry that is possible.This year these Indians were induced to buy over 300 stock ramsfor the purpose of upbreeding their flocks. They are learningthat it is more profitable to keep good animals than it is to keeppoor ones.These people are provided with wagons, mowers, harrows,plows, hay rakes, shovels, hoes, garden rakes, axes and mattocks.The se implements are issued to them and paid for in labor. Theseimplements are well cared for,With the exception of about 75 Indians, all are selfsupporting.
