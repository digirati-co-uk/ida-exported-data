-4The find ing of water in the Dakota sands tone by the GypsyOil Company in their well on the Tocito was a great disappointment, as this structure was looked upon with more favorthan any of the others and was ideal as to size, closure andapparent drainage area. Discussion of these factors willfollow later in this report.After the Gypsy Co. secured water in the Dako ta there waslittle hope left for the Table Mesa structure, 9 miles to thenortheast, although it was felt that possibly a rather prominent igneous dike in the syncline between the two structuresmight play a part in cutting off any migration of oil towardTocito from the eastern drainage area. With this hypothesisit might have been possible to explain an accumulation of oilin Table Mesa and none in Tocito. Several days later, however,the J. C. Bailey and Producers and Refiners well on Table Mesasecured a flow of sulphur water in the Dakota sandstone at1405 feet. The water encountered in the Gypsy well is goodfresh water.GENERAL NOTES ON GEOLOGY AND STRUCTUREIN THE SHIPROCK AREA OF THE RESERVATIONPractically the entire San Juan basin, in which Shiprockand the various structures under discussion are located, iscovered with deposits of Cretaceous age from the Ojo Alamosandstone, the top member of the Upper Cretaceous, to theDakota sandstone group, the basal member of the Lower Cretaceous, comprising a stratigraphic thickness of approximately6600 feet.The regional dip of all the formations in the west partof the basin in general is toward the northeast, east orsoutheast, carying from 1 to 5 degrees, except in closevicinity of the Great Hogback, where dips of from 14 to 33degrees may be found.The Great Hogback is located at theeastern edge of the Navajo Treaty reservation and is composedof the Mesa Verde formations tilted and' eroded to such an extent that it protrudes above the surrounding pla in of softerMan cos shale,The structural features of the basin are undoubtedly dueto local uplifts caused by the Carrizo Moun ta ins to the west,a group of intrusive volcanics of considerable importance, andthe La Plata Mountains to the northeast. Ute Mountain, a largeigneous plug southwest of Cortez, has also perhaps had considerable influence. In fact, the whole highland- mountain areaalong the Atizona and New Mexico border, of which the Carrizosand Ute Peak are the most prominent features, is very probably
