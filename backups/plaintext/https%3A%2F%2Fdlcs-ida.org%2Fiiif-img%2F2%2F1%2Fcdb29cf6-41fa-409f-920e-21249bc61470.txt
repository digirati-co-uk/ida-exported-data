SynopsisofReport of Inspector Gardneron theMescalero Agen cy.( Cowart, Agent)000October 13, 1886.A very small port ion of the reserve is susceptible of cultivation, and that portion which can be cultivated requires irrigation.It is estimated that from 4,000 to 5,000 acres are susceptible ofcultivation, by irrigation, but is so located that it almost impossible to get wat er upon it.During the present season the Indians have had under cultivation on the South Fork and at Three Rivers, about 300 acres,principally in corn, with a few a cres of wheat and potatoes,pumpkins, etc.Some few of the Ind ians gave their crops goodattention, whilst others almost entirely neglected their fields,and the labor of cultivating them fell upon and was done by theAgency employes.The Mescaleros are somewhat excusable for thisfrom the fact that of the 92 male adults reported in census forthe present fiscal year, 48 of them were enlisted as scouts andabsent from the reservation on military duty.Not so with theJicarillas.But 4 of their number were so enlisted and absent onmilitary duty, yet those remaining upon the reserve did very littletowards farming, practically nothing, and I am very sorry to say,as I firmly believe, they never will do any thing upon this reservation.A certain portion or band of the Jicarillas under oneAugustine, have not worked or will not work within the reserve.They were brought upon this reserve against their free will some4 years ago, and since which time they have done no good towardsself- support, but have consumed most of their time in idleness,
