2- Commissioner
.
Domingo
Valdez and his children
have lived upon the lands
from 1742
to the present
time.
The property has never been in
litigation
,
The Valdez descendents
are alll here; are few and
very old people.
In 1885, when the school was established
, the
holders
of deeds
of the several
parcels
constituting
the school
tract each conveyed
his interes
to the United
States
except the
United
States
University
of New Mexico
. Mr. Smith, who was then District
At
torney
for New Mexico
, forwarded
to the Indian Office
his endorse
ment
of an abstract
of the land and the office
seems
to assume
that
the Government
has titles
to sever
of the eight parcels
of
land of which
the school
farn is composed
,
It is obvious
that
this
is an error
.
For, it seems that
these
conveyances
were
based
upon different
conveyances
from Jose Valdez
( son of Domingo
Valdez
, the original
grantee
), from thirty
to sixty
years
ago.
Jose Valdez
was only one of five children
.
They all held the
property
in commor, no division
having ever been made by the heirs
of Domingo Valdez.
Thus
it seems that
there is an outstanding
large
undivided
interest
in every part of the school
tract still
vested
in the brothers
and sisters
of Jose Valdez.
So far as I have been able to learn them these
are the
facts.
That the Government's
title
to these
lands
shall
be good,
it will
be necessary
to secure
quit
claim
deeds
from all the heirs
of Domingo
Valdez
who
still
hold undivided
interests
in the land.
