4- HopiKeans Canyon. This is a very important need, for our housingfacilities are not at all sufficient. We will need a comfortablecottage, also, for the Keans Canyon field nurse, to be appointedthis year.A new car is needed for the field matron at Hotevilla.A small ambulance is badly needed for use at thegeneral hospital. It would help our work very much.Something should be done about the damaging influencesand practices of the Navajo and Hopi Medicine men, if possible.The initiative should be taken by the Office.Dr. Larsen says we need two Solariums( sun parlors)for patients, owing to our long winter weather, and suggests thatthey be built just as soon as we can get funds for them. By placingthem at advantageous points they would not only increase theefficiency of the hospital, but would be the means of holding Indianswho now have to be sent home as soon as convalescent. We have noparlors or sitting rooms and patients sit out doors when convalescing.Can the Office do anything for us about this need?E. K. M.
