Fort Defiance, Ar. T., Dec. 24. 1894.Sir:-This reservation is about two hundred by one hundred and seventyfive miles; containing over twelve thousand square miles, and largerin area than the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut.Not nore than two per cent of the land is suitable for agriculturalpurposes; about sixty percent, for craringi the remainder rooks andsandy plains.No correct census of the Indians on this reservation, has been takenand the population is variously estimated from sixteen to wenty- fourthousand; wien chey returned from Port Svaner, years ago, tiere werefourteen thousands and in the opinion of tiose best informed theyhave not increased since tiat time. I do not tilink there are nowon the reservation excec√ºing eight tito usand; tie balance are scatteredthrougliout New Mexico, Utai. Arizona and Colorado. I do not ltink tisatit will ever be possible to control and civilize tienis until the reservation is reduced down to about one- fourth of its present size; andthis in my opinion will leave them sufficient ground for all agricultural and grazing purposes; and thus located, they can receive tiecare and attention of the agent, tire benefit of tie schools, and theadvantage of being surrounded by white farmers,The object of amking this reservation so large, was that theymight have abundant pasturage for their horses cattle and sheep; theynow lave but few cattle, their ponies are wititout value; and the numberof their sheer has large ly lecreased; and many oi' then now isave theirflocks off the reservation; a. a I can see no reason why they shouldivave so large an area of land. It 16 a pouitive injwy to them antisarkisenwill not settle down upon any fixed habitation; but roam about fromplace to place.They are bow in distress for want of food, but I understand thattile de partnent is making provision to relieve them by furnishing themwith bread; I also understand iliat a requisition has been made tofurnish them with a certain uumber of wagons, Plows, farming implements& c. If this is done, the Agent sitould be insructed to turn them over
