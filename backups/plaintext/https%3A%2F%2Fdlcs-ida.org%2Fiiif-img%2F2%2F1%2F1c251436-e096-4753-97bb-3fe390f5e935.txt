Pueblo Day Schools at Santa Fe, N.L.
On June 1, 1911 I assumed charge of the Northern group
of Pueblos of Now looico, formerly under chargo of the
Superintendent Santa Fe, N.M., Indian Industrial School.
There are no build ings pertaining to the Santa Fe Agonoy.
It is proposed to lease suitable buildings oithor at Santa
To, N.u., or some other convenient place, for the accommodation
of the Suporintendent, four Agenoy employees, office, warehouse
and stables,
The Pueblos und er this superintendency are as follows,-
Taos, Piouris, San Juan, Santa Clara, San Ildefonso, Mambo,
Pojuaque, Tosuque, Santo Domingo, Cochiti, Jomez and sia;
containing a total population of 3302. The Indians of those
Pueblos own their land in common under a grant from Spain,
the land grant of each of the Pueblos having been somewhat
reduced and confirmed by the United States,
Each Pueblo has a local form of government consisting
of a Governor and Council and order is maintained by them,
but at times the aid of the Territorial officials is needed,
in other than minor offenses.
All of the Pueblos have their set fiesta days when open
house is kept for the day, and numerous visitors aro enter
tained.
