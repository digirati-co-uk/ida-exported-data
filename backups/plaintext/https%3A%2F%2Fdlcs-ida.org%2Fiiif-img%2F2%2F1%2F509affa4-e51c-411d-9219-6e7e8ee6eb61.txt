They burned the hogan up.The stones did not burn.Occupations at home wereddiscussed and some of them carriedout at school.Since sheep raising and blanket weaving are thechief occupations, the children became interested in and carriedout these activities. They sheared a sheep skin, washed the wool,dyed some of it, carded the wool, made spindles, spun some yarn, sstudied and drew Navajo designs, and made small rugs. A study ofcolors and measuring was appropriate at this time. Some of theboys built a small trading post which led to a study of moneyvalues, articles to be sold and price, making of things to sell,and silver work.Some of the boys made rings and bracelets ofcopper wire while two others made concho belts of soft tin.Discussions of the use and habits of the sheep, goat, dog,cat, and horse led to a study of animals and plants native to thisstate.Sinoe many of the group had asked to make picture bookletsto take home, they decided to draw pictures of native animals totake home.While carrying out Navajo life activities, the class composedstories about these activities which illustrate the improvementin ability to express themselves.Below are some of these compositions:Harold made a spindle.Harold sawed a board like a wheel.He made a stick straight.He made a hole in the wheel.Then he put the stick in the hole.
