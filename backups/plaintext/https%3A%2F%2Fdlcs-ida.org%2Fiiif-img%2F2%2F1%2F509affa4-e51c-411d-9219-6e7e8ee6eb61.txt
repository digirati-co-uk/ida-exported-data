They burned the hogan up.
The stones did not burn.
Occupations at home wereddiscussed and some of them carried
out at school.
Since sheep raising and blanket weaving are the
chief occupations, the children became interested in and carried
out these activities. They sheared a sheep skin, washed the wool,
dyed some of it, carded the wool, made spindles, spun some yarn, s
studied and drew Navajo designs, and made small rugs. A study of
colors and measuring was appropriate at this time. Some of the
boys built a small trading post which led to a study of money
values, articles to be sold and price, making of things to sell,
and silver work.
Some of the boys made rings and bracelets of
copper wire while two others made concho belts of soft tin.
Discussions of the use and habits of the sheep, goat, dog,
cat, and horse led to a study of animals and plants native to this
state.
Sinoe many of the group had asked to make picture booklets
to take home, they decided to draw pictures of native animals to
take home.
While carrying out Navajo life activities, the class composed
stories about these activities which illustrate the improvement
in ability to express themselves.
Below are some of these compo
sitions:
