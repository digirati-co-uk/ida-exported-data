Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Page 2.The whole census work is a matter of education of theIndians to the point where they will cooperate in every instance, and when that time arrives this work will be verymuch simplified and our census would then be reliable. Theonly way under present conditions that a correct censuscan be kept at any jurisdiction of the Navajo tribe is acomplete check annually, which in every instance would takeseveral months to a year at least. As the majority of theIndians are unallotted, there is nothing to tie their official names and numbers to the records of the Agency exceptthe census.If this tribe is paid annuities annually, it wouldthen be an easy matter to keep check on every individualfor he would then know the importance of his official number and the necessity of reporting births in order to havethem. enrolled and share in the distribution of tribal funds.Very respectfully,S.7.
