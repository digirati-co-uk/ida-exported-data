Alberquerque school10The shoe shop is practically idle for want of sole leather, nonew work can be made, and no shoes can be repaired where sole leatheris required In the harness shop nothing has been done for a mon.th for want of leather Febuary 14th, 1900, superintendent Allenwrote the Commissioner of Indian Affairs requesting that 400 lbs,oak sole leather, and 700 lbs, harness leather be sent this school.An invoice was received under date of Febuary 27th, 19 00, fromthe Chicago warehouse for 403 lbs, oak sole leather, another invoicewas received from the same place dated Febuary 28th, 1900 for 706 lbs,harness leather. The leather not coming to hand, SupervisorHolland acting superintendent wired the Chicago warehouse April 13,1900, and received a reply that it had not been shipped.On April 14th, 1900 he wrote the Commissioner of Indian Affairsinforming him of the facts as above stated, he received a reply underdate of May 4th, 1900, which said," this office has taken such stepsas will most likely secure prompt shipment and delivery of the shoeand harness leather Up to date no leather has come to hand, isthere not some way by which this leather can be furnished this school? it is badly needed.I examined the boo and accounts of the school, and think themcorrect, I thin all funds receivedby the superintendent have beenjudiciously expended after proper authority had been granted, and allMoneys properly accounted for. I ex amined the open market purchases.While they are numerous, the conditions here are such that they couldcould not have been avoided. In making such purchases the superintendent has invited proposals for the articles required, which havebeen furnished by the lowest bidder. I think the prices paidwere fair and reasonable, and no favoritish was shown in makiing thepurchases, and no extra expense was incurred in making themSince writing my report regarding employees, I wish to add anoccurrence which I think should be reported to the educationaldivision.
