Health and Sanitation: while the work on health and sanitationis good many of the things outlined for will be difficult ofaccomplishment in the Indian homes. Water is scarce; must inmany instances be hauled many miles. Larger hogans- morerooms giving better air and privacy, screened windows, andoutdoor toilets are mentioned in the curriculum. It will, however,be almost impossible for most of the Indians to secure the materieal to make these improvements., Screened windows might be accomplished at a minimum cost by the use of mosquito net.Disposal of body wastes should be stressed; especially in epidemics. Wastes should be burned or buried where they cannot affect the water supply. If an outdoor toilet is used definite instruction relative to its care should be given. If not properly cared for it may prove a source of contagion,Provision might be made for teachers to visit the homes ofthe Indians and thus learn first hand of the living conditionsof their pupils.Manual Training: It seems to me there should be provision madefor the boys as well as the girls to secure manual training.Many of the children in my group are well beyond the agefor this level. In a class of thirty- two, twenty are thirteenand above. Several are fifteen and over. Late entrance and alow I.Q. are probably the chief causes of this retardation.–ênumber have, seemingiy, reached a place where they can no longerbenefit much from classroinstruction.This opinion is sustainedby other teachers who have had them. These conditions exist,so I am told, in at least one other class- room. Many of theseboys like to work with tools and show a real aptitude for thastype of work. It seems to me there should be provision madefor them to do this type of work under a competent instructor.Language: Thesecchildren have difficulty with the forms of thepronouns. It seems to me that mention should be made of this andremedial work recorrmended,One of the objectives under written English is," To develop power to write independentlya few short, clear,related sentences on a chosen topic." I would go farther andsay," To know that these constitute a paragraph: The childshould in this level, I think, be taught to recognize the paragraph and be able to give the central thought. He should bemade aware of margins and indentations,
