Cliff Palace Mesa Verde National Park
MESA VERDE NATIONAL
PARK
The South west portion of the United States con
tains many ruins of dwellings and other structures
left by prehistoric people who had reached a high
degree of civilization long before the discovery of
America.
Of all the groups of these ruins, those on the
Mesa Verde, in Montezuma
Couniy, sou.hwestern
Colorado, 175 miles north of Gallup, are conceded
to be the largest, best preserved, and most pictur
esquely situated.
Many of these prehistoric ruins have been re
stored. The Cliff House is the largest of the Com.
munity houses. It is located
in a big cave, high
above the bottom of Cliff Canyon, and has twenty
two round kivas. Spruce Tree House
has 114
rooms and eight kivas. The Sun Temple, unearth
ed in 1915, and built on the top of the Mesa,
is a fine example of Mesa Verde architecture
, the
masonry being unusually good.
The beautiful
scenery, the invigorating
air, and
the camp life, with its maximum of freedom and
minimum
of discomfort
, rival the prehistoric
re.
mains themselves
in tending to make
a vacation
spent here of great value to the individual and one
long to be remembered.
Ample equipment
is available for all kinds of
trips to points of interest at nominal cost. Just
