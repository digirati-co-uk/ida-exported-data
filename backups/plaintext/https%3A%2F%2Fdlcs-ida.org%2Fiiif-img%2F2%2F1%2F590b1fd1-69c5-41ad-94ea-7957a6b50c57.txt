The pueblo is located on a small mountain stream and the
Indians have practice√§ irrigation here for generations.
Their original canals were constructed centuries ago and
little work has been done for improvement, maintenance, and
operation for their one hundred fifty acres in cultivation.
Inaccessible as is their location, they grow crops only
for subsistence. They spend eighty to one inundred days in
this subsistence farining and gardening, and tribal idleness
and consequent delinquencies characterize the other seasons
of the year.
With the availability of compensation funds from Lands
Board settlement it is hoped that some considerable acreage
of lands lost to the Indians may be recovered by purchase.
Litigation has retarded settlement of title, and until
patents are issued no purchases can be made.
The use of intoxicating liquors is a serious stumbling
block in this pueblo and the pueblo officials are usually
very lax in any effort for suppression. While the pueblo
shows a slight increase in the past thirty years it rated
third of the seven northern pueblos in 1790; fourth in 1350;
fifth in 1900; sixth in 1920; and seventh in 1932.
Recovery of some of the lands through purchase may
give these Indians encouragement, more production, and
better occupation, without which there is little promise,
but carly extinction. Fortunately there is a tribal awalcen
ing and their privations, delinquencies and tribal decimation
may prove educatory and they will look to their better
industrial application to rout disease, supplant poverty,
and promote tribal growth.
