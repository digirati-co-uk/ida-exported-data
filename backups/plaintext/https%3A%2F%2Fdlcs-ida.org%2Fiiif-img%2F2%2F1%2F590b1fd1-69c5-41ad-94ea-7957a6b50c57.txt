PICURISThe Pueblo of Picuris is fourteen miles east of thirtysix miles north of Santa Fe, and being fifteen miles fromthe Taos- Santa Fe highway, is the most inaccessible of theNorthern Pueblos.Population112Grant 17, 647 acresElevation 7000 to 3000 ft.Rainfall 12- 15 inchesThe pueblo is located on a small mountain stream and theIndians have practice√§ irrigation here for generations.Their original canals were constructed centuries ago andlittle work has been done for improvement, maintenance, andoperation for their one hundred fifty acres in cultivation.Inaccessible as is their location, they grow crops onlyfor subsistence. They spend eighty to one inundred days inthis subsistence farining and gardening, and tribal idlenessand consequent delinquencies characterize the other seasonsof the year.With the availability of compensation funds from LandsBoard settlement it is hoped that some considerable acreageof lands lost to the Indians may be recovered by purchase.Litigation has retarded settlement of title, and untilpatents are issued no purchases can be made.The use of intoxicating liquors is a serious stumblingblock in this pueblo and the pueblo officials are usuallyvery lax in any effort for suppression. While the puebloshows a slight increase in the past thirty years it ratedthird of the seven northern pueblos in 1790; fourth in 1350;fifth in 1900; sixth in 1920; and seventh in 1932.Recovery of some of the lands through purchase maygive these Indians encouragement, more production, andbetter occupation, without which there is little promise,but carly extinction. Fortunately there is a tribal awalcening and their privations, delinquencies and tribal decimationmay prove educatory and they will look to their betterindustrial application to rout disease, supplant poverty,and promote tribal growth.
