expanding and growing!
The computer, digital camera,
scanners and Internet keep SFIS
students current in computer
literacy.
SFIS is a great community
to be a part of!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Santa Fe Indian School was happy
to present an outstanding
original play by our Senior,
Amanda Montoya.
" Trapped Between Two Worlds"
encompassed students on and
off the stage. Ms. Nathan reeled in
wrap- around SFIS talent for the
play.
Thanks to all who helped with
the play and those who attended!
Trapped Between Two Worlds
commanded great stage acting.
