Page 14NARRATIVE.Annual report- 1915.Section 1v- Industries.The issue of farm implemente and wagons has beencontinued this year and should be for some time yet. Theseare issued for labor to an amount equal of their cost.Some work has been done on roads and at a recentcouncil lately it was decided by the leading men to requirelabor from each male, adult Indian on the roads. This I regardas very important step forward.More and better water should be developed which willrequire time and funds. Some work was done on old ditches.Improvements are generally good considering their isolatedlocation and means of building. There are no individualallottments on the reservation.The stock raising industry is the important featureon this reservation. The Navajo herds are increasing and withgood wool prices and range better than heretofore good resultsare anticipated this season. Heavy losses were sustained onaccount of the severe winter. Every acre is utilized by theIndians themselves and there is no room for lessees.There are some good horses which are being improved bythe purchase of grade stallions. There are too many ponystallions but these are gradually being done away with whenconditions permit.
