OU LOOK MARVELLOUS!You look simply marvellous! From as far as time permits there hasalways been fashion. Some might say, “ What is fashion, anyway?"Fashion is simply a statement of expression of one' s personality. Fashionis the way we want to dress from day to day. Fashion changes quicklyfrom month to month, year to year. Fashion in the simpliest way is like abig revolving circle of time. The popular fashions years ago will eventually be “ in style ” again. So the clothes that your parents have saved inold trunks, covered with moth- balls, for years, can be worn againwithout people snickering. So start saving and maybe one day you canopen your own fashion store.— Cyn Montoya24
