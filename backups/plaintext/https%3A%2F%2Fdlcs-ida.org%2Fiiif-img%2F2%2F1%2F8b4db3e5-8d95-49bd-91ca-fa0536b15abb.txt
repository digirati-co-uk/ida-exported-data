The Hogback project has demonstrated that the development of
any large irrigated acreage is costly in its initial expense as
well as subsequent maintenance.
Any similar project on this reservation, in the near future,
would seem inadvisable.
It would appear more expedient to pro
vide for the conservation of flood waters in different sections
of the reservation where conservation methods are either lacking
or inadequate.
There has been very little use of reimbursable funds to date.
Alfalfa seed, fence posts and wire have been purchased with reim
bursable funds and are now on hand for issue.
Range conditions under which the Indians must raise and
keep th
horses will not permit the use of heavy work animals.
The Indians have no use for heavy work animals of the Percheron
type.
It is generally conceded by those familiar with local
conditions that the Morgan horse is best adapted to the reser
vation.
A limited number of Morgan stallions are in uso on
the reservation.
No attempt bas been made to require the Indians to do
road work without compensation, but they are enct≈ëraged to do
10.
In several instances they have contributed considerable
labor to road repairs. The Indians are so widely scattered
that it would be very difficult to enforco compulsory road
work.
