Dear Sir:
In repay to your letter of the 22nd Inst., I would state that
suits.school building and main building there is considerable space
twear the ground and under side of joists of first floor; in parts of the
tin budaing this space may reach six l'est, varying from that to noth
There is almost no space under the employees' building.
In cxohvating, the only stone to be encountered will be the wells of
i inne parsed through.
in regard to prices of materials:- the price or brick would bo$ 7.00
0 08.00 per v.- not over the latter figure delivered at the school. The
De used in this region, are furnished by the New Mexican Penitentiary,
Cement is worth$ 5.00 to$ 6.00 per bbl., lime is
wort about 30 o. per bushel in small quantities, building stone is worth
about# .00 a cord, while building lumber is worth about$ 20.00 per.
my possibly be to your advantage to correspond with Mr. Anthon
ya Windsor, a contractor of Santa Fe, in regard to the construotion or
the building. I do not think he has figured on the building, but his
26. lerom in work at this place might prdve of value to you.
