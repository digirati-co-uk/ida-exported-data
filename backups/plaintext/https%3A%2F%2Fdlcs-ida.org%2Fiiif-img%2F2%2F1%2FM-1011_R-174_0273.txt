The present field natron has more than she can do in
the pueblo of Zuni
The field matron directs her energies to the
teaching of simple health rules, the proper care end
diet for children and invalids, cleanliness of the home
etc
To successfully reach the Indian women the
field Inatron makes frequent visits to their homes, shows
a personal interest in their affairs, their problems
and their work, aiding and advising them in every way
possible. She is meeting with a reasonable degree of
Success.
The field matron spends all of her time visit
ing the families living in the pueblo of uni. Calling
on those who need her, nore frequently than others.
Practically all of the Indians live in the pueblo during
the winter months and about one half during the summer
the field natron lives at the Zuni pueblo.
Her quarters are very limited and unsatisfactory. Needless
to say she is not accomplishing as much as if she were
provided with a suitable building in which to work with
the Indians. She should have a good building, constructed
by the government, containing living quarters, a visiting
room, 2 bath and a couple of work rooms for the Indians.
