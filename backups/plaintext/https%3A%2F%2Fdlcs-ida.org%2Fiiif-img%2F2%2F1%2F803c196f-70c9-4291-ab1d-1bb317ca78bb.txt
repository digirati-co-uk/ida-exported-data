It will thus be seen that the growing season is a very short one.
Agriculture and fruit- growing are menaced by cold nights throughout
the summer and late spring flarebacks. This winter season, that
may begin in October and last until the end of the following May,
presents many handicaps to the prompt transportation of Government
stores. All supplies must be brought from railroad by Indian teams.
The months of December, Jamary and February usually bring transporta
tion problems, and there have been years in which no freight was
hauled during this season. If any construction work is planned,
it must be handled between May 1 and September 30, as one cannot
anticipate good weather for building( especially rock and concreto
work) during any other part of the year. And as this is the time
when one fiscal year closes and another must be opened, the financial
condition of the agency being at its lowest obb, it is most difficult
to accomplish anything, and certainly impossible to hold labor with
hopok or promises.
The early summer soason 18 usually dry, and this is the period
when terrific wind and sand- storms are experienced. Any attempt
to describe an Arizona desert sand- storm 18 received by those who
have not seen one as the effort of a lanchausen. Once an Easterner
18 caught in such a storm, he promptly sinks below the Arizona
level and becomes two Kanchansens. The experiencv weakens ono
morally. These driving, cutting sand- storms, accompanied by the
burning wind, check and often ruin such crops as the Indians hope
for. After one such sand- storm, a profitable field may remain
a waste, providing it has actually remained in the country.
The
Indians sometimes go looking for it over in Utah. Water- Supply
Paper No.380, entitled" The Navajo Country," by Prof. Herbert E.
Gregory, issued by the United States Geological Survey, will
confirm the most extravagant statement with respect to soil in
place, precipitation, evaporation, etc.
