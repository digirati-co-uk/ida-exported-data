In the fiold are one government purse and two Eastern Askooiation pursos. One of these has been located at Nava about a year andthe other at Redrock just recently.The agency hospital not running to capacity without any fieldwork boing done is poorly constructed and wholly inadequate. It islocated in the flood zone, where every three or four yoars the watergets thror or four foot doop. The equipment is poor, and the conditionof the building would not justify any repairs or enlargement. Thefoundation is bad, and the building itself being a wooden structure, isvirtually a fire trap. The hospital consists chiefly of two large wardswith no call system, no isolation, no storage rooms, no refrigeration,antiquated plumbing, a heating plant that will have to be replaced within a year, its water supply for both drinking and kitchen use having tobe hauled twenty- five miles, and its light being provided by a Kohlerplant of small capacity and in such bad need of repair that it will haveto be replaced within the next year.The Toadlena hospital, though it is a frame structure with agood heating plant, with a good water supply, and in good repair, isnot equipped to handle anything but medical cases of not very seriousnature, As it has no equipment besides beds, a few simple instruments,and drugs, it is suitable only as an infirmary.Before any more can be done with the matter of health in thisjurisdiction, it will be necessary to build hospital facilities to takecare of the already crying needs that have been felt without any fieldwork having been done. By having one medical officer and an ambulancemaking regular trips to these isolated communities where the fieldnurses can direct him to the sick cases, we should be able to fill ahospital and a sanitarium of 175 beds, as in the twelve months of ourwork in this jurisdiction we have had to turn away many tubercularpatients and at times general patients for lack of hospital facilities,Il we expect to do anything with the tuberculosis situation among theNava jos, it will be necessary first of all to hospitalize the terminalcases, not with the idea of securing a cure or an arrest but to getthem away from their families and friends,To go on as in the past seeing many Indians, carelessly prescribing and dispensing, giving the Indian any kind of medicine he asksfor, which has only too frequently been done, without giving him thebenefit of surgery or careful examinations, without giving him somethingtangible that he can see is superior to what the medicine man can givehim, we are really only making a bad situation worse, It is the medicine man, averaging one in every ten in the population, who with hisgreat hold on the people is largely responsible for the pauperiz ing ofthe navajos. For the hospital to do some thing to replace his influencerather than to play into his hands will strike at the fundamental evil,socially, morally, and economically, among the Navajos today.We propose that there be built at the agency a hospital, aseventy- five bed general and a one hundred bed sanitarium constructedtogether with the same heating plant and kitchen facilities for both.The equipment should be modern, including X- ray, surgery, obstetricdepartment, and orthopedic ward.
