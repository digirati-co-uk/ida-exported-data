Hopi Indian Agency
at the Agenoy and at the day schools.
This is an urgent
need.
It has been said& number of times that the Hopi day
schools
are getting
the best results of any schools
in the
United
States
Indian Service
. They are surely
doing great
work among the Hopis. They work to meet the needs not only
of the children
but of the entire Hopi communities
as well.
They are simply a part of the Hopi communities
.
They wiela
such an influence
that these schools
are probably
more effective
and far- reaching than any other class of schools
in the United
States. They are getting results
which are very creditable
to
the employees
and to the government
, which is shown in the con
tinued
improvement
of their communities
, At the beginning
of the
school year the Navajo boarding
school at Keams Canyon will fur
ther extend this idea, to the Navajo homes. We have always
en
couraged
the Nava jos to make this school their school, to visit
the class rooms and different
departments
, and to come often to
see their children
and what we are doing with them. We believe
we are having gratifying
results with this school because
of
this attitude
, and that this school is helping
the Nava jos in
the same manner as that in which the day schools
are helping
the Hopis
.
During the past year we have put special emphasis
on health
work and home improvement
, and we believe that the schools and
employees
have been of material
assistance
in improving
the
health and the sanitary
conditions
among the Indians of both
tribes. As above stated, the health work this year has been
very greatly
improved
over any in past years.
Intermingling
of the two tribes
is continually
on the in
crease
. While we have some friction
, the tribes are getting
friendlier
and friendlier
where they are throw in touch with
one another. There is practically
no trouble between the
Indians
and whites.
The expense for the past fiscal year has been more than
usual on account of the many epidemics
and the great amount of
sickness
. This illness has more or less affected
the conduct
of the work among the Indians. Each year we are getting
&
little bit more money for needed
improvements
and are putting
it to good advantage
. Each year sees more work done for the
Indians
and greater progress
made by the Indians
. It also
sees
better physical
conditions
among the school plants and Agency.
We have very fine playground
apparatus
at all the schools, and
it is continually
being used when schools are in session. We
have no systematic
supervision
of playground
activities
. The
girls have the same facilities
that the boys have, and at the
boarding school they have playground
apparatus
in connection
with their
dormitory
.
