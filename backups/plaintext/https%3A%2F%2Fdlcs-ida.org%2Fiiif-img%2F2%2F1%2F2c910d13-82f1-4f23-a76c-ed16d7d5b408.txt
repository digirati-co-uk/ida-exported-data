HOPI INDIAN AGENCY

Section V..
Allotments
Allotment work was attempted in the past but none of
these allotments are marked or kept at the present time,
I do not think it practicable to suggest allotment to
these Indians.
I do not know under what act the allotment of this
reservation was attempted.
Neither do I know how far the work progressed, only I
do know that the Indians were very much dissatisfied with
the work.
Allotments for this land should not start until timo
for opening of the reservation.
We do not have any surplus lands or lands not now
used. All the lands are used by the tribes.
We have no lands open to settlemont. This reservation
as made by exeoutive order is still intact.
We have no allotments on the publio domain. We administer
Just on the land within the boundaries of the Hopi reservation.
