Many have battle. All have horses. I estimate that the allottedIndians own upwards of 160, 000 hoad of shoop and goats, 6000 head of oattle, and 10000 head of hor888, and 1000 head of burros, making an aggregateof 166,000 head of stook. This is a conservative estimate.Last year thedipping records for shoop and goats showed that 19 Indians owned more than1000 head each. There aro perhaps a dozen Navajos who are owners of herdsof from 50 to 250 head of cattle. The balance of the stook is fairly welldistributedamong the balance of the Indians. All olasses of stook are onthe inoroase, and the most progressive Indians are improving their different breeds.The outlookfor future increaseand improvementdependslargely upon the developmentof water and protectionof the range.Indians allotted in the Zuni National Forest within the boundariesofthe reservationare allowed to graze free within this reserve. I know ofno restrictionsplaced on these Indians except that they are cautionedagainst destroyingthe timber and requiredto assist in guarding againstforest fires.There are no Indians engaged in any industries other than the native.Nearly every family weaves blankets and rugs, for which they find a roadysale at prices ranging from 40 cents to$ 2.40 per pound, the value depending upon workmanship, design, and coloring.
