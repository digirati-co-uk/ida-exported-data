Annual ReportCarson Indian Agencyfind to ganble and especially on Saturday afterno ons anÄƒ Sundays it is very common to find crowdsof Indians assembled in the towns and cities ofthe State as well as at their own colonies andreservations engaged in gambling.The fact that there is no State lawagainst gambling makes it very difficult tocontrol among Indians.The remedy at present must be soughtby properly educating the Indian to see theharmful effects of gambling and to encourage himto take more interest in building his home andmaking it an attractive and desirable place tolive. This will take up so much of his timethat there will not be so much time left forgambling.The old fashioned Indian dance is notresorted to very much any more.One of the most serious conditions thatis met here is the unsatisfactory moral conditions.It is not uncommon for young Indian women to livewith Mexicans, Indian men, and others withoutproper marriage. This too must be a matter ofproper education, if we hope to better the conditions.At present, I fear that the sentiment for high moralconduct is not prevalent enough among the majorityof the Indians to act much as a deterrent forimmoral conduct.
