Well another year is gone, and the proud Class of 2007 couldn' t be
more excited and ready to see the real world. But what does that
mean for the Sophomore Class? Well surprisingly “ Soon- To- Be"
Juniors, our time to walk down the Paolo Soleri is coming quite fast,
and a lot sooner than we had expected. But, we still have to live out
our days here at SFIS. Just remember to take each day one step at
a time towards success, because like the Seniors told us, it all pays
off in the end. So to end this exciting year, here are some students
from the Sophomore Class that requested they make a last minute
shout to some of their friends before they begin their summer
vacation. Hang in there C/ O-' 09! Almost there!
