NARRATIVE SECTION.
LAN and ORDER.
EASTERN NAVAJO JURISDICTION.
Lissionaries of the Christian Reformed Church and the Seventh
Adventists are actively engaged in missionary work, and the first
mentioned operates a very fine hospital and boarding school near
Gallup with a very good patronage at the hospital.
The majority of the Indians of this jurisdiction live upon
the public domain. At times many work in lumbe, railroad and road
camps, and liquor is sold them by the white and Mexican bootlegger.
No peyote is made or used, nor tulapi or tiswin. one special officer
is stationed at Gallup, and there should be at least six men to
work in this extensive Indian country as one or two men cannot
begin to give close supervision with the expectation of being very
effective in prohibition enforcement.
Gambling is not indulged in as of former years. No legisla
tion has been enacted by the State Legislature within the past year
and no important decisions by the courts.
