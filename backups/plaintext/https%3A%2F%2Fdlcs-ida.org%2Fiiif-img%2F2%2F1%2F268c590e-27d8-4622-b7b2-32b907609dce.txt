Dear Sirs:
I am just in receipt of your bid for furnishing and delivere
ing lumber at this school, and in reply would inform you that as your
bid is on the entir. bill, it is impossible for me to determine on just
what articles your bid is the lowest, thorofor, it will be nocossary
for you to submit a bid showing the price por foot on each kind or
I umber etc., as the case may be delivered at the school- and by which
I may be able to make a compari son with all other bids rocoivod.
I would however inform you that your bid for shingles, flooring
and assorted cpress, poplar otc. will no doubt be as low as any I may
receive.
As I am in a great hurry for this lumber, I would thank you submit
a new bid covering the above points as soon as possibl., and upon re
ceipt of same I will wire you to send the materials upon which you
make the lowest bid.
Very respectfully,
Williet
Superintendent.
