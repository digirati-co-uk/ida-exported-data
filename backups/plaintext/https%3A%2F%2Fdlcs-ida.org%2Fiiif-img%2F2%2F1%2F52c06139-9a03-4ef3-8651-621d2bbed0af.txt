PROGRESS LEVEL B- 20ACCOUNT OF THE WORK DONE DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR 1933-34Progress Level B- 2 was comprised of thirty children between theages of seven and nine. Most of these children seemed to still retain individualistic rather than group characteristics. Theirconflicts were with other members of the class rather than with theteacher or the school.When individuals conflicted, the teacherusually asked for a decision of the group.This decision of thegroup was asually accepted as final.As a group these children did not have the characteristicshyness of most Navaho children, Although they had barely knowntheir teacher before, they were never bashiul.Alter talking no English during the summer, the childrenstill knew the names of practically all of the common articles inthe school room and about the plant. The most necessary verbs wereknown and used in the present tense only with few exceptions.–ê.few adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions were used. Pronounswere used, but they were greatly confused in gender. most of thechildren expressed themselves with a word or two rather thanattempting sentences.With these facts in mind, an activity program that would serveas a connecting link between school life and home life was adopted.The first aim of the whole program was to give the children thedesire and the ability to take their own situation and make thebest life possible from it.In order that they might accomplishthat purpose, the first emphasis was laid upon health, integratedwith good citizenship, knowledge of probable vocations, and culture.Learning English was most necessary to the accomplishment of thesepurposes.
