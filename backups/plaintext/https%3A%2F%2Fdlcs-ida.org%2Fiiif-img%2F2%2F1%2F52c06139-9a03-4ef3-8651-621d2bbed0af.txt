PROGRESS LEVEL B- 2

ACCOUNT OF THE WORK DONE DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR 1933-34
Progress Level B- 2 was comprised of thirty children between the
ages of seven and nine. Most of these children seemed to still re
tain individualistic rather than group characteristics. Their
conflicts were with other members of the class rather than with the
teacher or the school.
When individuals conflicted, the teacher
usually asked for a decision of the group.
This decision of the
group was asually accepted as final.
As a group these children did not have the characteristic
shyness of most Navaho children, Although they had barely known
their teacher before, they were never bashiul.
Alter talking no English during the summer, the children
still knew the names of practically all of the common articles in
the school room and about the plant. The most necessary verbs were
known and used in the present tense only with few exceptions.
–ê.
few adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions were used. Pronouns
were used, but they were greatly confused in gender. most of the
children expressed themselves with a word or two rather than
attempting sentences.
With these facts in mind, an activity program that would serve
as a connecting link between school life and home life was adopted.
The first aim of the whole program was to give the children the
desire and the ability to take their own situation and make the
best life possible from it.
In order that they might accomplish
that purpose, the first emphasis was laid upon health, integrated
with good citizenship, knowledge of probable vocations, and culture.
Learning English was most necessary to the accomplishment of these
purposes.
