The boys decided that our most important work was
to fix the skins, but since we had not received the skins,
spend
ve better our time plastering the outside wall to our Hogan,
Byrd remembered that when we plastered before we used two
parts sand to one of clay. We mde a list on the board or
the different jobs." Two boys were to screen the sand and
cly to take out the stones and lumps, Some boys were to
Carry the water. Others vero to mix the clay, some to carry
the clay, and the rest were to plaster.
Andy, Willie and Kilguy decided that they would 11ko
to work on the birdbath. They needed clay to plaster between
the rocks. They built a round wall first, then they filled
the inside with larger stoncs, when they were nenring the
top, they sloped it down from the sides. Andy said." We will
make it like a bowl.
We worked part of the morning outside, and then we
came inside, Sone of the boys picked up the pegs, and we
decided that perhaps wa could put some of them in the win
dow sills beneath the windows. se bored holes in the wood,
and glued phe pecs in the holes. I noticed that soon the
hats vero hanging on the pocs instond of el gevhere,
A few of the boys were in the hogan after the
11:30 whistle had blown. Leonard unconsciously spit on
the floor. I spoke about it, and we discussed the matter.
Andy sucgested that they should go a long ways from the
buildings. We will need to work on this more because they
do not seem to feel that they have done anything out of place,
as they do that way at home, I believe,
