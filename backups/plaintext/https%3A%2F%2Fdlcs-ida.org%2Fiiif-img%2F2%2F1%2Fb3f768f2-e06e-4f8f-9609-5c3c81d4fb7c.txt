Ann
Report, 1931.
EASTERN MAVAJO JURISDICTION.
SPECIAL
In the early 80's much trouble was experienced
by our Goverment and the settlers of Arizona and
New Mexdoo with Geronimo and his murderous band of
Apaches, and the United States Goverment had much
difficulty in stopping the warfare and raids perpe
trated by this band. They enlisted many Nava jos as
Indian Soouts; more than 200 Indians rendered service
during this campaign.
Their services were pensionable under regulations
providing pension for scouts and soldiers in Indian
Wars, and at this time nearly 100 scouts or their
widows are receiving such benefits and the sum which
they now receive amounts to$ 3,000 per month and these
old timers are very grateful for the assistance that
has been given them, which is their reward for their
loyalty to the United States Government during the
pioneer days of New Mexico and Arizona.
The widows all receive$ 30.00 per month and the
scouts receive from$ 20.00 to$ 50.00; only a few of
the younger ones receive$ 20.00 at this time. A
number of scouts also are included in this pension
roll who rendered service up to as late as 1891.
