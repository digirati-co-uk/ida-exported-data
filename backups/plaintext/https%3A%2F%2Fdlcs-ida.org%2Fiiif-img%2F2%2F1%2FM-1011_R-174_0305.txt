|7There has not been the same results accomplishedduring the year that had formerly been accomplished.The good physician, Dr. Edward J. Davis, who had spentmany of the best years of his life with the Zunis leftthe Indian Service. He was succeeded by a stranger whohad not the same interest in these people. He stayed buta short time when he also resiged. The physician we nowhave has been with us since last fall. He is new in thework. He is peculiar, distant and ab sent- minded. He doesnot understand the Indians and they do not understand him.He seems to have a good knowledge of medicine but cannever secure the confidence of the Indians.The most urgent need for carrying of the medicalor health work on the reservation is a successful physicianwho is energetic and has the welfare of the work at heart.The first and most essential thi ng necessary to do inorder to get and hold such a man is to provide suitablequarters for himself and his family.( a).The position of Agency nurse should be filled,Then another position of field matron should becreated, the duties of whom should be work amoungthe outlying villages on the reservation.The work of the field matron has been principallydirected to health conditions and sanitation in the Indianhome s, the care and feeding of babies and teaching Indianwomen better ways of cooking and making of clothing.- 10
