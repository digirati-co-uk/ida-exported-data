( 3)The Southern Pueblog Indian Agency also observes and partiallycontrols about 360 Navajo Indians, located on the public doma in, inCanonc ito( north of Laguna Pueblo) and Puertodito( west of Magdalena)districts.Prior to September 1, 1919, all of the seventeen Pueblos properwere grouped under one Agent at the present Southern Pueblos headquarters;but on that date a division of the jurisdictionwas madeand the seven Pueblos north of Santa Fe were placed under a separateAgency. The original Agency retained the ten larger Pueblo ar elsand about seven- tenths of the general business and population.The Agency headquarters are in Albuquerque, but the ten Pueblosextend over three counties of central New Mexico, Sandoval, Bernlilloand Valencia.The Jemez and Sia pueblos are fifty mil es north ofAlbuquerque, and Cochiti and Santo Domingo fifty miles east( thefirst three removed from railroad); while old Acoma pueblo andmost western Acoma settlements( McCarty's and vicinity) are ninetymiles west of Albuquerque.The other pueblog are located betweenthese points, seven of them being on the Santa Fe railroad system,stretching from Domingo station westward a distance of 135 miles.Therefore to go from one end of the jurisdictionto the other, byany route, presents 100 to 135 miles travel, and as railroadschedules are not accommodative, nearly all prompt business must bedone by automobile. From railroad stations the field work must bearranged by auto or team.
