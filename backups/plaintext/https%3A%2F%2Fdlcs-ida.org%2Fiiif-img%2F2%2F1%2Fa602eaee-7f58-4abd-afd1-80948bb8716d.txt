C.RLOMVADSEPurtSir:The Narrative report for 1816 has been sent in. It was lateand this could not be helped, as the Superintendent could not possibly find the time to write it up sooner.Particular attention is called to that part of the reportwhich recommends the building of a large school here at Leupp.By raising the central building one story and constructinga Dining Hall& Kitchen, in addition to the School Building&Assembly Hall that must be built anyway, the capacity could be easily300 to 350.With the new course of study requiring pre- vocational andvocational training, small schools are no longer practicable, andthey have always been excessively expensive.This location is supplied with abundant water, is near the mainline of the Santa Fe Ry., is south and near the center of a largepopulation of Navajos, is 4600 ft. elevation with a splendid climatesuited to the native Indians, would be a splendid location for aHospital too, has an extensive and excellent range, and is the veryplace for an Industrial and Stock school.From here as a center the Navajo sheep could be sensibly,practicably, and successfully bred up. And here the Indian boys couldbe taught trades.GereeHctfully,DonAWDSuperintendent.
