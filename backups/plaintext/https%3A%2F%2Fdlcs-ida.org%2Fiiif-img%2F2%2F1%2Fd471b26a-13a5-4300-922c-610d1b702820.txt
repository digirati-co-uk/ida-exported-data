The Meadow LarkBy PAXTON BOONE( Zuni)Once there was a bird whose feathers were all yellow, but it so happenedthat he had the habit of sitting by his nest and singing real early in the morning. The people who lived near by did not like to be awakened too early inthe morning by the singing of this bird so they decided to drown him.One night the man went to the bird' s nest and poured water on him whilehe was asleep. The water which had been prepared for this purpose, wasmixed with ashes, which turned the feathers gray. The water was poured onthe bird' s back and by luck the bird bent his head so that it covered his breastpreventing the water from getting there. That is why the meadow lark has agray back and a yellow breast.The Black CrowBy JOE A. MONTOYA( Taos)The black crow which we see flying around every day is said to have beena pretty bird at one time before he did a foolish thing. He was consideredthe best hunter of all birds.It happened that once an owl came to the crow and begged for somefood. The foolish crow, seeing the owl without hunting weapons, loaned hisbow and arrow to the owl.The owl flew away to hunt for his food and never returned. The crowwaited and waited, but the owl still didn' t return. The crow having to hunthis own food had to go out under the hot sun so long that his beautiful whitefeathers burned to an ugly black.It was said that the crow would have looked like the owl if he had notlent his bow and arrow to the owl.SZNZNZ:
