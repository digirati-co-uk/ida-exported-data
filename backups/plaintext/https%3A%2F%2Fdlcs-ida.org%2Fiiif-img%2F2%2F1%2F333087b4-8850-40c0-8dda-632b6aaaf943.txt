ing$ 63.50 in the open market purchase of materials and the employ
men of labor as follows;
$ 12.50
2500 brick, at not to excees$ 5.00 per lo

2000 pounis of lime, at not to exceed 50 € per cwt.
16.00
4 days mason work, at not to exceed$ 4.00 per ney-------
IO days carpenter work, at not to exceаd$ 3.00 per day
30.00
$ 63.50
The above is greatly needed for laying foundation and constructing
double porches in front and rear of employes buildingo
At present there is but a small uncovered porch in front of the
building and it is worn out and should be removed.
I have on hand sufficient lumber for the construction of the
porches, and it could not be used for a better purpose, as they would
not only add greatly to the appearance of the building, but would be
a great convenience, as well as a rire escape from the building, which
1s nocessary as there 13 but one stairway in the building,
Very respectfully,
Thonesus
Supt.& Spelle Dioba. Aga te
