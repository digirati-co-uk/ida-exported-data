I to UNRECEIVED.JUL 21 1910An Indian boy or girl who completes the work in our schoolsshould at least be able to add accurately a column of figures,speak intelligently and grammatically, and to write a legible,correctly- spelled, and properly- formed letter; not that educationconsists merely in the doing of these things, but in this practical business world a man' s education is too often judged bythese standards. In our introduction of this and that branchof so- called higher education, and even in the inclusion ofindustrial branches, care should be taken that when a boy orgirl leaves an Indian school supported by the federal governmentthat he or she should have a thorough grounding and preparationin these things,Teachers and officials in the Indian Service,and others who are in a position to know, who have read lettersprepared by some of the graduates of our schools and have witnessedtheir lack of knowledge of many of the common affairs of theircountry and of everyday life, will agree that this whole subjectis of too much vital consequence to be slipped by.
