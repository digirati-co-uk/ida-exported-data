Navajo country, stating that this affair should be left largely
to the local superintendents in their discretion, the complete
conservation of all foodstuffs remained largely in the usual
channels. On the Moqui Reservation, however, livestock sales
were discouraged and restricted solely to the resident licensed
traders, where all sales could be supervised; so that the
Indian holdings were not depleted to the benefit of outside
stock specula tors.
In closing this section, as super intendent I think
it only just and fair to state that, while in the past the
Hopi Indian has evidenced himself as a peculiar, refractory
and reactionary person generally, the War enabled a manifestation
of his better qualities, and he should be given great credit.
It may be that in recent years he has observed more of prompt
square dealing, and has appreciated it. He is not unmindful
of reservation changes, largely for the benefit of his children,
the increase of water, stock, and intelligent guidance along
feasible paths to prosperity, as opposed to do- nothing- ism
coupled with abortive efforts to force his interest in matters
such as agriculture according to white men's Kansas methods.
Moreover, he has found that friendly or hostile, Christian or
Snake- dancer, he has been given a fair deal. There has been
no effort to make either a white man or a Chris tian of him.
With these two old and bloodshed ing efforts shelved, he has
responded to the plan of considering him humanly as an Indian.
