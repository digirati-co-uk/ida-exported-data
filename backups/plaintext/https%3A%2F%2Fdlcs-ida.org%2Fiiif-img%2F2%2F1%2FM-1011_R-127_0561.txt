Annual Report.Field- Irrigation- 5.Santa Fe Schooland Agency.from time to time in the pueblos, such as the installationof the pumping plant at San Ildefonso.Should the plan suggested in the above recommendation seen impracticable or inexpodient, I would respectfullyrecommend that the Superintendent of Irrigation be instructedto consult with this office on all work to be done in thisdistrict, in order that the superintendent may have a fulland complete knowledge of such work, I believe that theIrrigation Service should cooperate to the fullest possibleextent with the superintendent in the conduct of irrigationwork in this districtThe water situation at Sia is bad. The surfaceflow of the Jemez River, except in the arly spring in floodseasons, is very small, and such surface low, as there isis taken up by the Jemez Indians and Moxican settlers abovethe Sia pueblo to such an extent, that during the summermonths there is practically no water for irrigation purposes left in the river for the Sia Indians, I believe thereis a sufficient underflow in the Jemez River bed at Sia toprovide water for enough land to insure then sufficient crops,at least, for their own consumption. My judgement is thata pumping plant, similar to that which is being installedat San Ildefonso, should be placed at Sia at a feasiblepoint in the Jemez River bed on the opposita side of theriver from the village, There is a sufficient acreage onthis side of the river to support the Sia pueblo, 1f waterwere provided. It will, of course, be necessary to sinktest wells in the river bed to determine whether a pumpingplant is feasible. This should be done at an early date.The Sia Indians are in straightened circumstances,owing to scarcity of water. For the past few years theircrops have been very light on this account. I see no reaedyfor the present lack of water except through a pumping plant,which, if feasible, could be installed at small expense, asI am confidont the Indians would be willing to contribute thelabor necessary in the digging of the wells and constructionof the ditches,
