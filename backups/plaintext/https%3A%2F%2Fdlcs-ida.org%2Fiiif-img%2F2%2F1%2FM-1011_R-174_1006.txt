16. Tmo zuns Indsans do not use pozote or monoa:
11. Sonme liquor is brought in by Nava jos and Mexicans but the
greater amount is brought here by the Zuni Indians.
12. Liquor can be procured in unlimited quantities both at Gal
lup and at points adjacent to the reservation in almost any
direction.
13. McKinley County authorities handle cases when we take them
to them but they do this reluctantly as the claim is made that
the Indians are not tax payers and that we should handle our
own cases and punish the ones who violate the law.
14. The superintendent, farmer and stockman are now deputy spe
cial officers and this carries sufficient authority for handl
ing such cases where the need arises.
15. The Zunis have no Indian drink such as tulapai or tiswin
but they can secure all the bootleg hooch they desire. They
do not make intoxicants here as the supply is unlimited and
there is no need for them to do this.
16. The Zuni Indians do not use peyote or mescal.
17. They do not use extracts or proprietary medicines as they
can secure all the intoxicants they desire.
18. All the legislation that is needed is some law whereby there
is some enforcement machinery upon the reservation.
19. This has been answered under a previous heading.
20. There is no doubt that national prohibition has been help
ful but we have not been very successful in stopping the usa
of intoxicants among the Indians.
21. No drugs are used by the Indians here.
22. The Indians do not manufacture intoxicants.
23. This has been helpful as without it no doubt we would have
considerably more liquor introduced than is now the case.
24. Very 11ttle gambling is practiced here.
