Those children who did not care to play, developed aboutthe same traits and knowledge through painting and drawing. Theevaluation of these pictures developed some skill in art.Stresswas given to those pictures which told a story, had good colorcombinations, and were balanced on the page.By the close of September, the class had completed severalbuildings, had made a few excursions to study the plan an occupations in Crown Point, and were beginning& road for their carsand trucks. It was decided that a picture that a pictorial mapof the campus would heop develop the unit and give the childrensome training in the use of maps.The first drawings on this mapwere done as group activities and the directions and names ofbuildings were learned. The last part of the map was drawn byindividuals and eas even more successful than the first part.One of the older children was the first to introduce theruler.Early in October, Fred Padilla used a ruler in measuringfor size of a roof for one of the dormitories.Tom, another of thelarger boys, was able to read" 21 inches" as the size of theboard needed for the roof Fred was building. This led to drillon using and reading the ruler and later, the yard stick.Discussions and evaluations of paintings anddrawings werevery good as in aid in language development. Early in October,when some of the children asked to see and discuss paintingsthey had made, the children were interested enough to be lessself- conscious and freer in expressing their views.
