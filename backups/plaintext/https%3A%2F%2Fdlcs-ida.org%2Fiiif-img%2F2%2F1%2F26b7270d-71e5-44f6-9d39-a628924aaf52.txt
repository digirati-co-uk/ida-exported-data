Those children who did not care to play, developed about
the same traits and knowledge through painting and drawing. The
evaluation of these pictures developed some skill in art.
Stress
was given to those pictures which told a story, had good color
combinations, and were balanced on the page.
By the close of September, the class had completed several
buildings, had made a few excursions to study the plan an occupa
tions in Crown Point, and were beginning& road for their cars
and trucks. It was decided that a picture that a pictorial map
of the campus would heop develop the unit and give the children
some training in the use of maps.
The first drawings on this map
were done as group activities and the directions and names of
buildings were learned. The last part of the map was drawn by
individuals and eas even more successful than the first part.
One of the older children was the first to introduce the
ruler.
Early in October, Fred Padilla used a ruler in measuring
for size of a roof for one of the dormitories.
Tom, another of the
larger boys, was able to read" 21 inches" as the size of the
board needed for the roof Fred was building. This led to drill
on using and reading the ruler and later, the yard stick.
Discussions and evaluations of paintings anddrawings were
very good as in aid in language development. Early in October,
when some of the children asked to see and discuss paintings
they had made, the children were interested enough to be less
self- conscious and freer in expressing their views.
