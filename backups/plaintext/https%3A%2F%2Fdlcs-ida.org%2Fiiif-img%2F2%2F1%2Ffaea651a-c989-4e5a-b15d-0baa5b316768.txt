San Juan
School
and Agency
While
the Shorthorn
cattle
are not as desirable
for beef
stock on the range
as the Hereford
, many head from the school
herd have been purchased
by the Indians
and have done fairly
well
on the reservation
.
The Shorthom
do not have sufficient
rustling
qualities
to come through
the winters
and years of short
feed in good condition
.
The high prices
which wool and sheep have commanded
the
past four years have occasioned
a decrease
in blanket
weaving
,
While
anything
like present
high prices
prevail
, very little
blanket
weaving
will be done. Nothing
should
be done that would
in any way discourage
blanket
weaving, for with a return to a
lower level of prices
, this art would again become
a valuable
asset to the tribo.
There
are not enough
returned
students
at present
on this
reservation
for a comparison
of their industrial
accomplishments
with that of other
Indians
who have not had the advantages
of
education.
There
has been no systematic
organization
for the work
of the farmers
on the reservation
possible
or practicable
under
present conditions
,
There is one permanent
farmers
' station
on the reservation
at Aneth, Utah. Two other stations
were partially
completed
during
the year.
