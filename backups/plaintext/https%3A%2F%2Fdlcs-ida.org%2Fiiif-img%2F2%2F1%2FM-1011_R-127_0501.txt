Annual ReportIndustries- 4Santa Fetimber and fuel purposes, I submitted, last March, recommenda.tions that certain tracts of the public domain and NationalForest Reserves be set aside for the several pueblos for thesepurposesThe$ 2, 000 from the Re imbursable fund, in the Act of March3, 191l, tentatively apportioned to this jurisdiction, and anadditioral one thousand dollars of the amount requested,wastaken up through application of the Indians.

This natter has been taken up in detail, and Iam informed by the Office that if the amount recommended in theappropriation bill is passed,re- surveys will be made during the
