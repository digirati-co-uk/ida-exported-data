OPUTABLO FATW CONDITIONS.1- Tuberculosis.Doubtless the most menacing desease of the Indianas well as that of all races 11 the" great white plaguer.Ido not know that this disease is rapidly increasing in thisdistrict but since becoming better acquainted with them it hasbecome possible to locate more cases.since assuming chargehere twenty- seven Laguna Indians have died of tuberculosis andprobably a proportionate number of the Acomas. Jy conclusions,from experience with them 18 that they can not be treatedaccording to any general rules but to furnish protection toothers each case must have the individual attention it requires and this has not been possible since the physician hasbeen compelled to cover so much ground.I do not like to beguilty of doing sloppy work but must confess that in some cases1t predominated from the fact that the physician did not havethe ability or time to give all cases the attention they shouldhave had,I have tried to arouse the Indian to his full sense orduty in the eradication or tuberculosis and have missed noopportunity to tell him he must not spit on the floor or inpublic places, that he must ventilate his home, keep them cleanand observe rational laws of personal family and communalhygiene and sanitation,They still spit on the floor, sleep intheir clothes, bathe too infrequent, keep the rooms too sturty
