Before reaching this great life of prosperity I hadone more great height to surmount and that was the highest peak of all themountains. I climbed and climbed until I reached the top. From these greatheights I could see and hear everything that was going on in all parts of theworld.As I stood gazing from the peak, I saw, almost directly below me, the cityof Los Angeles where Arthur Smith, Frank Pedro, and Isaac Schongva wereteaching electrical engineering at the Los Angeles Trade School. Ivy Bavansie,Bernice Johns, Katalina Sando, Bessie Sandoval, and Imogene Chosemona hadall become famous actresses in Hollywood. In Riverside, California, I saw Raymond Beardsley superintendent in charge of Sherman Institute and CarlotaValencia was his secretary. Here I also saw Alberta Jojola, Daisy Enos, GeorgiaJohnson, and Elizabeth Saracino teaching home ecenomics. I saw TheresaPeshlakai, as head of the Indian Arts and Crafts Dept. at the Chemawa Indianschool in Oregon. Paul Yestewa, Fred Betselie, and Peter Riley were teachingpainting and interior decorating at the Phoenix Indian School in Arizona. MaxHanley and Eugene Gokey had taken over the A- Loaf Baking Company andwere the leading bakers in the city of Albuquerque. At dear old A. I. S. Joe M.Ortiz had succeeded Supt. Perry and Etta Weyer was at Mrs. Harrin n' s deskat the school building. Ben Sanchez had become famous as an inventor. AtAcoma, he was installing one of his largest elevators. Clarence Eunie and BertPoleahla had gone into stock raising on a large scale and had the world' s largest cattle ranch in the Black Mountain country. David and Jake Peshlakai, andAugustine Kee, noted contractors of the West were building a large Indian hospital at Chin Lee. In Denver, Colorado, Emil Poolehuyouma was in charge ofthe chemical department for the Sherwin Williams Paint Co. Agnes Shattuckwas a member of the faculty of the University of Colorado. At Haskell Institute, Lawrence, Kansas, I saw Ethelyn Mitchell and Luther Pahe in the musicdepartment; Isadore Duran, Porfirio Garcia, and Manley Barton were shop instructors there. As I looked further East, I saw, in the city of Chicago, RobertHistia, as president; Robert Martin, vice president; John Marianito, Secretaryof the Chicago Automotive Company, where Solomon Day, Levi Morberto, Albert Hickson, and Kent Teller were employed. Richard Corillo and Frank Mondragon owned the largest airport in Chicago, and Guy Hubbard and GeorgeDaga were two of their skilled pilots. Eleanor Sawtrom, Marian Archuleta, andJulia Romero were in Miami Beach, Florida, for a beauty contest. ErnestPoncho was at Washington, D. C., as the Secretary of the Interior. BartolaAbeita and Clarence Warner were coaching football at Notre Dame. At WestPoint were Gen. Clarence Wesley, Maj. Henry Kee Joe, and Captains HubertKelewood and Wilson Tso. Iola Nez, Ella Tsosie, Sadie Becente, and LeonaKlenesbah were on the teaching staff of the New York Correspondence School.Jennie Paisano, Terecita Jiron, Virginia Duran and Dorathy Bowman hadbroken into the lime light on the stage in New York City. My last glance wasacross the Atlantic Ocean and the first city I saw was London. Here I foundanjo, who was now famous in dramatic arts. Great artists from allover the world came to her for training. Some of her own classmates of A. I. S.were among the greatest artists. Those training under her at that time were Edden Ration, Valgean Y., Rebecca Horace, Lena Tabee, Juanita Smith, PaulineCadman, Amy Benally, Mercedes Ashley, Pauline Seyanim, Woodrow Nez, Dorathy Jenkins, and Zella Herman.This concludes my prophecy and I am very well satisfied that all of myclassmates have taken the same road I am taking.nananananananananannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnanananananananananEnnennananananananananananana LCLLLLLLLLLLLSLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLSLLLLLSLLLLLLLLLLLLLSLLLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLÇLIhinnangrahanubhaananTail.LCUCUCUCUCUELOCLCLCLCIrinnenCUCLCLCLCUCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCUCUחלחכותבתכתבותכותבתכתבותכותבותכותבותלחלחלחכותבותכתבתבותכותבותכותנהVELELELELESEID==
