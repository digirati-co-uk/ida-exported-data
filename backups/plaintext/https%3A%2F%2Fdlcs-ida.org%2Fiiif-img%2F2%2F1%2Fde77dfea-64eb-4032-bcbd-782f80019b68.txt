Section IV--Industries( Cont'a)( b) The State College at Las Cruces is helpfulin the organization of these clubs, especially at Taos.18. I have no suggestion as to new crops or enterprisethat might be introduced in any of the pueblos.19.Have no suggestion as to facilities for trade amongIndians.( a) The dealings with Indiane, so far as Iam able to determine, are fair.20.We have no sawmills at this agency.21. The Santa Clara Executive Order Reservation containsone of the most extensive and interesting c1111 dwellingsknown in the Southwest. The Executive Order Reservationthat was created about 1905 was meant to include the Puyeclifts, which had been visited only occasionally byvisitors for the past twenty odd years. The Fred Harveypeople came into Santa Fe, purchased the largest hotelin the city and have inaugurated a system of detours tothe pueblos including Puye. The state of New Mexico,with some small assistance, has built a fairly good roadfrom Espanola to the Puye clifts, there being a very goodhighway from Santa Te to Espanola. Busses now run dailyfrom Santa Fe to Espanola and to Puye where the Harveypeople have built a resthouse: they have been given acontract for a small piece of land near the cliffs.The matter of the jurisdiction of the Governmentrepresenting the Indians is in question at the presentwiting. During the month of April 100 automobiles andbusses visited the clifts. No tee at present is beingoharged: a mamber of the Indians are very much opposedto the Harvey people ina smuch as they pay no fee, only$ 10.00 rental for perhaps three- quarters of an acre ofland,Under the direction of the Sohool of AmericanResearoh in this city, excavations are being carried onannually: none have started yet this spring, althoughan archaeologist has been sent up to the clirts and hehas been waiting there for his permit to arrive.Acertain faction of the Indians are complaining becausethey object to the desecration of the cliffs of theirancestors, the bones being dug up and carried away,destroyed or sent to other museums. They also objectto the Government allowing visitors to enter the cliffsas tourists and paying no fee,
