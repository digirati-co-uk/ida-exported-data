SCHOOLS
The Carson Boarding school is located on the
Virginia& Truckee Railway a bout 3 miles from the town
of Carson.
The average attendance for the school year closing
in June was 449 with a total enrollment of 491 pupils.
The School is now classified as a Junior High School,
operating on the non- departemental plan. There are six
elementary grades and three junior high school grades with one
non- classified, or adult. primary class. In four of the class
roors-- kindergarten, first grade, second grade and third grade--
they attend school all of each school day, devoting an hour
each afternoon to some form of industrial work or rechanical
ranipulations as bead work, basketry, clay modeling, etc. This
work then is corrulated with English and building up vocabularies.
. A certain amount of industrial training is given during
the year but as in many other boarding schools, this industrial
work is not given with the regularity and effectiveness it
should be. It is hoped that better results may be obtained
during the corning school year under the new Platoon System of
organization.
During the vacation period rany of the older girls
and boys are wage earners-- most of the girls work in CÄ…lifornia.
under the supervision of Mrs. Bonnie V. Royce, outing patron
at Berkeley; rany of the boys work in the hay fields, sheep
carps and on the ranches of Nevada and eastern California.
