Section II, oontira.â€¢ Healthbetter equipped.A great many of the pupils are in need of dental work. Dur.ing the past yeat no effort was made toward procuring a Government dentist. The children were expected to pay from theirmeager funds for all dental work done. Some arrangements shouldbe made for the coming year since good teeth are essential togood health.AThe building used as a hospital is but a poor make shiftand instead of being the hut from which the health of the schoolradiates, it is actually a detriment to the school and an eyesore to all visitors. This frame building was never intended fora hospital and while it may have served as such advantageouslywhen the school had a small enrollment, it is entirely inadequateat the present time for an enrollment of 800 pupils. Furthermore a hospital should be furnished and equipped not only for careof the sick, for necessary operations, but with space for isolations purposes in case of contagious diseases and some space tobe devoted to classroom instruction in nursing.
