better equipped.
A great many of the pupils are in need of dental work. Dur.
ing the past yeat no effort was made toward procuring a Govern
ment dentist. The children were expected to pay from their
meager funds for all dental work done. Some arrangements should
be made for the coming year since good teeth are essential to
good health.

The building used as a hospital is but a poor make shift
and instead of being the hut from which the health of the school
radiates, it is actually a detriment to the school and an eye
sore to all visitors. This frame building was never intended for
a hospital and while it may have served as such advantageously
when the school had a small enrollment, it is entirely inadequate
at the present time for an enrollment of 800 pupils. Further
more a hospital should be furnished and equipped not only for care
of the sick, for necessary operations, but with space for isola
tions purposes in case of contagious diseases and some space to
be devoted to classroom instruction in nursing.
