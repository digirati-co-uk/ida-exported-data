WOW! I can' t believe that high school is over; it' s kind of hard to
believe that we made it through all four years. I wouldn' t have been
able to make it without the support and push of my friends and family
you know who you are. I will miss you guys so much and I wish all of
vou the very best of luck as we enter the next journey and chapter of
our lives. For all the rest of my fellow students, especially Ramon and
DeVaughn work hard and it will all pay off. To everyone else keep
your heads up and you' re almost finished. Good luck all seniors, I hope
you have fun in college!!
