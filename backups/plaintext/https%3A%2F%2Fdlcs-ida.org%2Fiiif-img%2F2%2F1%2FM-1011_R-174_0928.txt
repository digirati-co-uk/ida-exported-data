Dear Sir:
With regard to the collect telegram
of August 23, calling attention to the
fact that letters of July 23 and 24 rela
tive to cost or hospital had not been an
S wered, the Office is advised that we are
very sorry that tnis occurred. The reas-
on for this oversight is the fact that the
chief clerk was on vacation and the matter
of calling his attention to these correc
tions was overlooked on his return.
Very truly yours,
Gad
