8..NARRATIVESection IV., Con.d.Industries,Annual Report, 1911.Pueblo Day Schools at Santa Fe, NM,Othis remediod, so that in case of trespass by cattle, damagescan be obtainod under the laws of Now Mexico, The agriculturalimplom ots in uso are not up to date, but the Indians manageto get along with them fairly well.In nearly all the Puoblosthe womon mako pottory, and quite a revenue is derived fromthis sourco.A fow of the Pueblo Indians go out in thesurrounding country and do such work as they can obtain, butthe main source of livelihood is the cultivation of the soil,raising sheep and goats.There are no licensed traders and there are noSaw Mills,on the Santa Clara Reservation there are the remains of cliff dwellings, and excavations are being madeunder direction of Archaeologists.No agricultural fairs are held but each Pueblo hasits fiesta day which is numerously attended by the people ofthe surrounding country. All that I have attended so far,( six in mumber) have been well conducted, however there hasbeen some drinking and gambling at most of them, which waspromptly dealt with, the offenders in most cases being visitingMexicans.About the only good I see in these fiesta days isthat the Indians make a clean up of their houses, so that atleast for a few days in the year improved sanitary conditionsprevail.
