NZXZNZNZNZNZNZNClass PoemBy MANUELITA GARCIADear A. I. S., now that the timeOf parting draws so near,We must express our thanks to you,The school we held so dear.There are so many things we' ll missWhen we have left your halls,And many times we' ll wish to beOnce more within your walls.Our classroom work, the band' s gay times,The programs, dances, even drills,And best of all, friends old and trueWe' ll think oft at memory' s will.And in the future, we will tryTo live up to the best for youAnd wish that you may some day be proudOf all that our class hopes to do.
