Dear Sir:
Relative to notation attached to
Recapitulation Census sheets of Statisti
ca repor,
you are advised that no error
in our totals can be found. Is the con
fusignapossibly caused by the fact that
deatnother subtractions made from the
census total left the number smallerthan
is thought correct? I realize that the
total of the census is 2, 000 but thought
it necessary to eliminate from the number
those who will not appear on the 1930 copy
of the census
Very truly yours,
A Gain/
