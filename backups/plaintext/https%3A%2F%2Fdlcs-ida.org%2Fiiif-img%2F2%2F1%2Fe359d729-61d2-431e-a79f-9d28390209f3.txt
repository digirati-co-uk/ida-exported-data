Owing to the" flu" situation during the fall and
winter seasons the enrollment was smaller than usual,
also, the cost of supplies was so high as to make
it advisable not to enroll as many as in former years.
One of the difficulties in the education of the
Indians of the Southwest is to be able to leep them
in school until they complete the entire course of
study. It is impossible to do this in all cases
where the pupils should remain in school but we have
been endeavorins to hold pupils until they finish
the course where it is believed that advanced educa
tion will be beneficial. When the tentative course
of study was adopted in 1916, 247 pupils in this
school were in and below the third grade. At the
close of school in June, not considering the graduat
ing class of ten and the girls who were attending
High School, the pupils have been placed in crades
as follows for the ensuing year, viz.;
