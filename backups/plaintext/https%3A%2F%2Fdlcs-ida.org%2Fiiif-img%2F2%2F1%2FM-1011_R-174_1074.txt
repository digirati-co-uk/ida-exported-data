There have not been funds available for theproper upkeep of the graded roads and they are now insuch a condition as to be practically impassable duringthe rainy season and are in iact often entirely inpassable during much of the winter and spring.There are two new roads which should be built atan early date. The first and most important is tneconstruction of a new road from the Zuni villagewest to the Arizona State Line. This road wouldconnect with the Arizona State Highway into St. Johns,Arizona. This route has been designated by the NewMexico State Highway Commission as a state highway butthe present indications are that the state of NewMexico will not construct this road for several years.
