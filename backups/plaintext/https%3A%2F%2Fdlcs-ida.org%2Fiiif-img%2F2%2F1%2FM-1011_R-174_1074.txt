the location of existing roads or other improvements
in use on the reservation. There are no government
built trails and practically all travel is by
automobile.
New Construction
The only construction work carried on during the
year was the building of eigat miles of new graded
road on the Zuni- ojo Caliente road. The separate
cost figures of this construction work are not
available so there is no table of cost of construction
submitted.
Proposed Construction
The roads on the Zuni Reservation are badly in
need of being regraded and several new bridges con
structed. There have not been funds available for the
proper upkeep of the graded roads and they are now in
such a condition as to be practically impassable during
the rainy season and are in iact often entirely in
passable during much of the winter and spring.
There are two new roads which should be built at
an early date. The first and most important is tne
construction of a new road from the Zuni village
west to the Arizona State Line. This road would
connect with the Arizona State Highway into St. Johns,
Arizona. This route has been designated by the New
Mexico State Highway Commission as a state highway but
the present indications are that the state of New
Mexico will not construct this road for several years.
