not extend beyong Second Year Vocational That is we offer
as far as the equivalent
of the Grade VIII of the common
schools
.
The needs of the school have been pretty fully set
forth in my reply, dated June 27, 1921, to Indian office
Circular No. 1681 To make any further comment on this sub
ject would be to merely repeat what I wrote in this connection
in my annual report of a year ago The conditions
detailed
there have not improved and we need at this ime exactly what
we needed then I may add that we need those things more now
than a year ago
We have no real graduates at this school I have
already stated that the highest grade offered here is second
Year vocational
so few pupils continue beyond that point
that it is more in the interest of economy to transfer them
to some other school having large classes in 3rd and 4th yrs
vocational
Our school facilities

change or radical departure
from what has hitherto obtained
adapted to get needs," he naian Guho FH. Er SES SOIS"
available and obtainable
However as I stated a year ago
the Harrington
books for Non- English speaking people, the
Grade Classics readers
all the Riverside readers
everything
bearing the name of Wooster
all the Frye Geographies
and
the Davison Physiologies
could be dropped off the authorized
list without any loss to the Indian Service
As regards loyalty and efficiency upon the part of
employees
attention is respectfully
invited to my report of
May 1, 1921 on Character and Efficiency
of Employees
In so
far as loyalty to our Goverment and Country is concerned, I
think every one has fulfilled all the requirements
As regards
efficiency, there have been a few cases which left a good deal
to be desired. The worst was the case of Louis Rulo ant otoe
Indian
our assistant disciplinarian
who went to pieces morally
a few months ago and is now in jail awaiting trial on a charge of
forgery
e try to make and I believe we are making, the work
at this school something specially adapted to meet the most ur.
gent needs of the Indians
What the girls most need to know
is something of up- to- date methods in cooking, housework, home
care of the sick, and sanitation
or general preventive
measures
with regard to sickness
Our pupils al1pcome from plant- produding
