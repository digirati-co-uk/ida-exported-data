San Francisco, Cal,
Referring to your letter G 44" or August 2 and to my telegran
of today through H. S. Lutz, agent A, T, SF R. R. of this city, I will
say.
My agent, Mr. W.T. Sheltons now in southern Arizonia in the
interests of this school,
I have out little faith in his getting the
requiruito children at Casa Grande out he will work also in and ar
ound Tuscon and San Carlos Agency.
I would be glad if you would direct
your agents at all three points to sell nr. Shelton tickets as agreed
In case he does not get the required ten at Casa Grande he will
out tickets at local rates to muscon and at that place probably his
winny
party will be large enough to demand the two thirds rata,
He will
Probably not get ton at San Carlos Dulhe Wall without doubt far excer
the ten by the time he leaves Tuscon,
My agent on Puget Sound will hardly get the fan so will be com
polled to come regualr,
y telegrar
cover's
the Elko matter
