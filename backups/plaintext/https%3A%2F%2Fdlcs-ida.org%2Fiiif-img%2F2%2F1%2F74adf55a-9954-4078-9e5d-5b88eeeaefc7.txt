The Hon. Commissioner
of Indian Affairs,
Washington, De
I have the honor to request that I be authorized to pur
chage two good work horses, weighing not less than 1000 pounds
each, at$ 100.00 each
$ 200,00 for the two
I have no Stock Cattle funds in hand, but have made requi
sition for the necessary amount for the first quarter 1893.
The reason I request authority to purchase two more horses
is that the school has but three now and it 18 desired to commence
the industry of brick- making this season, which will require
another team.
Very respectfully
,
Superintendent.
