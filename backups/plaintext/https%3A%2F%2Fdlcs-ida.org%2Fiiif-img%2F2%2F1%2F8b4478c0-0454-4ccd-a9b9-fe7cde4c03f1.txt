OrchestraofVocalPipes!Eleven Tibetan monks visited our school this year,and many thoughts were exchanged while peace wasoffered.All the monks joined the priesthood at a young ageand expressed they wouldn' t trade their life for anything. Their prayers and methods of meditation wereexhibited to the student body. It sounded like anorchestraof vocal pipes.The monks believe there are evil spirits all aroundand that their method of prayer will drive these spirits away. The prayers are a very important part oftheir day and activities. Before each meal they meditate.The monks may have given up worldly possessionsfor their holiness, but are also known for watchingT. V. as often as possible( especially cartoons!) Theylove making new friends, and praying for peace.As the monks left, we realized that different cultures could meet, share an important part of theirlives and depart as friends!â€” Mike LopezDena with His Holiness, the Dali LamaANSCHTwo monks showing schoolspirit.Mike enjoying lunch with one of the monks.MIDa102
