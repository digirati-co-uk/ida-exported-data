From left to right: Brave Spirit Band in
Phoenix. Drummers take a break during band
camp. Showing that they are the best, the
drummers give it to the crowd. Entertaining
the crowd, the Band does its best. Rocking to
the beat, Mike rocks back. Getting a good
start before band practice, Theresa and Coy
have breakfast. Our Brave Leader! Marching in
the State Fair Parade, the Brave Spirit Band
took third place.
