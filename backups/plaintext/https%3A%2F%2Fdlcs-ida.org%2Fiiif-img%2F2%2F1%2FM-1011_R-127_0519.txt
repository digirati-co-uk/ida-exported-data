Ramos Archuleta is the leader of the lawlessdrinking element in the pueblo of San Juan,and this iBnot the first assault which has been made by him uponmembers of his pueblo. Both Mr. Wilson and I felt theurgent need of vigorous prosecution for this crime, andI believe the conviction of Ramos has had the e2fect ofcurbing the more lawless acts at San Juan Incident tothe drunkeness in that pueblo, which has been steadilyincreasing since Judge Pope' s decision in the SandovelCabe. It is to be regreted that the sentence imposedby the court did not provide for imprisonment alonerather than the alternative Bentence, as I believe theimprisonment of Ramos Archuleta for assault upon thisboy would have had a much more lasting effect than thepayment of the line imposed, Ramos Archuleta could notpay the line with in the time prescribed by the court,eixty days after the sentence, and at the Bolicitationof his counsel, Mr. Charles Catron of the firm of Catronand Catron of Santa Fe, this time was extended and moretine has been given at intervals by Judge Abbott on suc.cessive applications of counsel.The Indian liquor officers, established in thepueblos of Santa Clara, San Juan and Taos for the sup.pression of the 11 quor tra fic under the federal lawprior to Judge Pope' s decision in the Randoval case,have been retained, pending the appeal in this case tothe Supreme and of the matterCourt final determination.
