To the 1981 Seniors:
The path of knowledge is a never end
ing one, a path filled with every human
emotion.
Although your goal in life may some
time appear hopelessly unattainable,
it is better to have traveled that road
than never have traveled it all all.

Education- a means to success!
Whether it be in your own home or a
vital part of the business world. Now is
the time to put it to good use. Best
wishes for a bright future.
