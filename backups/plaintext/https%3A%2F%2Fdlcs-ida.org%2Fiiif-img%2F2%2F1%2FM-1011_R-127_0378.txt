Annual Report, 1926.
San Juan Agency.
The liquor question does not seriously affect us. The
Superintendent has not seen a drunken Navajo in the three
years of his incumbency. This does not necessarily mean that
none of them indulge in intoxicants when it may be had, but
it does indicate that such indulgence must of necessity be
very limited. These Indians make no intoxicating beverages
or preparations and peyote is wholly unknown to them. Neither
do they purchase proprietary medicines or extracts for beverage
purposes.
The Navajo is not a garnbler. There money is as scarce
and as hard to secure as it is on the San' uan jurisdiction,
there is little danger that any large amounts will be hazarded
upon the turn of a card. They do have Sunday horse- racing
but the betting is usually limited to fron ten cents to a
quarter. The gambling situation is by no means serious.
