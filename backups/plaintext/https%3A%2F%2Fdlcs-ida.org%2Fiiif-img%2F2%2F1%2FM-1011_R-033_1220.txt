EASTERN NAVAJO JURISDICTION.
Our school is very much in need of a home economics building, as
we cannot provide suitable quarters for the industries properly coming
within the scope of this training.
Employees in the main have been interested in the welfare and ad
vancement of the Indian student, and have given their best endeavor to
advance them in the work. The schools for the Indian people must be
such as to educate the Indians with the whole purpose of fitting them
for complete independence and such instruction given as will fit them
for some special profession or trade.
The playground equipment in use consists only of swings and should
be added to as fast as funds are available for this purpose. Supervi
sion of playground activities and games has been given.
This is a semi- arid country, the livestock industry is the main
dependence for a livelihood, both by whites and Indians, but it has been
very emphatically demonstrated that they cannot occupy the same range
or country and for that reason it will be many years before the Govem
ment can place them in position for the Indians to establish and main
tain their own schools.
