І3.one üitcls was dus at a very great expense, and I understand tiratthere is not a drop of water in four niles of it; and witilout greatcare, any noney expended in irrigation won tiiis reservation, will bewitilout benefit; in fact, u less a farner, or some competent person 16conlucea in charge, after tie ditcia is completed, both to see that theyare kept in repair and to silow tie Indians irow to apply the waterto tie ir lands, the aitcies will soon beconie wortlïess; and I shouldsuerest that the Superintendent of Irrigation be instucted to sostruct lis ditcises tiiat a farner located at a certain point canoverlook and superintená a reasonable anount of work. After the ditchesare completed, for want of unity of action ühuong tienselves,they will not kuey tien in repair; and it w111 be necessary thatsone faruer nave cisarge both of the ditci.es, and the Indians wio receive the benefit fron them.Another trouble to contend witi 16 the sand storns wiiich prevailin this section, and it frequently happens that a ditch four by sixwill be conpieteiy filleuwith sand in the course of twenty- four hours,and I have taken occasion to caution tie superintendent to be carefulin locating liis ditcises, in order to avoid this trouble. As I have stateä before, the main trouble grows out of the fact that most of thewater that can be used for irrigating purposes, is in the mountainsWidere tile climate is too colü co produce crops; and another greattrouble yet to be overcone, is tisat wiere most of the water can be securea, f'or lirigut 10! the lands liave been taken up and are claineu inlarge bodies by certain particular Indians 11v1.8 on these streanisanü it will be a very difficult hatter to gte uiten to consent to adivision of these lands with other Indians of tie iribe.I found tire bouts anů accounts of tiis agency correct, and allopen market purolases supporied by proper authorityand correct vouchersand tie.current market- price of articles in this neighborhood as follows, viz.
