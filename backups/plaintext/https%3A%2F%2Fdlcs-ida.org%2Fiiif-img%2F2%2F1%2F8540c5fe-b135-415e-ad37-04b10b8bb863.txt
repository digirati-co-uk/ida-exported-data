Superintendent
of Indian Schools,
Washington, D. C.
Sir:
I have the honor in accordance with paragraph 97, School
Regulations, to report that the following pupils have by their beha.
viour and detrimental influence over my school forced me to send them
to their homes. Two of them George Skye and william Morris are addiot
ed to drink, and, in spite of punishment and warning. they persisted
in introducing intoxicating liquor in this school, aided by the third
person it is believed, and when again punished Skye and William Minor
tho
third pupil, formed their plans to run away from the school. When
spoken to, they acknowledged that they did intend to run away. Their
constant disturbance or the good order of my school and the detrimen
tal influence they bring to bear over the younger pupils rendered the
necessity urgent. I have disciplined them and sent them to their res
pective homes for any idea of improving them further is uselses and
will be a loss of time and money.
Very respectfully,
Reche de
Supt.* Spl, Disb. Agent.
