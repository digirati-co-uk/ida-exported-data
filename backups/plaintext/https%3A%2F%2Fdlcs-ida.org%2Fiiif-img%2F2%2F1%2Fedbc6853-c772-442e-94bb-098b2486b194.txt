Thornton, New Mexico.
Dear Sir:
I am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant in regard
to Mr.Roseberry erooting a new store building at Thornton. I bas to
inform you that he will be compelled to negotiate with tho Pueblo
authorities in this matter, and if they do not wish to have him lo
cate on their lands it will be a simple matter to settle.
The Santa Fe R.R.Co., has a lease of certain lands at Thornton,
and it is possible that Mr.Roseberry will endeavor to get a permit from
the R.R.Co. to build a store there. I have this day written to Mr.
Easly at Las Vegas, The Division Superintendent, and have requested him
to not grant Mr.Roseberry authority to build on any of their leased
land..
Very respectfully,
팅
۔
all
FJM.
Superintendent.
