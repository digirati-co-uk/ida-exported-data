matter. It was made from fruit boxes which the Days got at theschool kitchen. There was nothing touch to be done exceptarrange the boxes after they had decided just how they wantedthe shelves. A counter was made from boards and boxes so thatit would look more like a store.The children wanted to have ever ything in their store thatthey had seen in the trading post her e but a good many thingshad to be out out. We got canned goods and food supplies fromthe school warehouse and article 9 of clothing and a few otherthings from some of the dormitories.After both the store and hogan were completed the boysand girls had a great time painting the store, the furniture,window frames, and door frame, and in arranging the suppliesand furniture.Ever yone wanted to be storekeeper or trader but as thiswas impossible it was decided to take turng at it. Differentfamilies lived in the hogan too. Turns had to be taken heretoo. There was a mother and father and children in the hoganat all times and sometimes there was a grandmother. Home 111ewas carried on it it. Sometimes it was the mother who went tothe trading post to get the supplies, taking with her one orperhaps two of the children while the others played at herdingthe sheep or looking after the children at home. Some timesit was the father who went to the trading post.Everyone seemed to enjoy this unit. There was a good dealof singing going on in the hogan as well as the bustle ofsweeping, dus ting, washing the dishes, washing the goat skineto. The boys had put up. clothes line and made an ironingboard and the girls seemed to never tire of washing the sheets,pillow cases, table covers, etc., and ironing them too with acouple of irons we had which could be heated on the oil stovein the classroon.This unit lasted until the dose of school and even on thelast day long before school took up there was a group of girlswho came to the room to play in the hogan. The ho gan wasalways in demand, both before school and after school and therewas always someone to sleep in it during our daily sleep periods.The Idndergarten group this year consisted of forty children,twenty seven boys and thirteen girls.
