These cases obviously are not on all fours withourpr es ent situation where we have an attempt to tack the possessionof one traot onto the possession of another, one not related toit in any way. The application of the rule in the cases cited,however, is even more strict and more of a hardship than itcould be in the present case. There the tracts were related,and in fact were simply different portions of the same piece ofland. I tacking is not allowed there, how much more impellingis the reason for not allowing it in the case of totally unrelated tracts. The cases which are cit ed by Note 34 above,but which do not merit detailed consider at ion here, follow:VWPotts v. Gilbert, 19 Fed. Cas. 11l. 347.Dietz vs. Mission Transfer Coop6 P& C. 423Ely v. Brown, 56 â€“ N. E. 181 LS49, sr USPeoria etc. Ry Co. v. Tamplin, 40 N. E. 9 60Messer v. Reginnitter, 32 Iowa 312Griffithv.Schwenderman, 27 Mo. 412Mahon R. Co., 64 S. E. 226, P2S Lay 25for ittest showdo 217ckeysOne of these cases, Griffith v. Schwenderman, 27 Mo412, has a headnote that hits the nail on the head." Possession of a parcel that has been occupiedfor twenty years cannot be connected with thepossession for a shorter period of an othertractso as to bring the latter within the operation of the statute of limitations."The facts reflect, however, a situation similar to theoth er cases referred to,in that the two tracts were aifferentparts of one whole parcel of land. The defendant had adversepossession for 20 years of the Lot No. 28, Block 8, which wasin dispute, but 21 years was the statutory period.Defendanttried to tack on one year' s possession by her husband of anoth ere part of the whole 80 acre plot, but without success.
