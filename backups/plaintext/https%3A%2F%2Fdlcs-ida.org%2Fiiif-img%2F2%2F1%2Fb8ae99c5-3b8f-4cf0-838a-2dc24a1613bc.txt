( 26)Section IV, INDUSTRIES:The Pueblo Indians occupy" original grants" of land receivedfrom the Spanish Crown in 1689. They also have acquired lands bypurchase, and certain of the Pueblos have had additional lands setaside for their use under Executive Orders.These landg are in twolarge drainage areas, the valley of the Rio Grande and that of theSan Jose River;while the Jemez and sia grants, on the Jemez river,& northern tributary of the Rio Grande, are practically separatedfrom the others. There are wide differencesin temperature, rainfall, and soil conditions.The ten Pueblo" reservations" under thisAgency may not be classed as one agricultural proposition.The central pueblos, such as San Felipe, Santa Ana, Sandia andIsleta are often inundated by spring floods of the Rio Grande andusually have plenty of water for irrigation, the Laguna and Ac omalands( on the San Jose) suffer for water and would present a conditionmore nearly similar to the Navajo desert were it not for the soil,which is mostly a heavy adobe.Jemez and Sia have a considerableriver to draw from, but the mountainouscharacter of the countrypresents irrigation difficulties, and too they have great areas ofsand dunes.The Pueblos of the Rio Grande, while being most fortunatelysituatedin matter of irrigationpossibilities, also suffer with theother settlersof the Rio Grande valley becauseof too much water.
