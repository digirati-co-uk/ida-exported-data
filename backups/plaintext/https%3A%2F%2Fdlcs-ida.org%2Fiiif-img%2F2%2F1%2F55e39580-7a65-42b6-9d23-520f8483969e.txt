Section IV.- INDUSTRIES( Cont'd)( c)Practicallyall of the Indians go out and hunttheir own jobs and it is better for them when theydo this.( a)There is a period during the winter monthswhen little or no employmentcan be had.( e)The majority of our Indians that go out tolabor are herdersand laborers.POPULATION1.Each pueblo has a council which is supposed to consistof the most intelligentmembers of the tribe. It would beinadvisableto attempt any curtailingof this council.2, The Pueblo Indians receive no annuitiesor funds fromthe Government. The superintendentto some extent supervises,the best he can, the funds coming into the hands of thePueblos. In at least two pueblos a pueblo treasurerhas beendesignatedwho handles the funds of the pueblo subject tothe o. K. of the superintendent. In my judgment this is agood plan to follow. Where the Indians have full control oftheir own .funds, as at San Juan, Taos and Santo Domingo, thepueblo money is often times squandered and wasted.Ð¸dalSuperintendent.Oranento
