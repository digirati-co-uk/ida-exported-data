-6It has been considered by representativesof theIndian Department and the Bureau of Mines in touch withfield conditions, that the Shinarump conglomeratehorizon( Upper Triagsic) might possibly be productive, as inseveral places in Utah it shows considerable saturationand a small amount of oil was secured from that formationin the McElmo well, previously mentioned. Also,& contraryto the general belief, the red shales of the so- calledTriassic red beds', conta in considerable carbonaceousmaterial. Recently, the Southwest Oil Co.( subsidiary tothe Midwest Oil Co.) in drilling their test well on theBoundary Butte structure, 58 miles west of Shiprock, encountered a good amount of 42 gravity oil in the Shina rumpat a depth of 1568. This well at present is producing30barrels of oil per day and 100 barrels of wa ter on the pump.This water is to be shut off in the very near future.The news of this strike of oil in the Shinarump hascreated a greater interest among the local operators andin the near future one or two wells will probably be drilledto that horizon in the Shiprock district. It is believed thatthe Shinarump will be encounteredat approximately3000 to3100 feet wherever the Tocito sandstone outcrops on thestructure, but in the case of the Table Mesa well a depth of3400 to 3500 feet would have to be reached.LENTICULARITYOF DAKOTA.Development, so far, on the Hogback and Rattlesna kestructures has demonstrated the lenticular condition of theDakota sandstone, with its attendant uncertainty of predicting in advance the productiveness of any particular well.It is found by examination of the outcrop of the Da ko tathat it is there extremely lenticular and the writer believesthis condition is responsible for some of its barrenness andalso the presence of water within the productive limits of theHogback field, Definite mention will be made of these particular conditions later on in this report. The Dako ta groupin the Shiprock area is approxima tely 150 to 200 feet thickand is made up of a series of gray to white sandstones separated by a few shale breaks and coal beds. These sandstonesUsually carry either fresh or sulphur water when not productiveof pil.ORIGIN AND ACCUMULATIONOF THE OIL.There has been considerable discussion among thoseinterested in the Hogback field, as to the proba ble origin ofthe extremely high gravity oil found there. It is thought bysome, that the gravity is due to extensive migration from
