U.S. INDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL,
Santa Fe, N, M., August 18, 1892.
To the Hon. Com'r of Indian Affairs,
Washington, D. C.
Sir:
I have the honor to ask the interpretation of Section 241
of the Regulations of the Indian Department.
In granting leaves of absence to employes during the vaca
tion months, I have followed the custom of several of the other
Government Industrial Schools; that is, granting all the literary
Teachers the full leave to which they are entitled under the
25
rules( 3 days for each month's service
not to exceed 30 days,
however), and granting the other employes a leave( so far as pos
sible) by assigning literary Teachers to duty in their places, as
Seamstress, Laundress, Cook, etc.
Does this plan ineet with
your approval?
Very respectfully,
Smileast
Superintendent.
