The expenditures for all purposes during this year will be
increased somewhat from last for the reason that certain labor
saving devices have been purchased from savings and the expendi
tures in the way of improvements have been very much greater as
the entire plant has been renovated and placed in condition for
conducting the Sanatarium School at the agency headquarters. A
bath house has been completed at the Day School, while employees
quarters are being constructed there. In addition to the se im
provements, cement sidewalks have been constructed at both the

apparatus. The play ground is systematically supervised by
employees at all times. The same facilities, in the way of ap
paratus for the girls, as are the boys.
On the Zuni reservation, it will be necessary to continue
the Government schools for a number of years. There are no
whites living, except the ones who are, engaged in trading with
the Indians, or in work among the Indians, and it will be many
years before public school facilities can be afforded the se
Indians.
