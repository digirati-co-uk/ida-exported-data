April 27,Some of the posters had not been finished.We talkedabout doing our work neater, and the ways of making ourposters more effective. They showed by their posters thedifferent ways of killing Ilies, and the ways to keep fliesfrom breeding.I had some screening and strips or thin boards broughtup from the Carpenter Shop. As soon as they saw it, theysaid," Make fly swatters." Most of the boys wished to startright away. We decided how long to make the handle, and thenhow wide to cut the screen. Some of them sewed the edgeswithyarn. We also have a fly trap, so we ought to be ableto kill all the flies around the Hogan.I told them the life story of the fly, and then Iasked them where flies like to stay most. Roy answered,Especially around the pig pen."Later when some childrencame in, and I asked them to tell what we had been talkingabout.Roy said," About that disease business."when all the children were quiet t and working veryhard." Oh- h- h- h tired!" said Harry." I wish I had a chair."Would you really like a chair, perhaps you could make one,"I suggested. He only smiled. They don't like to admit thatthey would prefer to have chairs, because they talked abouthow they would like to sit on the skins, so long before wegot the skins. I am sure they get tired of sitting on thefloor, when they have to sit very long at a time. Some getin a reclining position at times. I feel that this is notbest for reading and most kinds of work, but allow them todo it occasionally, so they can rest.
