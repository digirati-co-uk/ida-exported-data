April 27,
Some of the posters had not been finished.
We talked
about doing our work neater, and the ways of making our
posters more effective. They showed by their posters the
different ways of killing Ilies, and the ways to keep flies
from breeding.
I had some screening and strips or thin boards brought
up from the Carpenter Shop. As soon as they saw it, they
said," Make fly swatters." Most of the boys wished to start
right away. We decided how long to make the handle, and then
how wide to cut the screen. Some of them sewed the edges
with
yarn
. We also have a fly trap, so we ought to be able
to kill all the flies around the Hogan.
I told them the life story of the fly, and then I
asked them where flies like to stay most. Roy answered,
Especially around the pig pen."
Later when some children
came in, and I asked them to tell what we had been talking
about.
Roy said," About that disease business."
when all the children were quiet t and working very
hard." Oh- h- h- h tired!" said Harry." I wish I had a chair."
Would you really like a chair, perhaps you could make one,"
I suggested. He only smiled. They don't like to admit that
they would prefer to have chairs, because they talked about
how they would like to sit on the skins, so long before we
got the skins. I am sure they get tired of sitting on the
floor, when they have to sit very long at a time. Some get
in a reclining position at times. I feel that this is not
best for reading and most kinds of work, but allow them to
do it occasionally
, so they can rest.
