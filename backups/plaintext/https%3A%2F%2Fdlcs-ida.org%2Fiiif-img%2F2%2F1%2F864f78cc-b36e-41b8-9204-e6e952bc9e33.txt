I-8WOOLA decid ed improvement has been made during the past yearin the handling of the Indian s' wool; bet ter prices have beenobtained for the Indians, but I fear at the expense of thetrader, who has been the victim of unscrupulous wholesaleme rchants, spe culators and manipulation of the wool marketin the East.An effort is being made with the co- operation of the traderson the reservation, and large buyers of Navajo blankets, tobring the Indian back to making his wool into blankets, usingnative dies, and weaving blankets of better quality, thenselling at a price based upon quality, and not by weight. Ablanket of most any weave will sell for$ 1.50 per pound; thewool at fifty cents per pound, would in the average blanketcost, say five dollars, the bien ke t at$ 1.50 per pound wouldsell for fifteen dollars, a net profit of ten dollars. Itdoes not matter where the market value of wool drops to, thevalue of a blanket insures the Indian a profit he can neverhope to receive from his wool.When a blanke t can be sold upon a basis of its excellenceof weave and artistic design, there is no limit to its value.The subject of scouring his wool for him, and employing expertIndian dyers to prepare the yarn is under discussion, and it ispossible that the Indians' income from the wool may be materiallyincreased, and his flocks diminish ed, thereby relieving theserious shortage of water and pasturage.There is a popular belief that only the coarser grades of woolcan be used for making blankets; this is an error. The finer gradesare not used by the Indians because of the greater amount of greasein them, and the fact that the Indians have no way to scour it.The long hair in the coarser grades( cow tails) is as objectionableto the weave as the grease in the finer grades.The di stance from this reservation, abscence of tele phone connectionwith the railroad, and bad roads seems to be responsible for veryfew officials visiting and obtaining information of vital importanceto the practical work on the reservation, and as long as reportsand correspondence is depended upon as the source of information,the office will be at a disadvantage, and the reservation willsuffer.A more intimate association between the Indian Office and the Fieldis absolutely necessary to practical operation of both branches ofthe service.
