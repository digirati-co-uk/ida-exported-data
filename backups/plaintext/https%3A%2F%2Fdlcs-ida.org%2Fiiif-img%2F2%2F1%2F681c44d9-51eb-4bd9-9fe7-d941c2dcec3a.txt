the wound cleaned out and the fracture reduced.
But the wound
was severely infected and was frequently reinfected from filthy
surroundings and kind but misdirected Indian care.
There
was,
of course, no union because of infection.
A neighboring phy
sician was summoned and the bone was wired, but still he was
cared for by unskilled Indians and the results were negative,
80 as a last resort he was taken to a private hospital, where
he died the next day under an anaesthetic.
What should have
been done under the circumstances was immediato amputation.But
with an agency hospital or any other in which he could have been
placed immediately, I think both life and limb could have been
saved.
The Indians need a hospital more than white persons, if
they are going to adopt the white man's medicine, because their
methods are different from ours, and, when you mix the two, you
are very apt to discard what is good and have a double portion
of the bad.. So our most urgent need is an agency hospital with
a sufficient number of trained nurses and perhaps a medical in
torn.
There should be a skilled and well trained surgeon, who
might be in charge of several hospitals located at different
field points always ready to consult with the field physician.
