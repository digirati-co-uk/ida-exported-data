- 3-we have two boys' buildings, and se pere ting the smallboys from the larger boys, makes it much easier and betterfor the boys.The drinkingof strong liquor by the pupils hasnever been known to occur here, and I believeit is forthis reason the t I can properlystate that we hardly everhave an incorrigiblepupil. We have no jail and none isrequired.As our course of study has been followed, I amglad to say that we have boys and girls capableof takingup more advancedwork or to go out and make their living.we have few really incorrigibles. Punishmentis usuallyconfinedto extra work, etc.The pupils going out to make their living fromthis school find that their greatesttrouble or handicapis that the people they work for, or come in contact with,do not appreciatethat they have attended a federalschoolof good standingand have completeda standardcourse ofstudy, and they, therefore, place them on a lower plane,and either go to one extreme or the other by either pettingthem, so to speak, or regardingthem entirely as servants,and not associates.Most of our returnedstudentshave turned out well,are now living in the cities earninggood wages, or aremarried and have settled on farms. The majorityhowever,have gone to the city. There are some, I regret to ste te,have not proved successfulin selectingwork and haveeither married badly or are idlers and worthlessto themselves and everybodyelse,The Academic departmentof our school is fairlywell equipped, includinga library of 1200 books, or more,with periodicals,- and also a moving picture machine.Educationalfilms are shown twice a week during the schoolyear and this is much benefitto the childrenin additionto furnishingamusement.
