Annual Report 1913.
The Navajos are provided with wagons, mowers,
harrows, plows, hay rakes, shovels, hoes, garden rakes,
axes and matto cks. These implements are issued to them
and paid for in labor. As a rule they are well taken care
of.
with the exception of about seventy- five very
ola, blind, crippled Indians, all are self- supporting.
The improvements generally found on their
places, are:- good stone houses built out of stone and
logs, corrals, sheds for implements, and from five to ten
acres fenced.
The Indian pupils employed under the supervision
of Mr. Dagnette showed very good results last year. This
was due to having an employee with them to supervise and
have them keep regular hours.
