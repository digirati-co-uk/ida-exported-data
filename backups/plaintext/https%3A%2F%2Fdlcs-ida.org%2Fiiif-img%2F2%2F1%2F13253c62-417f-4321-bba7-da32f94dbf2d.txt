Every day some of the children watered the plants.
When I arrived at the Hogan this morning, Marcelino had
put some fertilizer in the window boxes. I think he had
seen other people on the campus do that way, so he thought
that was what the plants needed.
We looked at each of the pictures in the Health Book,
and we discussed how they could be improved by making the
drawings neater etc. We fixed up the ones we had already
made instead of making a new page.
I asked them how they knew when water was boiling,
for we had talked about putting boiling water on the dishes
to kill the germs.
Marcelino
When it dances on there."
Lindy i'when the steam comes off." WWhen the water goes
up and down."
Hvery chance the boys have they sit on the one chair
we have in the hogan. If they can find a box, they bring
that in. Two of them are sitting on boxes now. Roy and Earl
try to sit on the book shell. Some of the others I find try
ing to balance themselves on the lapboards. Ben said," Tired,
I wish I had a chair. I am very tired sitting on the skins."
I suggested that he could make a chair. Mostoof
them reply when I say that," It is too hard to make, Govern
ment chair be all right." It is almost the close of school,
and they seem to be getting very lazy and tired. They do not
seem to care to do much construction or building now.
