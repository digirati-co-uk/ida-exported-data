I think he hadseen other people on the campus do that way, so he thoughtthat was what the plants needed.We looked at each of the pictures in the Health Book,and we discussed how they could be improved by making thedrawings neater etc. We fixed up the ones we had alreadymade instead of making a new page.I asked them how they knew when water was boiling,for we had talked about putting boiling water on the dishesto kill the germs.MarcelinoWhen it dances on there."Lindy i'when the steam comes off." WWhen the water goesup and down."Hvery chance the boys have they sit on the one chairwe have in the hogan. If they can find a box, they bringthat in. Two of them are sitting on boxes now. Roy and Earltry to sit on the book shell. Some of the others I find trying to balance themselves on the lapboards. Ben said," Tired,I wish I had a chair. I am very tired sitting on the skins."I suggested that he could make a chair. Mostoofthem reply when I say that," It is too hard to make, Government chair be all right."
