40- Hopihere this year. Sone of the Indians are using water for irrigatingand we are planning to help them by giving them a little labor, andissuing them cement, pipe, valves, etc., as needed and reconmendedby our stockinen.We plan to hold all she stuff and sell no beef this fallexcepting prime steers on account of the pow price- preferring toget rid of our surplus goats and old sheep. We also have plannedto eat as amyn goats as we can in all our schools to cut theirnumber down. We are urging Indians to eat goats in preference toany other meat.We have held meetings with reservation traders, alltogether at one time, encouraging their friendly and efficientco- operation in all our plans above mentioned.We aim to build a few chapter houses this year,organizing chapters for the further encouragement of our fieldwork and keeping up the interest of the Indians in the IndirectRule plan and in handling their own problems. These chapter houseswill be either at our dipping vats or at field nurses's units, asapproved by office. We have several up already, using them forvarious meetings of employees and Indians- to the great advantageof the general field and health work.E. K. M.
