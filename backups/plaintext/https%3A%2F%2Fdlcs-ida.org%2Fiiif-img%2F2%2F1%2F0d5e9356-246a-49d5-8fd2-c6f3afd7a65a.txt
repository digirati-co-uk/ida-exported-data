KEAMS CANYON SCHOOL.
This is one of the most important and best schools on
the Navajo Agency.
It is especially intended for the educa
tion of the Moquis.
Under the Superintendency of Mr. Meagley
this school is well managed and the utmost harmony exists among
the employees.
The school is isolated from the Moqui villages
and under the influence of the teachers much progress is made in
educationg them.
They are bright and quick to learn.
There is
not much interest taken among the Moquis in regard to schools, but
through the influence of Mr. Meagley there was an attendance of
87 on December 7th and this should be considered very good.
In
fact it is about all this school will accomodate with its present
dormitorios.
It should be increased to accomodate at least
200 scholars, all of the Moqui children that could be induced to
attend school, and I shall refer to this matter further on.
The
whole number of Moqui children is estimated to be about 400. The
teachers of this school are especially to be commended for their
attention to their duties.
A principal teacher was lately as
signed to this school by the name of Mr. Bost, but he had not en
tered fully upon his duties when I was
there- he has the appear
ance of being well qualified.
Miss Robinson is especially
well
qualified as a teacher and all the others so far as I was able to
learn.
The ma tron Miss Wind is especially well qualified for
the position which she holds.
She has lately been transferred
from the Albuquerque Indian Training School, but as it separated
her from her husband who is employed at the Albuquerque School,
she would like, if possible, to be allowed to join her husband,
or her husband allowed to join her at the Keams Canyon School,
