April 30,We looked over the lapboards to see that they had allbeen finished. The class acted as judges to see which oneshad been done most carefully.Some children had been playing around the Hogan overthe week- end, so we decided that we better clean up the yard.We reviewed the details again about how the trash should bedisposed of.Some of the fly swatters had not been finished aroundthe edge with the yam, but Kee had a very neat looking flyswatter. I mentioned that kee did very neat work, and hekept himself neat and clean.Andy" He is related to white people, that's why,"Willie" Yes, he is part white."I had brought a chair up to the Hogan. Ben was thefirst one to sit in it.Ben" I am going to sit all day in this chair.Lindy, Enilio, Harry and Ben all had their turn beforethe day was over. The girls do not talk much when the boysare around, but after school they told me that they liked tosit on chairs better than on the skins.The skins are getting quite dirty, so we took some ofthem to be cleaned in the sawdust. We sweep so much dirtand dust from the floor every night, although the floor isvery hard, some dust is rubbed up every day.We soaked some willowsand wagon hoops to preparethem for the chairs. So many of the children seem to wishfor chairs, so we are going to try to make some..
