April 30,
We looked over the lapboards to see that they had all
been finished. The class acted as judges to see which ones
had been done most carefully.
Some children had been playing around the Hogan over
the week- end, so we decided that we better clean up the yard.
We reviewed the details again about how the trash should be
disposed of.
Some of the fly swatters had not been finished around
the edge with the yam, but Kee had a very neat looking fly
swatter. I mentioned that kee did very neat work, and he
kept himself neat and clean.
Andy" He is related to white people, that's why,"
Willie" Yes, he is part white."
I had brought a chair up to the Hogan. Ben was the
first one to sit in it.
Ben" I am going to sit all day in this chair.
Lindy, Enilio, Harry and Ben all had their turn before
the day was over. The girls do not talk much when the boys
are around, but after school they told me that they liked to
sit on chairs better than on the skins.
The skins are getting quite dirty, so we took some of
them to be cleaned in the sawdust. We sweep so much dirt
and dust from the floor every night, although the floor is
very hard, some dust is rubbed up every day.
We soaked some willows
and wagon hoops to prepare
them for the chairs. So many of the children seem to wish
for chairs, so we are going to try to make some..
