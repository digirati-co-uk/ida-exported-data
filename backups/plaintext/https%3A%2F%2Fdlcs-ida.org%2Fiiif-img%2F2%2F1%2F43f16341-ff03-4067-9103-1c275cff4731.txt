As I extend greetings and congratulationsto the Class of 1953, I wish that I had the power of words to convey to you the sobering sense of responsibilitywhich wa feel for you and your future. As adults, we sometimeswish that we might always assume that responsibility. Of course, that is neither possible nor desirable. Only as you shoulder the job of self- direction can you hope to grow in stature and maturity.Your Class belongs to the vanguard of the more than one hundred thousand Indian children enrolled in public, mission and Federal schools across the United States. The soundness of your training, your sense of responsibilityand your ability to work with other people will pave the way not only for your own success but also for the thousands who will follow in your footsteps. Go forth with confidence, with heads held high and with the resolution to meet the challenge of life without falteringor retreating.Sincerely,Vernon L. Beggs; Area Director of SchoolsYour Class of 1953 is the largest graduatingclass this accreditedHigh Schoolhas ever had. We are proud of that fact," for in numbers there is strength". Asi write this, you are diligentlyassemblinga School Annual at no small cost in work, time and money. In your work on this project I have seen increasingsigns of tearr work with each other and with staff members. I have also seen signs of real apprecia tion and thoughtfulnessfor others. These things thrill us who work with you, for these things are signs that you have built the foundationsof a happy, mature personalityand a strong democraticphilosophy. As you read, and re- read this 1953 Teguayo, pian continuallyhow you can pass the benefits you have received on to others and thus develop a stronger, happier world democracy. You can do tremendousthings by the chain- reactions you start in good causes. God speed you.Sincerely,William M. Hemsing, Principal U. S. Indian Schoci
