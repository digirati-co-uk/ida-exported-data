I have the honor to request authority to expend a sum not exceed.
ing$ 140.00 in the open market purchase of turkey for Thanksgiving
and Christmas Dinners for the pupils of this school, as well as for
such other necessaries, as may be required on these occasions.
Last year$ 140.00 was granted for this purpose, and the attende
ance at that time was but 200.
We now have an attendance of 255- every
one of them on the grounds
By Thanksgiving there will be at least
280 in attendance, and not less than 300 by Christmas.
If the Appro

In view of the above facts I respectfully ask your favorable
consideration of this request.
Vory respectfully,
Your obedient servant,

Superintendent
