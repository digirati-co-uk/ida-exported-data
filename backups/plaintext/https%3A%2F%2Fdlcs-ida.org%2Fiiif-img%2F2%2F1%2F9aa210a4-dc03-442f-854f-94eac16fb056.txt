O-/ 4other days are given over to dancing but there is no waste oftime in this regard.These people are hard working and to me1t seems that a days diversion of this kind is not to be condemned when there 18 nothing better at hand to take its place.The otherwise monotonous pueblo life of the child isvaried somewhat by the occasional trip to the ranch or mountainsand this adds much real pleasure to the childs life. The Indian cchild has very few of the toys and play ground equipment thatadds much to the white childs play- day life, yet withali ne 18possibly more content with the few crude things he has than arethey with the many.The Indians of Casa Blanca, Paraje and Seama give aNew Years Dinner about the first of each year in which from 150to 200 people are feasted arter the fashion of the white man.For order, neatness and cleanliness and the abundance of allkinds of palatable foods, this occasion is unsurpassed by nativereasts.The diners are served at tables spread with nice freshlinen and supplied with silverware, china etc.The dinner 18served for the most part by the younger element of the villagesbut all aid in making it a success.Almost everything that is goodto eat is served on this occasion and the spirit of fellowshipabounds.Children are especially provided for and made happy onthis day and by them it is looked forward to and greatly enjoyed.This day is a great factor for good and shows the right kind ofspiritand real progress.
