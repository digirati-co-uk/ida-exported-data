Annual Report1926Northern Pueblos AgencySanta Fe, N. M.NARRATIVE SECTIONSection 1-Law and Order1. The Northern Pueblos, located in Santa Fe, own no buildings or property. Employees rent their own quarters: officequarters are rented at$ 75.00 a month. The agency pays$ 25.00 per month for warehouse and on an average about thesame for storage of automobiles. There is an old FederalBuilding in Santa Fe as well as a new one. For the pastthree years it has been impossible to secure any sort ofquarters or rooms for the agency headquarters and there arelittle or no prospects ahead. Our present quarters includetwo rooms, vault, book room, and stationery room. Ourpresent rooms are approximately 16x24 and 24x30 which includes the vault. The office should have three rooms, two16x18 and one 16x24, also a vault. This is only an approximate estimate of size of rooms needed.2. The office force consists of, besides the superintendent,chief clerk, assistant clerk, stenographer, and general mechanic, all stationed at the agency headquarters, and does notinclude two farmers, one stockman, one regular physician, andone contract physician stationed in the field,3.We have little difficulty or trouble in maintainingorder among the various pueblos. In those pueblos wherethere are two strong factions we have some difficulty inkeeping them from quarreling over water rights, etc,4. Inasmuch as the Pueblos have a well organized government in most of the villages, crimes and serious offensesare not common.5. Indian dances are common in practically all of thepueblos: most of these dances are of a semi- religiouscharacter. The dances are being more or less commercializedand Indians leave the pueblo to dance at fairs, fiestas, etc.They get paid for these but at the same time it all tends tolessen their interest in farming.( a) I would not recommend any special action tobe taken regarding dances.
