Section III.--- Schools( cont.)
has been accomplished during the past year, than any year
preceding. A better system was inaugurated in the industrial
and literary departments, which caused a decided improvement, that
was very noticeable in the pupils at the close of the school
term.
Our neighbors consist entirely of Mexican
people, who are very friendly with the Indians. The Mexican lan
guage predominates.
The total expenditures, for all purposes con
nected with the schools, for the fiscal year 1911, was$ 13850.52,
compared with the expenditure of$ 18044,61, dur ing the fiscal
year 1910, a difference of$ 4194.09. The decrease was partly
caused by finally suoceeding in the construction of a good reser
voir and better water system, which had formerly necessitated a
continuous expense. All repairing and improving that has been
done, during the past year, was absolutely necessary, and
I
consider that the school plants are in excellent condition.
