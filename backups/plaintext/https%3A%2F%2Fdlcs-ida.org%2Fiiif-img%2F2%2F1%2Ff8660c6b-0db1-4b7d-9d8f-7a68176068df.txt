Department of the Interior,UNITED STATES INDIAN INSPECTION SERVICE,- 2-, 189...Indians in regard to education, which I have entered into more nullyin my report of the Pueblo. Agency. The school at present has an enrollment of 266, and, although early in the season, this is an increase of 25% over the enrollment and attendance as reported June 30,1898. The School is limited in its present accommodations to lessthan 300, according to the rule as lately promulgated by the HonorableCommissioner of Indian Affairs. At the rate at which applicationsare being made for enrollment in these schools, it will not be longuntil the limit will be reached. Mr. Viets in his reports to theHonorable Commissioner has stated it as his belief that an enrollmentcan be had of over 600. I believe that Mr. Viets does not over- estimate this matter. He is anxious that provisions be made for aschool of that capacity. With that end in view, he has submitted tothe Honorable Commissioner estimates for buildings, additions and inprovements to be made. The amount estimated for this purpose is verylarge,$ 72, 000. 00. It is not probable that the Department, with itslimited appropriation for school buildings, would apportion thatamount out at one time, but I have made a careful examination into hisestimates and the needs of the school, and I am of the opinion thatthat a mount of money would not be misplaced. I think the Departmentshould comply with Mr. Viets' request so far as possible in assistinghim to increase the capacity of this School, from time to time as theymay think the appropriation for school buildings will allow.There is at present being erected a school- room and auditorium
