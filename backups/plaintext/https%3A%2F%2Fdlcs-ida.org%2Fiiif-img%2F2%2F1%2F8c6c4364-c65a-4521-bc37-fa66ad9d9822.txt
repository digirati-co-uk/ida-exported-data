There has been no infraction of the laws of the she or nation
by the pupils of the school. Generally, the pupils are well- bensved
and orderly. Pupils have not purchased and used extracts or proprietary
medicines for beverages, and they are not addicted to the use of
intoxicating liquors. Four Navaho boys-- two of whom entered school
this year
are the exceptions in this case.
A Moxic an, known to one
of the boys, gave the four some whiskey, of which they partook. Tone
of the boys Imew the Nexican' s name or where he could be found, there
fore, no effort was made to prosecute him.
The last state legislature passed a resolution submitting the
question of state wide prohibition to a vote of the people. The vote
will occur on the sixth day of November next, and the prospects are
good for the measure carrying. The sentiment in favor of Prohibition
is growing in New Mexico with the whites, native population, and with
the Indians.
