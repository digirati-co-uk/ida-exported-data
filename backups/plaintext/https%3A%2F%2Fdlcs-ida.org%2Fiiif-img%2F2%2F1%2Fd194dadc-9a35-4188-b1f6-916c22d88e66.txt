â€¢ 10-The personnel of the hospital at the agency consistsof one senior physician, one junior physician, one head nurse, threestaff nurses, four ward attendants, one cook, and one assistant cook.The Toadlena hospital has a personnel of one physician, one nurse, ono cook, and one assistant.In the field are one Govornmont nurse and twoEastern Association nurses. One of these has been located at Navaabout a year and the other at Rodrock just recently.The agency hospital is now running to capacity:without any field work being done, is poorly constructed and whollyinadequate. It is located in the flood zone, where every three or fouryears the water gets three or four feet deep. The equipment is poor,and the condition of the building would not justify any repairs orenlargement. The foundation is bad, and the building itself beinga wooden structure, is virtually a fire trap. The hospital consistschiefly of two large wards with no call system, no isolation, nostorage rooms, no refrigeration, antiquated plumbing, a heatingplant that will have to be replaced within a year, its water supplyfor both drinking and kitchen use having to be hauled twenty- fivemiles, and its light being provided by a Kohler plant of small capacity and in such bad need of repair that it will have to be replacedwithin the next year.The Toadlena hospital, though it is a frame structure with a good heating plant, with a good water supply, and in goodrepair, is not equipped to handle anything but medical cases of notvery serious nature. As it has no equipment besides beds, a fewsimple instruments, and drugs, it is suitable only as an infirmary.Before any more can be done with the matter ofhealth in this jurisdiction it will be necessary to build hospitalfacilities to take care of the already crying needs that have beenfelt without any field work having been done. By having one medicalofficer and an ambulance making regular trips to these isolated communities where the field nurses can direct him to the sick cases, weshould be able to fillla hospital and a sanitarium of 175 beds, as inthe four months of our work in this jurisdiction we have had to turnaway many tubercular patients and at times general patients for lackof hospital facilities. If we expect to do anything with the tuberculosis situation among the Nava jos, it will be necessary first ofall to hospitalize the terminal cases, not with the idea of securing acure or an arrest but to get them away from their families and friends,To go on as in the past seeing many Indians,carelessly prescribing and dispensing, giving the Indian any kind ofmedicine he asks for, which has only too frequently been done, withoutgiving him the benefit of surgery or careful examinations, withoutgiving him some thing tangible that he can see is superior to what theMedicine Man can give him, we are really only making a bad situationworse. It is the Medicine Man, averaging one in every ten in thepopulation, who with his great hold on the people is largely responsible
