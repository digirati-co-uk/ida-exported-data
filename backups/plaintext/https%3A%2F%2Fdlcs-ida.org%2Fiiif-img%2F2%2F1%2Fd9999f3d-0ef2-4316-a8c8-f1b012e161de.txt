- 2-stallation is a suo00 8s and during the summer of 1924 it is plannedto make all the water soft by the installation of additional equipmentfor which Congress provided funds for the fiscal year 1925.Careful wateh is kept over the pupils at all time 8. Fach and everyemployee has been instructed to notice the least symptoms that may beobserved in a child and at once send such child to the hospital foroboDTvation and treatment.The dispensary is obviously an extremely important branch of thehospital oquipment. Hore the children can come with the most insignificant ai Lmont or injury and be treated at once, and this early treatment has undoubtedly saved much trouble.The equipment of the hospital I would call fairly good, but thearrangements for isolating contagious and infectious casos on the girls'side of the house are rather awicward. There is only one entrance to theward where such cases are usually isolated, and to gain this entranceono must go thru the entire section occupied by the girls, and, of course,must leave in the same manner. It is evident such is not the best arrangement. A supply of trachoma- treatment equipment is to be purchasedin the summer of 1924, per recent order of the Office, so that ourinstruments and equipment in this line will be very materially improved.The sleeping porches in connection with the hospital and the smallboys' building are invaluable.There are still a large number of pupils in this school whose teethneed the services of a good dentist. It would be well to have a dentistsent here again to remedy the defects, thus perhaps oliminating somelocal infection. Most of the pupils attending this school come fromhomes where the parents are very poor and unable to send the childrenmoney with which to pay dental bills in the town near by.
