Hopi Indian Agency
through such& body, it would be a wonderful advantage to
thom in their efforts for further progress. We have a number
of Hopis who moet with us in this Navajo council, and they
feel the same way about the matter and are working to get
such a council through which the affairs of the Hopis could
be administered. The value of such services by these Indians
can not be counted or properly estimated. Everything of in
portanoe goes through this council of the Navajos-- everything
which affects their condition-- and it is only through their
cooperation that we are able to work together in such fine
harmony and with such splendid results.
These Indians, fortunately for them, have never received
any funds or annuities or shares from trust funds excepting
the oil monies as participated in by the Navajos during the
last two years, recently from their oil activities in the
Farmington district. This money has been spent to improve
the roads and for the development of water, in accordance
with the plans of the Indians and with the approval of the
Indian Oflice. It is the wish of the Indians that this money
be spent for these purposes and for their general benefit and
improvement.
Respectfully submitted,
