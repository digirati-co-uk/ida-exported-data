Santa Fe, N, M. Vay 13, 1898.
Hon Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
#ashington, D.C.
gir:
I have the honor to report that by office Lottor dated May 7, '98,
Finepce 3664-1701.3. Autho 56515, ust received, I en directed to roolivo
informal bids for material and labor for roofing the main school
building
I have consulted experts in this line of work and all
infor me that the work cannot be completed by the first of July.
They say taat the material can easily be delivered, but if all
the rooiers in this section could be engaged on this work they would
Vor finish it by at time.
is causes me to request explicit instructions from you on this
matter as you are aware I am required to turn back all unexpended
funds remaining on hand July Ist, 1898, and it will be a great injury
to the building to take off the old roofing and leave the work partly
done.
If you can authorize me to go on with the work after July 1, 1898
and report the labor as long as it lasts and return this money during
the First quarter of 1899, there will be no difficulty in having the
job completed, and as I will get the work well on to completion before
