During July and August the entire attention of the two
available men, the Superintendent and one Clerk, was occupied
with the closing of the old year's accounts, both cash and
property, the statistical section of the Annual Report, and
the routine business that never stops.
Nearly ten days of my August time was taken up with Snake
Dances, visitors, and the conference with Chief Special Officer
Larson, who came to the reservation with four deputies in an
effort to clarify the liquor situation;
Next came the visit of Supervisor Lipps, with special
direction to examine into the schools situation. I travelled
300 miles with Supervisor Lippe, inspecting schools, planning
improvements, sites, etc.
The visit of Special Accountant Rapp, with instructions as
to the new accounting system, occupied no little part of my time
and the entire time of the one clerk for ten days;
The Second Liberty Loan Bond selling campaign was not
accomplished by whistling at the Indians. It required councils
at three separate points and the travel of 100 miles on the
reservation; and thereafter the travel of 200 miles to get the
bonds recorded properly;
Then came the second smallpox roar from Indian Wells and
the visit of Special Physician White to investigate same;
Then another conference with Chief Special officer Larson
at railroad to review proposed methods to strangle the liquor
traffio;
An exhibit for the State Fair at Phoeniz, beginning November
12, 1917 has taken some little time in the preparation;
Through the entire month of October the Livestock Selling
Season required the attention of something more than a stenographer.
while the Narrative Section and Census of the Annual Report
required a stenographier to assist in compiling, or a competent
typist, it is submitted that the above things required a
Superintendent. Yet the criticism is that the Superintendent
should have abandoned the above named things and confined himself
to an office as a stenographer and typist.
All the routine correspondence and a large part of the
Narrative Section of the Annual Report have been completed by
the Superintendent working as a typist at night, after having
worked the day as a superintendent, and will be filed just as
soon as physical endurance permits. I shall very gladly
welcome additional clerks to assist at this very necessary work,
and it is respectfully submitted that until we get such clerks,
two men, the Superintendent and the Clerk appointed, will have to
do the work of four men, as they have been doing since July 1, 1917.
