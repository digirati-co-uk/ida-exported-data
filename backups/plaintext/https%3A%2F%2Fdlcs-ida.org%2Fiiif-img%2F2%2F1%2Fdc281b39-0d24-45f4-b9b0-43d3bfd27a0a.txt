Monday, May% TueDay, May 8,
We talked about the work wo needed to do before the
close of school. We finished working on the skins that we
were tanning. Some of them got very dry, and they were hard
to stretch and pull. It took a great deal of work to make
them sort, and the boys got very tired,
Three of the boys went after some groen cedar to mako
the hoop part of the chair. It had to be shaved down, and
bent into shape.
The boys wanted to take a walk to get some flowers,
We decided that the best place to get some good rich 8011
would be under the codar troes.
So we took our boxes with
us and filled them with dirt. Some of the boys dug up some
wild flowers which they thought would be pretty to have in
the boxes.
Wednesday
, May 9,
A lady offered to give us some Morning Glory plants.
Two of the boys went after thom. when they returned, we
talked about how they should be got out.
We were very caro
ful about not injuring the roots. Vo sprinkled them with
wator, and kept them shaded.
We thought it would be nice to make another page for
our Health Book. Several suggestions were mdo and then we
decided that, washing the hands before cooking, was a very
important thing to remember.
So they drew a lady washing
her hands.
Thursday, May 10,
We made another page for our Health Bock. Who
talked about the importance of washing the dishes arter
the meal. We decided the best way to cloan the dishes
was soap and water, but they could use clean sand.
