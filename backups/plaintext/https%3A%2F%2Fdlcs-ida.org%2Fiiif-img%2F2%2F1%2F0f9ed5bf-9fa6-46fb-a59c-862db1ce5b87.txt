safe plac es to play and why. Avery good picture of a fire was
drawn by Milton and a discussion of it led to the following
original story:
Fire!
Bell
ring
,
Line up, line up.
Whistle
is blowing.
Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo- 000,
Boop- boo.
Run fast-
Faster still.
Ralph and Harold run fast.
Harold first.
The sand road proved hard to keep in place. Some of the children
tried banking the road with clay, but this was unsatisfactory.
During a group discussion, the children decided to use small stones
which prov ed to be much better.
Then some of the children wanted some small dolls for play.
Some of the boys and girls worked to dress the wire dolls to be
used in play. These dolls helped develop dramatic play to a
satisfying extent. Trucks on the road took a purpose such as
hauling meat or flour for the children, taking the children on a
picnic and many other local activ ities.
Most of the children took some responsibilities in getting
materials and tools put away, the room clean and neat after work
periods. Some took took the responsibility of counting to see
that nothing was lost. They learned to quit work in time to
clean
before
the bell rang.
