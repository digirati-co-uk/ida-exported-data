PAHE-- NAVAJOMynameandsawcame tobranchesand girlsd leaves.I live in this Great West, the cheapest plant you can find in the world. I don' t need anysupport from anybody. All I want is rain and sunshine. All the friends I have are theIndians and animals. I furnish food for the animals, especially in the Spring time, when Iam fresh and green, just when the horses and cattle are real tired of eating dry hay. They arealways glad to see me green and fresh in the Spring and I am always glad to see them too,for I want them to get fat so their master can make better money out of them. For my friends,the Indians, I help them in the loneliness of their lives. They pound me and put me inwater and drink me when they have any kind of sickness such as headaches. They evenuse me for bathing purposes. Indians are my best friends for they pray for rain. I don' tneed money or work to make my living. I live in the mountains and plains. I am sorry tosay that the farmers are my worst enemies in this world, while they are your best friendsI am just a sage brush.2 makinge pictureI am toAutobiography of an Indian ShoeBy LOUISE QOTAHONGVA — HOPIw in theתבחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכחכתכתבתכתבתךery goode up andMy name is Moccasin and I live in New Mexico and Arizona. I am useful to thousandsof Indians. I am useful because I can travel day after day till I am worn out. I don' t needvery much attention because I can travel without being watered or fed. The only time Ineed attention is when my soles are worn out, then I have to be resoled or patched. I amcomfortable and suitable for anyone. I have no heel. I have a sole made of rawhide andmy top is made of soft buck skin which is stitched to the sole with tendon. My top comesabove the ankles and is held by silver buttons. An Indian man made me and my brother forhis little boy who takes us all over the mountains and mesas near his home.LELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELCLCLCLCLCLCULUÇUŞLEUEUEUEUEUEUEUEUEUEUEUELEwe areming toto us orcome inney sendfor theny placeA Week in the WoodsBy CLARENCE WESLEY--- APACHEcars agoIn the mountains of Arizona in the month of July, we camped in the woods. We hada little log cabin with four rooms in it, a bed room, a kitchen, a dining room, and a livingroom. On the south side of the cabin, we had a stall within the corral for our horses.Around the place was a pasture about four miles square. Each morning when the horsesfelt like coming home, they did; otherwise we hunted them up and brought them home.We had lots of fun hunting and riding every day, but the main purpose was to be on thelookout for forest fires.1 differttentionpassedhat theymuch tohere toce neverIZUZLCLCLCLCULUCULUCULUCULULUCUCUÇUCUCUDUCUCUÇUCUCULUCUCUÇUCUCUCUCUCURUPURIתכחכחכתכתבותכותבתכתבותכותבחבתכתבותכתבותכתבותכותבותכתבותכתבותלוחתכתבותכותבתכחכחכחכחכחלחל
