And the thanks go to...
One of the dangers of trying to thank people is that you will leave someone out.
So many people deserve thanks for making this yearbook possible that we cannot
neglect to express gratitude, nor can we do it without risking an omission. We will
do our best, however, to cover each and every person.

Thank you to the School Board for
all the wonderful things that you

a school, much less a yearbook,
and you have our respect and
admiration.
