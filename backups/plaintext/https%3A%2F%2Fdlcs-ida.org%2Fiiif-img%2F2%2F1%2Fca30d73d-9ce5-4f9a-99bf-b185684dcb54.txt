Sir:
I englese
horowith
a letter
from
Miss
M.L.
91? cott
, Principal
and
Sal
Teacher
, and I ask your
serious
consideration
of her
request
.
There
is not
a teacher
herÂº
who
can
manege
a high
grade
section
,
and
while
Miss
Busby
has had
the
4th
and
5th
grades
, I am sure
she has
not
done
then
justice
especially
in mathematics
, besides
, she has
joined
the
discordant
element
, hero
and
has
been
dissatisfied
for
a long
time
and
has
stated
to me repeatedly
that
she
would
get
a transfer
next
year
, and
I hope
you will
give
it to her
and
in her
place
send
me a
good
teacher
.
I am also
fearful
that
a mistake
has
been
made
in transferring
iss
Dissette
here.
I thought
of course
she
was
a good
teacher
buls
she says
she cannot
teach
even
the 2nd
and 3rd
grades
and has
dil'ficulty
in teaching
the lower
grades
,
She says
she is a Matron
and not
a teacher
and
sooms
to want
to
go az matron
to Cherokee
School
, N. C.
If possible
, I think
she
would
be more
useful
in this
capacity
, and if she asks
for
such
a
transfer
I would
endorso
it.
Very
respectfully
Psih
Supt.c
Speci.Di
& ogo Agent
