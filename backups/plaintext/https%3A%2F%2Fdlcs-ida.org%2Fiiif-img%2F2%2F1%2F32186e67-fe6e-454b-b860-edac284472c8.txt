Santa Fe, New Mexico,
July 30, 1892.
To the Hon.
Commissioner
of Indian Affairs,
Washington, D. C.
Sir:
I deem it advisable to make a special report on the water
question, as related to Dawes Indtitute, in this city.
This has
been a serious problem from the beginning of the school,
The well due, at the starting of the school, is 121 feet
deep, five feet in diameter at the bottom, and has prom 3 to 6
feet of water ordinarily.
The water is pumped into a tank, by a
windmill.
It requires considerable power to elevate the water
135 feet.
The wind lere 19 frequently very strong, but it is
an uncertain quantity, leaving the tank empty very often, and
seldom filling it to the top.
Hence the top part of the tank be
comes dry, and in a leaky condition, when the water rises to its
greatest height,
This well is the only source of water, at present, and no
water can be epared for the garden,
The hope of getting water
to irrigate the school garden from the Santa Fe river has this
season proved a l'ailure having been absorbed by parties whose
lands are between the school and the river,
Only twice heat
