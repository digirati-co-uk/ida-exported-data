EASTERN NAVAJO SCHOOL
Crown Point, N. M.
Annual Report----- 1933--1934.
" thel bor, Art Teacher.
ART
B. valuate Curriculum.
1. Favorable Side: orfers large varilty of material fromhotelah
to chooso.
II. Dofoota:
Some work to hard for the class.
Too muah busy work under Art.
III. Bencomenda tions: Personally, I do bot feel prepared to
oriticizo trt standards, so I think it
would be better to accept some good,
standard Art course that includes the
essential principle of art expression, such
as colbr, balance, proportion, rhythm,
harmony, and form, --and then ad just thom
to our problems as we need to present
them to the Nava jo child to meet hos
life needs and adjustments.
14. Materials unsuit, I did not teach art to the A- B- C levels, but
ed to level as some of the material seems too hard to me.
in curriculu,. Also some seems more like busy work material.
Transparencies.
Marbled
paper
.
Books and Portfolios.
Decorated boxes.
Decorating trays.
Coat hangers
.
Vases.
Ash trays.
Dolls.
Needle gases.
Puppets.
Towels.
Costumes for drama tizaion.
Bolts and weaoing.
of course some A classes might be older, but
I am thinking of an average age child in
kindergarten.
The other levels do not have too difficult work,
but some would belong more to class room than to
Art.
V. Suggestions
It seems to me that a crafts class would answer
the needs more than an art class.
This could include needle work, weaving, wood
decorating, knitting, macrame, carving, pottery,
might include china painting, whittling, etc.
