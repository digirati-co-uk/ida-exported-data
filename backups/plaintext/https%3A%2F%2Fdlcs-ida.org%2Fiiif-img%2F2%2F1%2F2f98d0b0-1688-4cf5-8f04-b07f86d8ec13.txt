EASTERN NAVAJO SCHOOLCrown Point, N. M.Annual Report----- 1933--1934." thel bor, Art Teacher.ARTB. valuate Curriculum.1. Favorable Side: orfers large varilty of material fromhotelahto chooso.II. Dofoota:Some work to hard for the class.Too muah busy work under Art.III. Bencomenda tions: Personally, I do bot feel prepared tooriticizo trt standards, so I think itwould be better to accept some good,standard Art course that includes theessential principle of art expression, suchas colbr, balance, proportion, rhythm,harmony, and form, --and then ad just thomto our problems as we need to presentthem to the Nava jo child to meet hoslife needs and adjustments.14. Materials unsuit, I did not teach art to the A- B- C levels, buted to level as some of the material seems too hard to me.in curriculu,. Also some seems more like busy work material.Transparencies.Marbledpaper.Books and Portfolios.Decorated boxes.Decorating trays.Coat hangers.Vases.Ash trays.Dolls.Needle gases.Puppets.Towels.Costumes for drama tizaion.Bolts and weaoing.of course some A classes might be older, butI am thinking of an average age child inkindergarten.The other levels do not have too difficult work,but some would belong more to class room than toArt.V. SuggestionsIt seems to me that a crafts class would answerthe needs more than an art class.This could include needle work, weaving, wooddecorating, knitting, macrame, carving, pottery,might include china painting, whittling, etc.
