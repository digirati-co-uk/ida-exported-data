health play, entitled," Saving San Lita". The ninth grade was
awarded second prize by the Junior Red Cross for an essay on
the subject," What I can do to improve my reservation when I
go home". The Red Cross authorities stated that this essay
would have drawn first prize had it not been against their rule
to award more than one first prize to any school.
Near the end of the school term declamation contests as
usual were participated in by the girls of the eighth grade
and the boys of the same. Irma Marmon, a Laguna girl, won
the silver cup in the girls' contest, and Thomas Gorman, a
Navajo boy, won the cup in the boys' contest. Miss Hendricks,
teacher in the fifth grade, as a health program, conducted a
contest in fly swatting. Two hundred thirty thousand flies
were killed by her class.
At a county display of farm, garden, poultry and domestic
science products, our school won a number of prizes in each class.
An extensive, and what we believed to be, a very attractive ex
hibit of class room work, Navajo blankets from the weaving room,
articles from the various shops and from the sewing and art de
partments, were sent to Washington and displayed at the N. E. A.
These articles supplemented by others, were forwarded to
Philadelphia for display during the sesqui- centennial.
The year' s work has been satisfactory, generally speaking,
notwithstanding the fact that the position of Principal of Home
Economics was vacant during the entire year and many other po
