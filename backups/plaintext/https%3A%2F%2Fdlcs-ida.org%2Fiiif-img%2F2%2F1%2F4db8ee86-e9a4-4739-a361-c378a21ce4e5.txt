6- Hopibuildings, equipment and water to do their work as it should bedone. If the Keams Canyon plant can not be doubled then it shouldbe rounded out and completed in both buildings and equipment toproperly care for the attendance it has. This would probably meanand expenditure of$ 163,000.00, for we need another school building,a gymnasium, employees' quarters, central heating plant, severalcottages, additional dormitory space, sewing room septic tank,additional water storage, equipment for new buildings, lockers, etc.We have never had funds enough to complete our equipment or to houseour employees properly, though making, generally, one dollar do thework of three.To put the physical plants of the day schools in properand efficient condition it would take an estimated cost as follows:Polacca$ 13,000; Toreva$ 13,500; Chimopovy$ 7,000; Oraibi$ 18,500;Hotevilla$ 8,300. The se amounts include the following things:Fencing grounds, equipment for schoolrooms, electric plants, sewerage, heating plants, school and shop buildings, employees' quarters,motion- picture machines, laundry equipment, baths and toilets,teachers quarters, etc.A very great need, handicapping us for years, has beenmet here this year. Through the co- operation of the IrrigationService people we have more than doubled the water capacity at theKeams Canyon Boarding School.There is the very best of relations existing betweenour Indian schools and nearby public school officials, and thesuperintendent of the public schools of the county visits ourreservation at least twice every year and selects our public- schoolteachers.We still need school- room and shop equipment at theBoarding School here very badly.We had to turn away many children the past year- openingon the opening day with 30 more than our capacity and with a fullregular program. It was a very successful school year here.This year was the first year this boarding school graduated a class- the first year this Navajo school had the sixth grade.All members of the class- 8 boys and 7 girls passed and weregraduated.We have worked hard toenroll all children of school age
