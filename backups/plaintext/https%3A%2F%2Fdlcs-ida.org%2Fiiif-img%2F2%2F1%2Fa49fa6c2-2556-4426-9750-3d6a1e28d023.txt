( 12)"Other points of civilization are Gallup, New Mexico, and Winslow,Arizona, east and southwest from the Agency, distant 100 and 75 milesrespectively. To the north the desert stretches its vast wildernesswith no active jurisdiction closer than small towns in Utah; and tothe west there 18 but one administrative point( Western Navajo Agenoyat Tuba, Arizona), between Oraibi and the Grand Canon.For 100 mileseastward there is no point of control other than the Fort DefianceAgency. And in the railroad towns of the desert( Gallup, Holbrook,and Winslow), the only civilization that can be pointed out to theseIndians, it is thought there is little to impress them with an idea ofthe white man's strong moral standard. Therefore in a region so vastand soremote from the best influences it is natural for the Indiannot to clearly comprehend why his loose living, gambling, etc. shouldbe condemned.According to his own customs, the offending Indian ofthe past could buy immunity from punishment, and it is difficult tochange this idea in the Indian mind.When an offense is committed,and the offender haled to court at the Agency, his first proposal is topay(" to fix it up," as he expresses it), and the second proposal isthe complainant's wish to accept such payment.Few of them can seethe necessity for other and sterner punishment.Therefore, generally the attitude of the Indian toward white man'slaw is one of protest.It would seem that in the matter of anyoffense, the method of the past was to settle things by bribes and" much talk."
