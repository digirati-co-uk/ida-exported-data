strange that you did not inform me when you were awarded the contract,
or give me some directions in regard to buy ing; I think you have no
Cause for complaint, under the circumstances. I did the best I could for
I want to say in regard to Maximilian Knodtt, that during part of
last year, from about what Jamuary to May, he furnished meat for the school
yola
for Mr.Yrisseri, on his sub- contract; he contimally furnished meat that
was not good; he repeatedly furnished fore- quarter entirely, men the cott
tract called for fore and hind- quatter, in proportion; he would seldom
cut off the shank: much of the meat that he offered was rejected, and I
continually had trouble to get meat that was fit to eat; on the first of
May, he refused to deliver any more meat with- out giving Mr. Yrisarri 10
tice that he intendend to quit delivering. On receipt of your telegram
of the 20th, inst. I went to him and ordered meat as you requested; on
the third delivery, he brought fore- quarter, when he should have brought
hini quarter. His past actions convino. ne that he doos not intend to
deliver meat according to contract, 11 he can avoid it. I shall deal
fairly and honorably with him, but I will not receive most that is unfit
to eat; I shall expect him to furnish most accord ing to contrast.
Very respectfully
leur
superintendent.
