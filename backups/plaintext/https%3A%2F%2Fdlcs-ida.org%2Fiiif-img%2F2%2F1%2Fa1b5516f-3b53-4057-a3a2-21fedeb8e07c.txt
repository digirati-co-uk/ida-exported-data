1512- Koster.strange that you did not inform me when you were awarded the contract,or give me some directions in regard to buy ing; I think you have noCause for complaint, under the circumstances. I did the best I could forI want to say in regard to Maximilian Knodtt, that during part oflast year, from about what Jamuary to May, he furnished meat for the schoolyolafor Mr.Yrisseri, on his sub- contract; he contimally furnished meat thatwas not good; he repeatedly furnished fore- quarter entirely, men the cotttract called for fore and hind- quatter, in proportion; he would seldomcut off the shank: much of the meat that he offered was rejected, and Icontinually had trouble to get meat that was fit to eat; on the first ofMay, he refused to deliver any more meat with- out giving Mr. Yrisarri 10tice that he intendend to quit delivering. On receipt of your telegramof the 20th, inst. I went to him and ordered meat as you requested; onthe third delivery, he brought fore- quarter, when he should have broughthini quarter. His past actions convino. ne that he doos not intend todeliver meat according to contract, 11 he can avoid it. I shall dealfairly and honorably with him, but I will not receive most that is unfitto eat; I shall expect him to furnish most accord ing to contrast.Very respectfullyleursuperintendent.
