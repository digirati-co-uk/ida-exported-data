Section IV--- Industries
( 12)
The Indians of this reservation, in my Judgment,
are not far enough advaneed to participate in agricultural fairs,
as they do not possess sufficient personal property and they
have not tealized farm products, enough, to make a display that
would create an interest. However, I hear tily approve of agri
cultural fairs and within a short time these Indians will be in
condition, under the proper supervision, to take an interest in
this step of education and civilization.
Industrial instructions, outside of the schools,
consist of agrisultural pursuits, taught by the farmers, construe
tion of fenoes, reservoirs and ditches for irrigation. Building
cabina, repairing roads and bridges and constructing telephone
1ines.
Tribal lands have not been leased. The matter,
of leasing tribal lands of the South Addition to the reservation,
is now under consideration.
