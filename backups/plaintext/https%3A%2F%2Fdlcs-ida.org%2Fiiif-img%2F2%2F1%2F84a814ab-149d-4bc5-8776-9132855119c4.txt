In regard to the figures concerning tuberculosis Inetdowe
among the Hopi Indiane, it is noticed that only 84 were examined
for those disease but that 134 ware cumined for trachown. There
figurao mro rather unintelligent to the Office for the reason that
boarding
the school children alono number in the vicinity of 140 and as in
struation, hayo begn given by the orfice to examine all the chil
drus attending school, at least this number of casos should be in
aluded in both the examinations of tuberculosis and trachoma; tur
thomore all of the Hopi children attending day school should be
examined. This brings the aumbor up to 380. The total number-
aufned should be as loost 526 and this takos 14 for granted that
Dr. Lymwalter made no examinations of reaorvation patients.
Kindly tonard
mp the annual report whioh
refer to the materia corrections made.
Vaxy truly yours,
