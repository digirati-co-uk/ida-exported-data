Industries.
On account of the war prices for all classes of stuff have
been quite high. There
is no demand for the Indian ponies however
but there are thousands of this class of worth less horses that
should disposed of for canning purposes, if a market could be found.
Sheep and cattle have done only fairly well on account of the short
range and dry year.
The wool growers received an advance of from
40 to 45 ° on their output and for most part, consignment was made
through the various traders and as yet no final returns hage been
received, but it is estimated that they will realize better than
50 ¢ per pound for the wool.
Water development is still a question of vital importance;
nothing was done during the past year to develop water by drilling
and on account of the lack of funds, it now seems that it will be
impossible to give much consideration during the coming year.
The
Indians are confronted with a loss of range which they do not own
but which they have here tofore used, but nothing has been done
that as yet has given them relief, and we cannot surmise just what
the Office will do to protect these Indians.
The plan to extend
the reservation has been blocked.

crowded out from his little range in the desert where he has been
content to plug along, asking no favors except to be given an
opportunity to make a living.
Where is the law- maker that raises
his voice in their behalf?
