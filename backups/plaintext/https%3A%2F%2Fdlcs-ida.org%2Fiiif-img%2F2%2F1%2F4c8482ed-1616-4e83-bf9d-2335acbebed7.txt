NARRATIVE SECTION
The Pueblo Agency was established with the capture of
Santa Fe by the U. S. troops in 1847, giving governmental
jurisdiction over the Pueblo Indians for a period of eighty
five years. The Santa Fe school established in 1890 has
factored in Pueblo life for more than forty years. Of the
two thousand Indians of the Northern Pueblos seventy- five
percent of those between the ages of eight and forty- five
years have attended schools for one to ten years.
The boarding school opened in September, 1890, with
an enrollment of 96, average annual enrollment of about
180 for the decade following, and 440 annually for the
thirty and three years thereafter. The at

period totals approximately$ 3, 691, 000 or seventy- five cents
per pupil per day for food, clothing, shelter, instruction,

year, with a population of 1, 990, the six
northern pueblos( Nambe without a school) have an enrollment
of 320-- 16% in day schools as compared with 14% thirty
years ago. The day schools have been a good factor in pueblo
administration and advance. In their talk of schools the
older Indians speak with interest and appreciation of day
school teachers, and particularly those whose tenure of
position among them was of three years or more
