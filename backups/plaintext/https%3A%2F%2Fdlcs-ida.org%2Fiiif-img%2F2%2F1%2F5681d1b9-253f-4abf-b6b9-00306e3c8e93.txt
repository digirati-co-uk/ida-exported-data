Annual Report 1916.
Heaith:
An epidemio of measles and soro- throat and whooping cough
prevailed among the pupils of the school with the result of one
death.
The Indians of the reservation in many cases have come
to the temporary hospital for medical treatment and attention and
as mentioned in last years report, the present dormitory for hos
pital purposes is not suited to our needs.
It seems unnecessary
to
further emphasize the necessity for the construction of a suitable
hispital for both school and agency purposes, as your Office 18
already familiar with health conditions as shown by many letters and
reports and we hope that action looking toward the construction of
this necessary building will promptly be put through, that greater
efforts can be put forth along health lines. We have no place to
isolate children with contagious or infectious diseases and it
certainly seems that with 3,000 Indians under my jurisdiction, at
least one hospital should be built with all speed. This would be
a beginning and with the establishment of other schools more facili
ties should be provided until all Indians could have the very best
medical and hospital attention.
This is the best means to combat
the influence of the medicine men.
