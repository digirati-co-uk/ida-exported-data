Presentation of KeyBy NASWOOT TSOSIEFriends, Classmates and Juniors:We, the Senior Class, are now about to confer a great favor uponyou. The lower classes have often looked upon us as having moreknowledge than any other class in school. That is because we havemade wise use of the key you see in our hands. The key came intoour possession in June, 1929. We guarded it well since then.Anything of value is always placed behind locked doors. It is sowith knowledge. No one breaks into the store- house of knowledgeand steals an education. He must do it by his own efforts. The keyis the symbol of those efforts.This key contains a secret chamber and in this chamber is a message given us by the class of 1927. Before I hand this key to theJunior Class, I shall ask them to rise and hear that message.( Reads scroll.)The president of the Class of 1932 will please come forward toreceive this key. President of the Class of 1932, it gives me greatpleasure to put into your keeping this valuable symbol. It has aidedus, the Class of 1931. May it do as much or more for you, the Classof 1932. Do not forget the message of 1927 and guard the key and inturn pass it on to the class of 1933.
