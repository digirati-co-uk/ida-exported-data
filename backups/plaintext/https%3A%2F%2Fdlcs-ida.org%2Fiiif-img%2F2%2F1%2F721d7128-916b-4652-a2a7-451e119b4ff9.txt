Annual Report, 1917
Pueblo Bonito School.
An average of 158 pupils was e maintained throughout the
school
year.
It would have been possible for us to have taken
care of at lease 30 more girls if the hospital building had been
constructed.
A girls' Industrial Building was completed which
is the only building provided during the year.
It has been pro
posed that this school be arranged to accomodate 300 children,
but the Indian office failed to provide plans and let contract
for the construction of a central dining hall, a larger school
and assembly building and there is no nossible chance to increase
our attendance during this fiscal year or until proper facilities
are provided to take care of the increased enrollment.
At Pinedale, 25 miles from this school, a day school
plant has been constructed and was opened up to pupils on March
10th, with an average attendance of 22 pupils. It is with great
difficulty that we are able to keep up the attendance on account
of the great distance most of the pupils have to come.
The work of the office has greatly increased and the
present force of two clerks is not sufficient to properly and
promptly take care of the necessary routine work, and your office
should give consideration to the establishment of a stenographic
position.
The liquor traffic among the Indians has materially
increased and in their efforts to secure whiskey a good nany
herds of sheep, horses and cattle have diminished and the proceeds
spent for booze.
