UNITED STATES OF ERIC,37the Indian title to whichWas ex tinguislied, was irrigable, under ditch, 40 or 50 yearsagoA. No, I don' t think I stated that definitely. I said we didnot know. Well, yes, that it was irrigable; not necessaryirrigated.Q. And has continued so down to the present time? Inother words that it is now cultivatedas shown by this tabulation.A. Yes,Q.Considered as such land under ditch and irrigable, butnot actually cultivated, what, in your opinion, would be thepresen* alue of that land percre e, and not as of40 years ago?Mr Fraser: Isn' t that all shown in the table and in thereport; unless the Governor' s opinion differs from these papers.A. I should think I would rather refer to our report. Itis almost impossible to make aMr Fahy: I think, if thereis an objection to the question,it might be stated.Mr Fraser: If you wish me to make a formal objection, itis not the best evidence. I object to the question as askingfor something that is not the best evidence, because the answer has already been reduced to documentary form in thereport and table already in evidence.MrHagerman: It is very difficult to answer the questionbecause there are so many different classes of land thatmight be grouped as irrigable; but if asked the general valueof irrigable land in that Pueblo thatis not now irrigated, Iwould say around$ 25 an acre.Mr. Fraser: Thatis not nowirrigated?Mr. Hagerman: If it is irrigable. It may be, that is under ditch and susceptible of immediate irrigation by the pres.ent ditches.Mr. Fahy: I would like to clear the method used by theBoard at arriving at the$ 35 per acre. You-- as I understoodyou to testify this morning â€” fixed upon that as the Board' sopinion of the value as of some approximating 40 or 5N yearsago. Is that rorrect?
