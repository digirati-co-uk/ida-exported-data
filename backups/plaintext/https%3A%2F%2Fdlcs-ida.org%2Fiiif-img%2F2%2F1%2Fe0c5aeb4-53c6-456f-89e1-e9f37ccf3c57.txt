KONVDNZDZO CVETJENIThe Boy Scouts of this school have taken an active part in a numberof Community Welfare enterprises.When the Red Cross recently called for clothing for the flood sufferers of the Ohio Valley our Scouts were active in distributing literature,and in collecting and sorting clothing.A few years ago our Scouts dug holes and planted trees on the University grounds. These trees are doing fine and we are proud of them.At Christmas time the Scouts collect old toys, and take them to thefire department. The firemen repair and repaint them and act as SantaClaus to the poor children.The First Aid Contest is of great importance every spring.In 1936 our troop won the District First Aid Contest. They wereproud of the silver cup that they received.We plan to have a camp about the first of May this spring. Indianboys enjoy camping. Scouting teaches them to love and enjoy the greatout- of- doors.Scouting teaches them to love and enjoy the great out- of- doors.Any activity that gives zest to life, and at the same time strengthenscharacter is well worth while.
