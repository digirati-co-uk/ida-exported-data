THE HOPI INDIANS
Noon Camp, Canyon
de Chelly
The Hopi Indians
now number
about 1000.
They
are a peaceful
, kindly folk inhabiting
seven
“ Sky Cities, ” loftily perched
on three
mesas pro
jecting
into the Painted
Desert, 142 miles northwest
of Gallup
. The Hopis are industrious
, thrifty
ord
erly, and mirthful. A round
of ceremonies
, each
terminating
in the pageants
called dances
, mark the
different
seasons
of the year. The Katchina
, or
mask dance, is an elaborate
ceremony
, exceedingly
grotesque. The Flute Dance
is ideally poetic, and
the Snake
Dance, held the latter
part of August
, is
intensely dramatic.
The peculiar attractions
which
the Hopis offer to students
of primitive
community
and pagan subjects, or the casual traveler
hoping
to find a new sensation
, draw an increasing
number
of visitors every year at the time of their festivities
.
CHACO
CANYON
Ninety- two miles from Gallup
is Chaco Canyon
. Its sheer, but sometimes
crumbling
, walls of red sandstone
rise from 100 feet to a height
nearly equal to the United
States Capital
Dome. Within an area half that of the District of Columbia
are eighteen
enormous
community
houses, having
100 to 800 or more rooms
,
These ancient
ruins
are now being excavated by the National
Geographic
Society.
