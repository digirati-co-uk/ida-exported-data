ADDRESS REPLY TOTHE ATTORNEY GENERALAND REFER TOINITIALS AND NUMBERJWG HGDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICEWASHINGTON, D. C.210663October 10, 1929.Georg• A, H, Fraser, Beq.,Spooial Assistant to the Attorney General,Blatt Building,Santa Fe, New Mexi ooSirReference is made to your letter of October 4, 1929, requesting anthority to employ a reporter for the purpose of reporting the case of United States,as Guardian of the Pueblo of Islata vs Berboa, et al, and two other cases.The Department will authorise the employment of a reporter in these cases,bat, before doing so, desires to be advised why the reporter so engaged aholdbe allowed traveling expenses and a per diem in lied of subsistence. It isassumed that you will endeavor to Seoure the pervioes of a reporter who residesat the place of trial, and thus avoid the inorrenoe of any spense of traveland subsistence. It would seem that the serviоes of reporters would be available at either Albuquerque or Santa Fe, asasang that the ones will be triedat one of said placesEven if you were unable to secure the serviоes of a reporter residing atthe place of trial, it is possible that the bid of one reporter residing elsewhere might be lower than another by reason of a lower charge for subsistenceThe usual per diem of$ 6. 00 in lieu of subsistenos is tied for Governmentoffiore, and does not necessarily apply to contract serviоes in conneotionwith the reporting of oases. In other words, it is possible that one reporternight be willing to aооept a per diem of 4. 00 in 1ion of subsistenos ratherthan a per diem of$ 6. 00 in lieu of subsistenos, and thus be the lowest bidder,no thwithstanding the foot that the per diem and folio rates might be the sameUpon receipt of your reply, the matter will be given further consideration.Respeotally,Charles P. Siason,Assistant Attorney General
