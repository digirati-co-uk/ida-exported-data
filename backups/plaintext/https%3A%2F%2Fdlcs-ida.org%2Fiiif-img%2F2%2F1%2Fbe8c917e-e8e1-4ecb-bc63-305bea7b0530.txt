CONSTRUCTION
:
On taking
charge
of the Moqui Indian
Reservation
the present
super intendent
was amazed
to note the condition
of buildings
and the appalling
lack of quarters
and school
and shop space. Beginning
with 1912 continued
effort
was directed
toward
curing
this situation
. At this writing
( March 1919) the building
plans have by no means reached
a point where the reservation
and its
departments
may be considered
as finished
.
Under the SCHOOLS Section
will be noted
those buildings
that, in the opinion
of
Supervisor
Lipps, should
be erected
if the five large day schools are to present
efficiency
, and if it is ever expected
to retain
satisfied
employees
at day school
work.
Since 1912 twenty
- six buildings
have been constructed
in the open market, as follows
