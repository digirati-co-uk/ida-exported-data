caught Indians in the act of distilling whiskey and making
wine. There seems to be no remedy for this except by an in

the Indians are involved. This differentiation is not evident
in the cases we have had to date.

Prohibition Department, but have not received any assistance
from the State authorities and the help that the Federal authorities
can give us is not sufficient to cope with the situation;
The Indians do not purchase proprietary medicines for bever
age purposes' primarily because it is not necessary as they can
secure bootleg whiskey sufficient for their needs.
