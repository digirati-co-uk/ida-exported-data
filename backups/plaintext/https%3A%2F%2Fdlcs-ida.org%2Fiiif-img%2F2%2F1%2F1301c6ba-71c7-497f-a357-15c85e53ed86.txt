There is an item of$ 12, 000. 00 in the appropriation bill
for the fiscal year 1917, for the purchase of additional land
for farming purposes. The land is greatly needed and will
enable us to do more in farming. As soon as the purchase is
made and the farm is developed so most of the forage required
can be raised, it is proposed to purchase a better grade of
cattle combining dairy and beef qualities. The male calves
can be sold to the Indians to improve their herds. It is al
so proposed to raise a few sheep of the proper type for cros
sing with the Indian sheep, selling the malekambs to the In
dians to improve their flocks.
