My dear kr. Maddene
I am in receipt of your kind favor of
the 27th.
inst but it did not come in tine to stop the going at the piano.
I told wrs Cross that if she would wait a few days
I would send the
9
things to her by the school team at no cost but she insisted
upon
having the piano at once, and so had it hauled at her own exponse,
The other things are here yet cut we will deliver them to Mr. Crpss be
fore
we go away.
I am very thankful for your kind expression of confi
dence. The way the people of Santa Fe have received the news of my
dismissal
ity pleasant to me. Almost every
business
and profes
sonal man in the town has written strong personal letters to various
senators and the Secretary of the Interim has been just showered with
protuits.
i inclose in this my persona check for$ 3 in full of rent of
piano for the month of January
With the best wishes and kindest
regards to you all I am most truly yo 73
