o Erefully selected books
This is an important agenoy in the
education of Indians and lasting good results by teaching boys
and girls the significance of a 1ibrary and intelligent
me thods in the consultation of books, Every grade visits
the library during a schedule of hours each week, and the
teacher and librarian give individual instruction and help
Important classroom work is looked up, current even te
sought from reliable magazines, newspapers and other sources,
debates prepared and original study in many subjects pursued
It is encouraging that a large percentage of the reading is
of a solid and serious nature
The books of fio tion have
been selected with due regard to the improvement men tally and
morally of the student. Aside from the compulsory library
work, extensive use of its advantages is made by students
during their spare time
Information and pleasure is likewise derived from
the reading rooms in each of the dormitories, which are stocked
with the best magazines and daily newspapers
By all these
me ans habits of study are cultivated, good reading is foe tered
and the way paved, by constant repetition during youth, for a
proper use of spare and evening time when these young people
leave school. Such training is invaluable for the 11fe on the
re Servations or other sparsely settled dio tricts of the West
