Most of our schools are equipped with playground apparatus
and it is being used under supervision where it is in a state
of repair that will justify its use. The equipment is badly
worn in some cases and repair parts apparently cannot be
secured. The boys and girls of the day schools are approxi
mately the same age, most of them under 12, therefore, they
use the same playground and the same equipment to a very great
extent.
It does not seem possible at this time to make any reason
able estimate as to the length of time it will be necessary for
the Government to maintain schools for the Indians of this state.
The Pueblo people are a peculiar problem and have been so since
the United States acquired this territory from Mexico. The
status of the Indian citizen in the state of New Mexico will
have to be further defined by Federal statutes and amendments
to the State Constitution before there can be any reasonable
hope of placing the schools wholly under the jurisdiction of
the states.
