REMARKS.
FIELD MATRON'S.
Jolie A. Palin; female; field matron; salary
$ 720.00 per year; she is field matron at Zuni Pueblo, she
was transferred from Fort Apache, Arizona to that Pueblo
by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
Mary Y. Rodgers; female; field matron; salary
$ 720.00 per year; she is field matron at Acoma Pueblo;
she was sent there by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
They were instructed to report to the superin
tendent of the Alburquerque school; at the time of my
inspection of that school they had not reported for duty,
Mr. Holland then action acting superintendent or myself
did not know they had been appointed; I did not think it
worth while to spend the time and money to visit them at
this time, as it would take several days; Zuni is 40 miles
from the rail road, and Acoma 25 miles from the rail road.
