Dear sir!
Replying to your inquiry as to price at which I will
rent the spring lot to the Government for purpose of taking
water therefrom in manner previously mentioned by you, with the
privilege of purchasing thereafter.
Putting the lot to such use as you desire will necessitate
the creation of a considerable excavation for the collection of
water for heavy or urgent cases such as fire protection and irri
gation; the probable dumping on the lot of the coarse gravels
brought up; the removal of several choice fmit trees; and the
death of several more from neglect of irrigation; the cutting of
fences to accommodate your needs; removal of the place from pri
vate sÄ…le; and the loss of its use for gardening or building
purposes
Should the Government fail to purchase, these changes
would cause a damage that no fair rental would repay.
Still,
feeling that once using the water supply, the Government would
never abandon it,
I will, with a reasonable assurance of future
purchase by the Government, lease it to your Department at$ 80,00
per year for two or four years, with the privelige of buying at
its fair value at any time prior to the expiration of the lease.
