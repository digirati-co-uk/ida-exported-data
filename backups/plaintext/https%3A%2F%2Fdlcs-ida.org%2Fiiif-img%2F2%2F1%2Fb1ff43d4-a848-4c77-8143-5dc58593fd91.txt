In it she said:" Wingfoot is forcibly taken awayfrom his parents to school by the policeman. Tht evening the children get intoline for flag salute, and the disciplinarian without any instructions or patienceforces Wing foot to salute the flag and whips him cruelly, which is not done atany Indian school. Wingfoot and Corn Blossom, the Pueblo girl, grow up, andaf' er they have finished at Sherman Institute, Corn Blossom receives a telegramfrom her father saving that her mother is very ill, but instead they want to gether away from the Navajo boy to marry an uneducated Pueblo man twice her age.She reaches home and they gie hevr her Indian clothes to wear instead of he clothesshe has on. This you all know that our Indian people do not do, as they send usto school to learn the white man' s ways and to practice whatwe have l' arned, athome..... Wingfoot, too, goes home, but his father refuses to greet him because he is wearing white men' s clothes, and this you know is not true, also. Wingfoot discovers oil in his coun' ry. He tells the Pueblos that he will give them halfof the oil wealth if they will let him have Corn Blossom for his wife. ”The most important event on the Dramatic Club calendar was the Commencement program, given in honor of the Alumni.
