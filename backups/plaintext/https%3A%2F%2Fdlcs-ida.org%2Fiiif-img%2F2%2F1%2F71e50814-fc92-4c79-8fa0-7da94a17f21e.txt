Commends Seniors
Christian E. Oberholser
Along with all the responsibilities that
go along with being a senior also goes
the honor and prestige. Your senior
class has done an honorable job in
fulfilling your responsibilities to the
school and to yourself. You did it with
class and I am proud of you.
I' ve met and worked with your officers
and advisors. You always dealt with
problems on a positive basis and
worked toward solutions. Santa Fe In
dian School is and can only be as
great as its students. You' ve set an
excellent example for other senior
classes to follow.
Joseph Abeyta, Santa Fe and Albuquerque Indian Schools Superintendent
I' m sure you will remember S. F. I. S. al
ways and we will remember you.
Good Luck

Superintendent' s
Message
As future leaders of the Indian Com
munity, your class, the Class of' 81,
has established a strong educational
foundation for you to build upon and a
strong tradition of leadership and per
severance for future classes to follow.
You have fought the good fight and
can now reap the rewards... and the
responsibilities.
You must now go forward in your indi
vidual endeavors to bring to fruition
that seed of hope for Indian self- deter
mination and pride that was planted
with so much stress and effort by the
All Indian Pueblo Council, by the
School Board and Administrators, by
your instructors and, not least of all,
by you. You have earned the respect
and affection of your people.
My congratulations to you on your
successes, and my best wishes in re
gard to your personal goals.
Joseph Abeyta
You' ve completed the high school
education our great Lord and great
Spirit gave you.
Education has no ending, continue to
learn.
Take the right road to success,
not the wrong road to disaster.
The ceremonies come, drums beat.
Never leave your Indian way of life.
Be proud you are a Native American
Indian.
Your parents, Tribal Leaders, your
children, children to come, have respect
and love them.
Some day, you will become a leader in
your respective reservation.
