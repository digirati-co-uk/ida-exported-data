As time goes on we realizethat we will never be left alone. With cultures so similar it' shard not to grow together as one.With our generation we hope to bring our cultures aliveagain. We want to bring hope back into the hearts of allNative people. Success is in the hearts and minds of all NativeAmericans. We just need to search and find it.Thank you S. F. I.
