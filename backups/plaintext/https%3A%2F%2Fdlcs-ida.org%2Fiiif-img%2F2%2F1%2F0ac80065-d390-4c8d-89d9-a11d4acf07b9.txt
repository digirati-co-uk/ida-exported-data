p Page 9.NARRATIVE.Seotinn IV.Ladustrios.Annual Roport,1911.Pueblo Bonito Indian School,The Indians, with the assistano. of the throo Stookmen,are constructing rolervoirs, and other work is being done in protootion of" geop" springs with the view better to cONBOrvo water.Improvements usually found on allotmonts are corrals, hogw8, stookades, and a very few log md stone houses.The hogansare biroular and dome- shaped, with an entrance on the east and anoponing in the dome for the smoke to escape, This arrangement affords good ventilation.Those Indians depend ohiefly upon their hords of sheep andgoats for their living, of whioh thoy had, according to the last8028on's dipping record, 123,544 head. As the majority of theseIndians have been induced to run separate buok herds, 80 es tohave lambs come after the cold weather has passed, the saving ofa larger percentage of the inor ease has been effooted. Along withthis move is the improvemont of their stook. The more wealthy Indians, who do not have to depend upon blanket- weaving for a living,are grading up their sheep by purohasing a good grade of merinos,and so increase the quality and quantity of the output for themarket.It is certain that merino wool for blanket- making is notequal to the coarse, greaseless wool of the straight Navajo sheep.The blanket- makers, who depend largely upon this industry for aliving, require a coarse wool strain. No improvement in thecoar se- wool sheep is noted at this time.Specialized stock improvement should be made a feature ofthe school to be established here, and to this end we are directing our efforts.
