These schools should be built so that they can be converted into day schools when a sufficient number of Indiansestablish a permanent home in the locality.The capacity of the three boarding schools should beincreased so as to accomodate two hundred and fifty morepupils. With ten small boarding schools and by increasing thecapacity of the three boarding schools and transferring olderpupils to suitable nonreservation schools the majority of thechildren of school age will be provided for. The schoolshave done excellent work during the current year.The day school recently opened at the Cornfields with anenrollment of twenty four and an average attendance of twentytwo is doing excellent work and I believe it will be a success.The Mission School located at St. Michaels nine milesfrom Fort Defiance and conducted by the Sisters of the BlessedSacrament, is doing excellent work.9- HKS- 13
