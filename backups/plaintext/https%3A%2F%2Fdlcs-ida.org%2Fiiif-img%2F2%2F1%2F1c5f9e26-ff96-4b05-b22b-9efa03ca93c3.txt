Albuquerque Training SchoolAlbuquerque, New Mexico.June 30, 1921.NARRATIVESection 2.--------------- Health.The health of the pupils was very good until the lastof January when a sudden outbreak of measles occurred.During the winter, notwithstanding the fact that it was anunusually fine, open one, much sickness prevailed in thecity of Albuquerque and this vicinity. Measles, whoopingandcough, diphtheria were the epidemic diseases in districtscontiguous to the school since the summer of 1920.. Weescaped the whooping cough and diphtheria but measles invaded the school and 65 pupils contracted it. An epidemic ofmeasles in an Indian school is a thing to be much dreaded.Due to good care with prompt hospitalization of infectedpupils all recovered from the measles and eight from slightbronchopneumonia following the measles. Tuberculosis, however, that so frequently follows in the wake of epidemicdiseases, came on in its galloping form and resulted in theredeath of three of our pupils-- the greatest number ofdeaths during any school year since the session of 1911- 12when an epidemic of the same disease resulted in three deaths.
