.......... School.
Mrs. Isis Harrington, Principal, thirteen classroom teachers
and one music teacher have had charge of the academic department
of the school. The department is well organized, the students
properly graded, and the work has been quite satisfactory. No
teacher in the academic work in this school should be rated be
low" good". The course of study has been followed closely with
good results. Beginning October 1, study four was conducted
from 7 to 8, three times a week for students in the third to
sixth grades, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, while
the students of higher grades studied in the study rooms from 7
to 9: 30 under supervision.
On Thursday evening, twice a month, the eight literary soci.
eties met. Industrial organizations for boys and music and other
clubs for girls occupied the other two Thursday evenings during
each month. These societies and clubs were presided over by pu
rooms
pils with a teacher present at each in the capacity of advisor.
Those taking an active part in the work of these organizations
have developed confidence, received valuable training in thought
and speaking, and improved in composition work and English.
Out of an enrollment of 838, thirty- four pupils were weak
in some one or more branches and were required to remain at the
school to attend the six weeks summer classes. The summer school
has enabled students, weak in some subjects to continue with
their grades without taking a grade over.
The seventh grade won a Junior Red Cross prize by writing a
17.
