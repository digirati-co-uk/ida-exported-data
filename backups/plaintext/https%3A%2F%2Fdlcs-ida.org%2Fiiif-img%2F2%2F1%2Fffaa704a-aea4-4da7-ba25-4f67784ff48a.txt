Health.
When the epidemic of Influenza swept over the
Univea staves our School and Reservation was seriously
effected, and during October and November of last year
there were many cases. At one time here in the school
more than 100 cases existed at one time with one- half of
the employees also effected. Five of the school childred
died. Later on in December five of our school boys died
near Garden City, Kansas, where they were employed in the
beet fields. At least half of the Indians living upon the
public domain contracted this disease, and our estimate from
best information obtainable is that live hundred Indians of
all ages died from this epidemic. Seve ral cases of smallpox.
have been reported the past year, but vaccination of many
Indians by the Agency Physician has held this disease in check.
There was also several cases of diphtheria, but the use of
dintheria anti- toxin produced good results in nearly every case.
