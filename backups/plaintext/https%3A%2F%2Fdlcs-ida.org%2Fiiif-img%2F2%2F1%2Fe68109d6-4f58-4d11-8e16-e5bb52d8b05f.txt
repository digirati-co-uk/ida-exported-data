SECTION IV. Education
,
A. Sanatorium
School. The employment
of two elementary
teachers regularly
at the Sanatorium
provides
these children
with their primary work while eur
ing their tuberculosis
, and prepares them for transfer
to the Mission School
at the proper time. The restricted
means they have at their command and the
nocessary
confinement
of the children
in bed makos this work alor and dirti
cult, but fairly satisfactory
results are obtained
. The grados taught aro
Primary to Fourth.
WS
B. Mission School. This school is operated
in co- operation
with th. Roformed Church Mission
. The Govornmont

the food, clothing, sohool supplies
, fuel, and one teacher. The rest of the personnel
and the plant is provided
by the Mission Board. Primary through
oighth grado is taught, Domestic
Science and Health and Hygeine offered the older girls. The majority of the childron
are transfers
from the Sanatorium
, although
there are some childron
who are
taken directly
from the roservation
as medical examination
shows them not to be in nood of Sanatorium
care. Wo roceive
a remarkable
degree of cooperation
from this institution
and consider that they aro going fino work.

Schools. There are about 14 of our young peoplo non attend. ing non- rodorvation
schools, at Albuquerque

a program of inspiring
as
many young people as possible to take advantage
of those opportunities
