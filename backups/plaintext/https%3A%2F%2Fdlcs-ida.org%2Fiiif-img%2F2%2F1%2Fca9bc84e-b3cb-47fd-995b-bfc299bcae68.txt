We decided that the most important work for this morn
in was to work on the skins. We scraped the paste from them,
and then we washed them as well as we could with the tubs and
equipment we had at hand. When we had them washed, we stretched
and nailed them on the boards. They needed to be dry, before
we could work on them any more. We put sawdust on other skins
So we could start tanning some more of them.
The girls mixed some clay with water to get it ready
for painting. We need to search for different colors before
we can work much more with it.
We were having such a sandstorm that it madeiit diffi
cult to get much accomplished. Leonard stained another one
of the Bulletin Boards.

We continued to work on the skins.
Our next step was to
stretch and pull the hides with the hands until they were soft.
We found this very hard to do, and I believe we let them get too
dry, before we started to work on them. Wilson said," This
is as soft as a feather." It didn't feel quite that soft to me.
Harry suggested when he came in this morning," Let's
go writing something, and sit on the floor." Marcelino," I
am going to paint this board." He stained the folding writ
ing desk that we had made for a sample of something we might
use to write on, if we were sitting on the floor.
We dis
cussed our work on the skins, then we wrote a class story
which the children called," Our Hogan Skins." Then the
children wrote individual stories.
