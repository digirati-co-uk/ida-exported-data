0April 2,We decided that the most important work for this mornin was to work on the skins. We scraped the paste from them,and then we washed them as well as we could with the tubs andequipment we had at hand. When we had them washed, we stretchedand nailed them on the boards. They needed to be dry, beforewe could work on them any more. We put sawdust on other skinsSo we could start tanning some more of them.The girls mixed some clay with water to get it readyfor painting. We need to search for different colors beforewe can work much more with it.We were having such a sandstorm that it madeiit difficult to get much accomplished. Leonard stained another oneof the Bulletin Boards.April 3,We continued to work on the skins.Our next step was tostretch and pull the hides with the hands until they were soft.We found this very hard to do, and I believe we let them get toodry, before we started to work on them. Wilson said," Thisis as soft as a feather." It didn't feel quite that soft to me.Harry suggested when he came in this morning," Let'sgo writing something, and sit on the floor." Marcelino," Iam going to paint this board." He stained the folding writing desk that we had made for a sample of something we mightuse to write on, if we were sitting on the floor.We discussed our work on the skins, then we wrote a class storywhich the children called," Our Hogan Skins." Then thechildren wrote individual stories.
