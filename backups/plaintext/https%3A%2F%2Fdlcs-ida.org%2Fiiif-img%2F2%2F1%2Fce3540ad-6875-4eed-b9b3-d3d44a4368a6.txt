The team' s strength was not only on being in shape, but
having knowledge of the game. The coaches taught the girls new
rules and regulations, and the offense, defense, coverage, and the
transition of the game.
" There' s a lot more to volleyball that meets the eye," said Coach
Seath Chavez.
The highlight of the season would have to be the district match
against McCurdy. Although the Lady Braves didn' t win the game,
Coach Chavez commented," That was the best game they played
all season. It was a marathon match that lasted 2 1/ 2 hours and
went through five close games."

Losing in the regional tournament was hard for everyone." The

said Coach Chavez," until I started working on next year' s line
up. The future of Santa Fe Indian School Volleyball looks better

" I was happy that we had a winning season," she added." We
finished of the season 14- 9."
Coach Seatha truly believes every year the team get stronger and
stronger, and looking at next year' s returnees, that seems to hold
true.
