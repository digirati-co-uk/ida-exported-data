THE OUTING SYSTEM TRAINS IN INDUSTRY AND CIVILIZATION,
One of the features of the Carlisle Indian School
which has attracted favorable attention among educators and the
public is the" outing system," Organized almost coincident with
the founding of the Johool, it has been the means of affording
training in civilization and industry to hundreds of young men
and women of Indian blood.
The success of this system of cooperative education
has been received with such universal endorsement as to insure
an extension of the plan elsewhere. In the larger Indian schools
of the country it has been introduced in a more or less ex
tended me asure and with varying results, depending on the care,
energy, foresight, adaptation to the condi tions in the locality
of the school, and the continuity and organized effort with
which the entire work has been handled. While in a large
measure depending on the sympathy and conscience of the patrons,
called country" father" and" nother" by the Carlisle students
the outing system is also dependant on a careful delection of
the patrons, a study of the needs and disposition of the stu
dent, follow- up reports, regular attendance at public school
and intelligent supervision by the outing agent and the school
authorities. With such safeguards it should prove more success.

education has been raised to high standards for all classes
