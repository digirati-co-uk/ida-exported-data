Hon. J. McI.--- 2.great deal of property, in this county in as much as the depredationsofthese Indians have so greatly impoverishedmany settlers that they havebeen compelled to relinquish their holdings and abandon stock raising.We further certify that a very large percentageof the taxesof this county is borne by the stock interest, which in turn is dependentsolely upon such range privileges as have been built up and made available at great labor and cost.On the other hand, we have not been enabled to tax Indian stock, within the limits of this county, though manymiles from any reservation, and so managed as to exclude many thousanddollars worth of property that would otherwise have yielded a publicrevenue.We ask that you make such report of this matter to the Government as will in your judgment tend to secure action relieving ourcitizens from this unjust and oppressive burden, believing that theGovernment only deeds to be apprised of the real situation to deal withentire fairness with all parties concerned in this matter.Respectfully submittedChairmanis a lachMembers BoardCocomio komity.Hazudhaof Infernsonof
