SECTION IIHEALTH:General health conditions over the entirereservation, school and egency, have been exceptionallygood during the year. There have been no epidemics orinfectious and contagious diseases brought to our knowledge,and it is hoped that with the appointment of the field nurse,the position for which has already been established, agreat deal can be accomplished among Reservation Indianswith regard to health and sanitation.The general sanitary conditions of the reservation,especially in and around Indian homes, are not good.Living as the se Indians do, it is very difficult for themto practice sanitation as we see it. This difficultybeing due to the serious shortage of water, as well asthe fact that it is impossible for the Indians tomaintain a permanent home. Our Indians are realizingmore each year the good that can be done them by theagency medical personnel, and it is, and must be, merelya matter of educating them to the point where they willcall upon the medical staff at the agency, rather thanthe Indian Medicine Men. But little has been accomplishedduring the year in improving sanitary conditions of theIndian homes. As above stated, it is hoped that theappointment of a field nurse will me an much to our Indiansand it will enable us to formulate and carry out a healthprogram that will be a benefit to the Reservation Indians.Additional water, which will be made available with newwells now under construction will enable many of theIndians to live under more sanitary conditions, and thisimprovement will be more noticeable as more weils areprovided.I know of no influence which operates to prevent amaximum usefullness of the local hospital. The Indiansat times call at the hospital for the purpose of obtainingsimple home remedies, such as cough me dicines, linimentand so forth, and the hospital facilities are extended tothose Reservation Indians who are in need of medical careand attention, and who are willing to place themselves inthe hospital under the care of a physician.With only one physician and no field murse to carefor the medical needs of the school, having a capacityof 400, as well as 1, 200 Reservation Indians, it has beenimpossible to accomplish but very little during the fiscalyear. This condition will exist until additional medicalpersonnel is provided. The purchase of the Cedar Springsproperty, suggests an excellent site for a health center,at which could be stationed a physician and a field nurse
