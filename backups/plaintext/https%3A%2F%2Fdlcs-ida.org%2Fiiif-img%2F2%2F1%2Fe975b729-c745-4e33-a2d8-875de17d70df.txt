Dear$ 2.13

Your kind favor of the 24th ultimo came to hand in good time,
É™n 1 I have delayed answeing it until now, in the hopes that my appli
cation to the Indian Orrice for authority to buy the engino etc., would
receive a favorable reply, but as yet no reply has come.
I am satig
fiet that the authority will be allowed, but how soon, I cannot tell.
My application included the purchase and Installment of an electrii
light plant, and as the light plans and engine etc. purchase must be
considered at the same time, there would be more delay, than were just
the enging etc., under consideration,
I have spoken to Wr, Dudrow about the hauling and I am certain
that he will haul the plant at a reasonable rat..
I have had no corres
ondence as to the electric piant, but have employed an expert to make
ans, specifications, estinato etc., Thes. I have submitted to the
ndian Office and without doubt I shall soon receive authority to ask
O bids to install the plant.
Hoping to hear from ou at an early date, and to be able to give
30me difinito information soon,
I remain very truly yours,
A.H.Vide
Superintendente
