DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
UNITED STATES INDIAN INSPECTION SERVICE,
Mescalero Indian School,
Nescalero, New Mexico.
Walter UCM. Luttrell, Superintendent.
The general condition of the buildings, both Agency and School,
at this place are better than at the time of my last inspection.
They are, however, crowded into too small space; in case a fire
should once get started, all would certainly burn.
There are a few old one story frame buildings that have been con
demned that are to be taken down, and what good material remains is to
be used in making repairs; when these old buildings are removed, the
appearance of the place will be much improved, and the liability of
fire much reduced.
There is not sufficient dormitory space to comfortably accommodate
the number of pupils now enrolled.
The girls dormitories are on the upper floor of the school build
ing, the dormitories for the larger boys are in the same building, on
the
same floor. That portion of the building now occupied by the boys
should be transferred to the girls, and the boys should have a building
by themselves.
