Annual Report- 58anta Fe Schooland Agency.braking down of the old strength and autocratic rule ofthe pueblo officials, and is the fundamental cause forthe growing sense of independonce noticable among theIndians and most marked in the younger gonoration, Thepoint in the forgoing statements is the tendency of present day conditions toward the breaking up of the puolocommunitias. The relevancy of my comment on this tondoncyto the proposed legislation of Congress, to authoriz. theacceptance of the pueblo lands in trust by the Secretaryof the Interior, is my conviction, based upon close observation of tho pueblo communities, that, during this periodof transition upon which the pueblos are now ontoring theinitial stages, the Indians nood, more than at any othorperiod in their history, the protection and guiding handof the government in the solution of the problem of theadministration of their lands, which will confront themwith incroasing disiculties during the next few years,The dÂ£vision of community land holdingsunder the most favorable auspices is fraught with more orloss danger to the individual interests, The desire fora partition of the pueblo land holdings, duo, in my opin.ion, to fundamental causes, is now Ovi dont in many instanaos among the pueblos.. Such a division or partition of thepueblo grants, which must in course of time inovitably come,unloss mad. under the direction of the govornment, couldnot be accomplished without fraud and loss to the individualIndians, It may be safely promised that this chang fromthe communal to the individual must come and is boingbrought about through aduation and general onlightmontThe community lit. will disintergrate, and in the next rowyears the publo land grants will suffer a division or par.tition into individual holdings. From tho tend today inpueblo at fairs, It is my opinion that bofore ten y oars ofthe trusteeship period would have elapsed the more progrossive of the pueblos would welcome the allotment in soveraltyof their lands,
