SECTION 10INDUSTRIES:Six farm chapters have been organized among theIndians and it is found that these organizations areof great benefit, not only for the Indians themselves,but to me in administrating the affairs of the reservation Â·and handling the industrial program. The officers ofthese various organizations are proving themselves tobe very efficient and the members of the organizationsde pe nd a great deal upon the judgment of the officers,and the latter very frequently act as spoke smen for thechapter to which they belong, and in this way much can beaccomplished by dealing with an individual re ther thana group, and the same, if not better results are obtained.It is our present plan to introduce new vegetables duringthe coming year. At the present time the main diet ofthe Indians consists of corn and mu tton. It is believedthat an addition consisting of carrots and other ve getables,to their diet, will be valuable to them from a healthstandpoint, and it is quite probable that a sufficientquantity can be produced so that they can dispose of thesurplus to the school. During the season, just pas sed,this school purchased from the Indians a considerablequantity of squash, watermelons and so forth, which productswere raised by the Indians and provided them with a smallreve mue which was used for the purchase of clothing andother necessary supplies. Much stress is being la id uponthe advantage of producing more and selling the surplusto the school in order that a cash re venue may be derivedfor the purchase of needs which cannot be produced.As previously stated, a very concentrated effort isbeing put forth to encourage more Indians to farm largerareas. The results during the past season have been mostgratifying and the present attitude of the Indians indicatethat they realize the situation with which they are confronted,in that they must reduce their flocks and depend more uponfarm and garden products for their living. The industrialprogram, as outlined, contemplates the encouragement ofour Indians on the reservation and it is believed that thiswill tend to bring those Indians who heretofore may havedone but very little toward the support of themselves andfamilies into the field of activity.The Indians are not all provided with suitableequipment and this is a matter which is receiving ourseriour consideration and attention. Purchases are beingmade from reimbursable funds of implements for their use,and it is hoped that in time we will have them all suitably
