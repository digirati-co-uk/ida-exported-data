- 4-den for each family, some trench silos, a better manner of marketing their products, and securing the cooperation of the Indians in saving more of their products for feed instead ofselling everything marke table as has been done in the past.In connection with this program, and to render assistancein carrying it out, is our local fair which has been most successfully run for two years. Plans are un der way for holding atwo days session in October and great interest has already beenaroused among the Indians to make this a permanent institution.Thus arousing competition in the raising of better farm products,better stock and the pleasure resulting from a community meeting of this nature.Stock RaisingThe sheep industry is one of the important sources of income of the Zunis. Eight years ago there were 40, 000 sheep onthe Zuni reservation but as surveys had been made showing thecarrying capacity of the range it was found that this numbermust be materially reduced. This was being worked out in a systematic manner when the storm of two years ago destroyed such alarge number of the sheep that the problem of this reduction wasthought to be solved. However, the increased lamb crop of thisyear( more than 90 per cent being counted at dipping time) hasraised the number until the maximum of 20, 000 for which we strivewill need be reached by disposal of all w√©thers and a large number of the older ewes.The goat problem at Zuni is not of great importance althoughwe are planning on reducing the number within the next year.The Zuni sheep are much better bred than those of the Navajoes as systematic introduction of pure bred Rambouillets hasbeen in progress for many years. To increase the size of thelambs and to lengthen the staple, Corriedales have been introduced for two seasons and this improvement is noticeable in theflocks. Not many years ago the average fleece was but three andone- half pounds. This has increased to five and one- half pounds,with much better quality and a better price is secured for thisimproved wool. Last year lambs were sold by weight for the firsttime, thus giving the owners with improved herds an advantagethey had never had before in securing a higher price for theirlambs and this has proven a more satisfactory manner of selling,which will be continued.
