Fun Events and Dances
Students at SFIS enjoy a number of activities
and dances throughout the year. Whether
students are reading at Arts Fest, learning
about responsibility by helping with a
campus clean- up on Community Day, having
a blast during Fun Days or just dancing the it
night away, everybody has a good time at
SFIS.
