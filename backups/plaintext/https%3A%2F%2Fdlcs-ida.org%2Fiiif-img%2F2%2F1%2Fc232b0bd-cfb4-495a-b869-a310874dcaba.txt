Sohdols.
There has been an attendance of three Navajo children
in the district school here in CrownPoint.
The classfoom instruc.
tion in the boarding school has been satisfactory.
The instruction
given in the industrial departnents, particularly that of carpenter
has been very poor and not what it should be.
The position of
blacksmith has not been filled on account of your office meking
a cut in salary so that no good workman could afford to accept,
though your office has since remedied this by increasing same.
The band under the leadership of a returned student
has furnished high class music for the various special occasions
and also filled a second engagement at the state l'air.
The farm four miles from the school was very productive
under the management of an efficient farmer and good crops were
grown and include three cuttings of alfalfa, corn enough to
fatten 15 head of hogs, vegetables which have considerable value
in adding to our bill- of- fa re.
Employees for most part have been interested in their
work and the few exceptions have worked in harmong with each
other and in the interest of the pupils individually.
