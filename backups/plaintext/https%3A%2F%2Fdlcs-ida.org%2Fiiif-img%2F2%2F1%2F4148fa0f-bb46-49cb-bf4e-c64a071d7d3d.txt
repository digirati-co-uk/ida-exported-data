The year has been a guccessful, but trying one. The pupils have
made good progress in the Academio and Industrial Departments. The
adoption of the new Course of study has standardized the requirements
and furnished a goal for each teacher- class room and industrial- to
strive to reach with his class. Its adoption has resulted in better
instruction.
