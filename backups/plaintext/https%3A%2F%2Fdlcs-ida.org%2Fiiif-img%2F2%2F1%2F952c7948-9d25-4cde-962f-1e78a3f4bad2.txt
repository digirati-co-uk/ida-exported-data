water, but sufficient for ordinary purposes.
There is no pro
vision for putting out fires beyond a few buckets, but this is not
imperative as the buildings are of stone or adobe with sheet iron
or tin roof and as near fire- proof as buildings usually are.
The
location
of these buildings is very good- it is true they are
one mile distant from the three villages of the Moqui's, located
on the top of a rocky bluff, but for reasons which I will state
hereafter the farther the schools are from the villages the
better.
BUILDINGS- SECOND MESA.
The location of these buildings is 115 miles from the
Agency, 22 miles from Keam's Canyon.
The object of placing
ww
these buildings at this point was for the purpose of day schools
for the two towns( Ma- shong- na- vi and Sa- po- li- ni,) established
-*
in 1897. The buildings are located in an almost unapproachable
site
sisht, especially during the winter and spring months, when the
roads are almost
impassible for even a buck- board, which I gen
erally use in traveling through the country as preferable to any
other conveyance.
Why such a location should ever have been
selected I do not know unless it was to be near what was called
" the sacred spring of the Moqui's".
The buildings consist of
one three room
dwelling for employees- one school- building of two
rooms, one of the rooms being used for the purpose of noon- day
lunch.
The buildings are in good condition, well supplied with
water and every convenience necessary for a day school.
There
are
no provisions for extinguishing fires for the reason that the
buildings
are practically
fire- proof.
I have nothing
to recom
mend in regard to the improvement
of these buildings.
