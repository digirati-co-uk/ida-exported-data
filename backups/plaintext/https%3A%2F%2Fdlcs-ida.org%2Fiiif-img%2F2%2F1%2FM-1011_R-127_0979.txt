SchoolsWhat has been accomplished during the yearwhich has been more satisfactory than the year preceding?That would be hard to say. The school is in a general wayin better condition than ever before. It is not perfect,nor do I claim that in every repsect it is a model institution. But we are getting results. One of the surest evidences of that fact is that when our gradua tes( Grade VIII)transfer to other schools to take the senior vocationalcourse, they make good. At I feel that the general planeof intelligence during the past year has been raisedconsiderably.Good use in being made of our playground apparatus.We haven' t very much excepting that which is set up aroundthe girls' building. Only partially is systematic supervision given to playground activities. All competitiveplayground activities are carefully supervised. The noncompetitive activites are only partially supervised. ButIn my opinion they are sufficiently supervised. Sponta-neous play is often more to be desired than any other kind.One of the defects of the Indian Service is over- supervision.
