Santa Fe, N. 1., Nov. 28th, 1903,
W. D. Lovell,
Minneapolis, Minn.
Dear Sir:
Replying to your favor of the 24th inst., permit me to say the Supt.
of the N. M. Penitentiary informs me that he can furnish you all the
brick needed
at$ 7.00 per M. at the Pen. It will cost about 50 cents
per M. to get them hauled to the school.
All it costs for sand and
gravel here is the hauling, or from 50 to 75 cts, per load. Suitable
building stone costs not to exceed$ 5. per cord. Lime can be bought for
25 cts. per bushel at the Pen. Cement is worth from$ 5. to$ 6. per bbl.
Unskilled labor can be had
f√∏r from$ 1.00 to$ 1.25 per day. This is
Mexican labor. Brickmasons get about$ 5. per day, and they are hard to
get for even that at times, In Ariz. they sometimes get$ 6.00 per day.
Carpenters can be had from$ 2.50 to$ 3.00 perday. There is no set price
for hauling from town; there are plenty of draf teams and I suppose for
any reasonable price you can get hauling done; the distance is about
two miles. You can hire a man and team for$ 3.00 per day. Coxon
dimension lumber 18 held here at the yards at about$ 22. per M., but
I get the same at a mill
up the D.& R. G. delivered at the school for
$ 18.00 per M.
I am very respectfully/
Norde
e
Superintendent.
