The DouglasFir is found only in very limited quantities and ononly a few selected sites.The Pinon juniper type extends from the valleybottoms to the top of the me sas and is found on avariety of soils and sites. The pinon pine is of nocommercial value for lumber and does not grow tosaw- log size. The juniper, too, is small ana irregularlyshaped and has no commercial value other than forfence posts and cordwood for local use.In general there is very little merchantabletimber on the Zuni Indian Reservation.The yellowpine grows in limited areas and in some instances insuch quantities that the use of a small portablesawmill is justifiable. The me sa region in the southand southeast part of the reservation has quite alarge body of yellow pine timber of merchantable size.However a large part of this me renanta ble tinber lieswithin the National Forest and railroad lands withinthe boundaries of the Zuni Reservations.
