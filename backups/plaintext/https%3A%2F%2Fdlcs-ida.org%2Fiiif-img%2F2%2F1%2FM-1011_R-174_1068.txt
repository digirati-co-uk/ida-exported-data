The yellow pine grows only in small groups and is
generally quite patchy. The yellow pine areas are
so intermixed with the pinon- juniper that in reality
there is no separate yellow pine type. The Douglas
Fir is found only in very limited quantities and on
only a few selected sites.
The Pinon juniper type extends from the valley
bottoms to the top of the me sas and is found on a
variety of soils and sites. The pinon pine is of no
commercial value for lumber and does not grow to
saw- log size. The juniper, too, is small ana irregularly
shaped and has no commercial value other than for
fence posts and cordwood for local use.
In general there is very little merchantable
timber on the Zuni Indian Reservation.
The yellow
pine grows in limited areas and in some instances in
such quantities that the use of a small portable
sawmill is justifiable. The me sa region in the south
and southeast part of the reservation has quite a
large body of yellow pine timber of merchantable size.
However a large part of this me renanta ble tinber lies
within the National Forest and railroad lands within
the boundaries of the Zuni Reservations.
