We stand before you as the Senior class, andhave you not wondered how we attained this position? It is somewhat a mysteryto you, but to us, it is not. We are on the threshold of graduation and if it werenet for the key you see in my hands, it would not have been possible. You say toyourselves, Why are they so concerned over a mere key? Only this; it is a symbolof leadership, of character, and the open “ se- sa- me ” to knowledge. Do you notwonder then why we are so concerned? You gaze at us in awe- inspiring astonishment, but it is only natural when one sees such a wonderful thing, he can onlygaze and gaze. This key has opened the door to higher learning. It has helpedus to attain one of our fondest hopes, and our gratitude cannot be expressed inmere words.In this key is a secret chamber within which is a message for you, the class of1933.Will the president of the Juniors please come forward? This message is fromthe class of 1927 and I hope its significance will not be ignored: “ Mr. President:It is indeed an honor to present this token to you; I sincerely hope it will be aninspiration to you, the class of 1933, although it will not open the bakery shop.I charge you, therefore, to guard it well and faithfully, let it be your guide to finerthings of life. ”Juniors, you may be seated. This is the first time you have ever stood formore than a minute without going to sleep before the Seniors. I thank you.U2L2uPupupupupupuPleuelPLEVZUELPLEVELELELEMELPUPPUPPIPOPIPAPIPIPOPIPOSUÇLE!EUCLCIUÇUCUEUCUCUCLELELELELELELELE2LZUZLZLELCLCLCLCLCULUCUCUCUÇUCUCUÇUÇUCUÇLÇUÇUÇUCUÇLCUÇUCUCUCUCUCUCURUCUCURחכחכחכחכחכחכוחבוחבוחבוחבוחבוחלחלחלחלחכותבותלחכותבותכותבתבותכותבותכותבותכותבותכתבוחבוחבוחבוחבוחבוחבוחן
