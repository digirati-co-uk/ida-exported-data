" A friend knows the song in your heart and will sing it back
to you when you have forgotten the words." My friends and
teachers have unbelievably been there for me my entire year.
They have become pure poetry and a big part of my life. My
family has supported me and along with friends and teachers,
taught me a whole lot. Each individual that I have
encountered throughout the year, opened my eyes and my
heart. I enjoyed high school and will never forget it XOXO
