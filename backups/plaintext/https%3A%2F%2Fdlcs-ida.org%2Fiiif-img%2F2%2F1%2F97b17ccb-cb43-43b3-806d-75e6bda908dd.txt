( c) Agricultural and Industrial Development.
( 1) On the Reservation.
On the reservation proper there is very little agricultural develop
ment; this for the reason that water is very scarce. Some three or four
irrigated fams are producing good yields at the present time. Dry
faming on allotments east of the reservation is proving successful.
Expansion of the agricultural activities wherever water can be developed
will in the future be stressed and followed up. If a sizable irrigation
project could be developed not too far from the available ranges, it
should prove a boon for the Nava jos under this jurisdiction.
The ranges
now in use are inadequate for support of the present herds. Forage crops
to supplement the range forage would be the logical solution of the
present predicament. Stock raising is the chief source of income here
and it bohooves us to develop that industry to a fine science. The
preliminary steps are being taken at this time for the upbuilding and
promotion of this business.
( 2) off the Reservation( Employment)
In years past, many Navajos were employed in the lumber camps of Now
Moxico and Arizona as well as being employed by the Santa Fe Railroad.
This satisfactory employment condition has undergone a change during the
past two years, which has tominated the employment of 80% to 90% of the
formerly industrialized Navajo off the reservation. It seems that the
Santa Fe Company has ceased employing Navajos in favor of non- citizen
Mexican laborers. Stops have been taken to rectify this jun just act on
the part of that employor. Many skilled silversmiths and other artisans
have found profitable employment in nearby cities and toms.
