sir,
I have the honour to inform you that I heard* discussion botton
somn banitor officers a few days ago, and as it was claimed that in case
a National Bank in which public funds, ter whio I am responsible
should fail
I would be held responsible under my bond for such money
as might be thlro at date of railure, and it has occured to me that in
any avant
I would have to look to Congress for releir, should such a
thing occur
I request if I am held responsible in case of such fai.
lurs. horearter you will please toposit all tunds intoand for
many school, In a L. 3. Pubtreasury's car., I have no reason
to doubt
the solvency of this Bank in Santa Fe, but think it all right, to ni
respects o But in the present uncertain disturbance on
the manoy quos
tion I do not prapose to take any chances
so far as my official bond
is concorpedo
