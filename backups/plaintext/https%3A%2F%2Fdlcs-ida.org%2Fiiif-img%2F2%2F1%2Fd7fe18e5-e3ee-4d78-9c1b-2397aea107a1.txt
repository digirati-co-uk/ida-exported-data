Eastern Nava jo Agency
( b) Mucation-
The Eastern Navajo Boarding School is the only school of this type
within this jurisdiction. One day school at Pinodale is maintained with
a capacity of twenty- five children. The Indians very much desiro another
boarding school, with a capacity of 200 children, to be located in the
Star Lake country and we are very much in accord with their desire for
the establishment of a boarding school there; that beginners may attend
school as near home as possible as they do not like to see their little
children sent far away from home any better than white parents do, and
in fact, white people ordinarily would not comply with such a request to
send little folks away to a boarding school where they could not see
them for a year or more, and the Nava jos show just as much parental
affection for their children as white people, and we trust that it will
be possible for the office to consider another boarding school that the
necessity for sending children to Ignacio of tender age oan be discon
tinued, as we have always con tend od that all children should be given
the provocational training in the Indian country on the reservation, or
wherever the Indians may live, as near to their homes as consistently possible,
By the time they are through the sixth grade, considerable numbers of
children have then begun to appreciate the necessity for their attendance
to vocational schools and there is less opposition on the part of the
parents, after they have passed the lower grados.
One day school is maintained at Lake Grove by the Seventh Day
Adventists, operated for several years past, and they have done good work
in the classroom. At Rehoboth Mission a boarding school with a capacity
of 225 is ma intained and very good work has boen accomplished there. At
Farmington another mission boarding school with a capacity of 100 children
is successfully operated. Additional day schools should also be provided
for the localities where there are enough children living within reach
of this type of school.
