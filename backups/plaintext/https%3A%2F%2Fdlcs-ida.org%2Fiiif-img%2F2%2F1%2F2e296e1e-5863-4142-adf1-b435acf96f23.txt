Each Pueblo has from time immemorial
had a government
of
its own, and we interfere
just as little as possible
with
this government
, providing
it works in conjunction
with
us. They have a governor and a council who act some what
in the way that a mayor of a city and a city council do.
I think it wise to continue
this system so long as we can
do it to the advantage
of the Indian, and I bedieve that this
can be done at the present time.
We have no Individual
Indian Money or other funds that
we pay to the Indians from time to time, nor are there any
trust funds held by the Government
which will be turned
over to them at some future time, consequently
, they can
anticipate
the receipt of nothing of this nature in the
future and, on this account, are much better off than
many of our Indians throughout the country who are better
fixed financially
than are they.
