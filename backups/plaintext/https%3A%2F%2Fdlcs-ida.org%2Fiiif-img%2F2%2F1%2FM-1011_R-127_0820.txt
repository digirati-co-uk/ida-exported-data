Up to ayear ago, it was 25 by 25, but I doubled it during the pasttwelve months The chief use for this department of ouractivities is to take care of our ornamental plants during theCold season However, we al so use it to" start" the younggarden truck in the spring before growing weather outside hasCome on.We have a dairy herd of about twenty cows, nearl y allof the milk from which is used in the pupils' food. All ourC attle are Holstein- Frierians. In connection with this depart-ment of our activities, the boys who do the milking are naturallytaught the care and feeding of milk animals, as well as thetheory and practice of dairy sanitationThe employee carried on our payroll as" IndustrialTeacher" is really the head farner. All of his time is givenover to plant production. The employee carried on our payrol. l.as" Gardener" has charge of the dairy herd, the piggery andthe poultry. If he has any time left after taking care ofthose three departments, he helps out with plant production.We generally have one of the low- sal aried assistants helpingout on the fam, too.A number of our boys are spending the summer workingfor people about the city. This is not exactly on the planof the outing system, although I know where they are and whatthey are doing. They are with good substantial people, whowill have a proper influence upon these young fellows,as wellas teach them some thing worth their while to know and alsopay them a reasonable financial return for their work.SuperintendentD/-
