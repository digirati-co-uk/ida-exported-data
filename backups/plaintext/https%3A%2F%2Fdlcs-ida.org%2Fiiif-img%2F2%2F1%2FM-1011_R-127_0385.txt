Annual Report, 1926Sn Juan Agency.- N A R R A T I v ES E C T I O N-Section IIISchoolsIt is not easy to describe the relationship thatexists between the public school and the Indian schoolsof the San Juan jurisdiction for they scarcely touch atany point. There is a public school at ET oadlena about200 yards trom the Toadlena Boarding school, which ismaintained solely for the accommodation of the childrenof the Indian Trader, the local Missionary, and theGovernment Employees. Ir addition to these vihite childrenhere were nine Indian pupils attending this public schoolthe past year. These are the children of Indians thatreside in the vicinity of Toadlena. The very friendliestrelations exist between these two schools, there beingno Ovidence of any unpleasant racial feeling. Indianpupils are welcomed at this school and are made to feelat home there. A public school is likewise, and for likereasons, maintained at Shiprock. However,there are noIndian chil√§ren in attendance except two boys who lastyear completed the sixth grade at the San Juan Schooland who desired and intended to enroll at the ShermanInstitute last fall. These boys sought and secured employment for the summer months in Colorado and were outof touch with the Superintendent. When they returned aboutSeptember first, it was to learn that the Sherman Institute was full and, as they were unwilling to accept transfer to other Indian schools to which transfer was possiblethey re- entered the San Juan School and were perInittedto take the seventh grade in the local public school. Theseboys took this work side by side with white children andtheir teacher advises that the quality of work done bythem was fully equal to that done by the whites. There isno thought of racial feeling. The Methodist IndustrialMission near Farmington permitted one of their pupils toattend public school in Farmington. Other than in thesethree instances, there is, so far as I know, no placewhore the public school touches or affects the Indiansof the San Juan resorvation,The San Juan School proper has an enrollment of alittle over 200, or considering it in connection withthe Mesa Unit, of a little over 400, with a like attendance. Its most serious drawback is and always hasbeen its domestic water supply. This supply comes fromthree different sources:12ELECTRICTRONGRADEGREGISTRAZIERREDIT
