The hoating
, ventilation, and not sanitation of this B
good. Tho only improvement I would make is that some kind
of a ventilator ba provided for the sowing room which at
present is inadequately ventilat od.
Our bathing apparatus is adequato to our needs and works well.
The school that water closets for pupils us O arr remarkably
good. The ventilation of the closets is so perfect that there
is absolutely no odor apparent in the room. Visitors to the
school and inspecting officials have repeatedly spoken of it.
The employee bathroom is adequate to our needs but the water
closet is a very inferior one and is not properly ventilated.
For ventilating the swing room a small star ventilator
would perhaps be the best appliance. The employes closet
might be connected with the same ventilator as the St
sewing room, these two rooms adjoining each other.
