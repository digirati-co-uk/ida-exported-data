Hopi 5.SECTION II- HEALTH.1.General Health Conditions are good.2. Last Winter we lost many Indians, young and old, inepidemics of flu and Pneumonia. We had many cases, bothin the sohools and in the homes.ornNoth3. We still continue to improve on sanitary conditions,though a critic would still say the conditions are bad.We see a marked improvement each year under our efforts andwith the assistance of the field ma trons and nurses. Ifwe had two hustling physicians we would be able to makea greater and more effecting showing each year.Our four field ma trons are located at points onlyadjacent to Hopi Villages and we are gutting fineresults through their efforts. The Navajos, unfortunately,have no field matrons.b. We greatly need field matrons or field nurses to workamong the Navajos as well as among the Hopis. We woulddo great work if we had them and why are they notentitled to them as well as the Hopi? The Navajos arekindly people, greatly influenced by good women.8. Whave one physician, located at Oraibi, who takessplendid interost in Tuberculosis and Trachoma, but hehas no way of hand ling the casos excepting at the Indianhomes. This makes his work negligible. The present physifoian at Keams Canon apparently has no interest in eye workand never gets in a case in his hospital of his owninitiative. We could do much more work of that kind here.There should be a small sanatorium located at Oraibi,that place being 45 miles west from here.+d. It would not be practicable to establish tenthospitals here on account of the severe winter weather.We have had them in the summer time here, as this summer.Dr. Ross, with his outfit, on special Trachoma workon this reserve this summer has made a splendud showing anddone wonderful work among both the Hopis and Navajos, Itis expected we will have covered this reserve by timeHinter Comos. It is one of the finest things ever happeningto or done for these Indians. lan we expect follow- upwork by competent nurses? It is necessary 11 the properand lasting results in this Trachoma Work is gotten.The only prevention to 100 per cent. efficiency inour Hospital Work is that we have a young physician whodoes not take proper interest in getting his hospitalfull and operating under" high- peak" loads. We have allkinds of cases he should handle with no effort, apparently,to either get them in the hospital or attend to themin the homes of the Indians, I feel that our hospitalnhy. Seeme armuCHO
