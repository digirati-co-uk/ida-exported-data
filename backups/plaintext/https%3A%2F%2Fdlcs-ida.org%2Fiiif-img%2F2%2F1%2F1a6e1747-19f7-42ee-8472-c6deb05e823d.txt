fellow would at times grab for the largedt slicy of bread beforeOnly two booklets were made on the Farm unit althougha great many drawings were made.After the farm unit was completed we had a short circusunit which not only taught some of the more common circusanimals but afforded the children quite a lot of pleasure too.Tents were put up in the back of the room and clay animalswere made. The ahildren enjoyed counting the animals andplaying circus. One booklet on circus animals was made for thisunit.The Trading Post and Play Hogan unit developed out of theinterest the children had in the trading post at Crownpoint.As the girls had not had many opportunities to visit the tradingpost we made a trip to it for the purpose of just looking itover.By this time the children were able to talk a little more80 discussions were held as to what a store was for, who wentthere, what they did in the store, what the childrens' mothersand fathers went to the store for, how they went, where theygot money to buy things with, etc. This of course createdinterest in making a trading post as well as a ho gan largeenough to be played in so that the situation would be more realand the children could play at being grown ups.It took quite a while to decide on the locations of thetrading post and hogan, size of store and hogan, materials from& which to make them etc. We discussed what their own hoganswere made from, that the trading post was made from etc.The different tasks were selected for the building of the hoganas it was thought best to make that first. Some boys broughtthe proper sized stones into the classroom for the hogan, othersout the stones evenly, some brought olay, so me mized the clay,some did the actual building, some got the logs for the roof,and some of the larger boys measured and cut the window anddoor frames.The girls did not take part in the actual building of thehogan but they were kept happy and busy making mattresses,pillows, sheets, pillow cases, quilts, table covers, windowourtains eto. Not only did the girls make these things for thehogan but they also made curtains for the kindergarten windows.These curtains were measured, hemmed and decorated with twocolors of yarn by the girls. The girls each made and dressed adoll for her self.chairsThe furniture makers for the hogan constructedfour twotables, and three beds. They did not make a stove as we alreadyhad one left from last year that could be used very nicely.Thebuildingof thetradingpostwasnota difficult
