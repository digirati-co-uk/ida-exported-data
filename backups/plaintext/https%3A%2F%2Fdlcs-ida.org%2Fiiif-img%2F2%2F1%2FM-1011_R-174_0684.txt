As compared with the accomplishments of the pre

outlined with less opposition and a greater disposition
towards progressivene B8.

The sentiment of the community is against the inter
mingling of races. We have no mixed marriages among
the Indians and whites.
Total expenditures for all purposes during the
current fiscal year were considerably less than during
the preceding year. This may be accounted for by a
1ittle stricter economy, generally, and the fact that
a less amount was expended from the building fund.
Playground apparatus is made good use of. More
benefit is derived for this than any other maens of
recreation about the school.
Systematic supervision is given all player ound
- activities.

The girls are given sitting up exercises, They
play basket ball. They use the slides and swings.
They take part in group games on the campus, and in
sociables held eury two weeks.

In my opinion it will be necessary to continue
Government schools on the jurisdiction for many years.
The Zuni Reservation was one of the last to be provided
with school facilities. It is far from settled country.
No chance of having district schools to attend for the
reason that this is a wild, barren country, very unpDD
ductive,
