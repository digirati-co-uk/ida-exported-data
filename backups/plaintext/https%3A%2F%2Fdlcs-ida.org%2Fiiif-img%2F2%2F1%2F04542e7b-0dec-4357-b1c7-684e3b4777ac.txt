Arithmetic, as has been explainod, was carried on in
connection with the units selected, wherever possible.
When
ever certain skills were found lacking, drills were given to
master them. The idea back of all the work in numbers was
practicability.
Reading came from unit sub joot matter, related stories,
histories, geographies, number problems, WEEKLY READERS,
reference books, and things of that sort.
Geography and history, as such, were studied in connection
with the units chosen.
Language was carried on to suit the needs of the units.
Lotters were written, original stories composed, and stories
told orally. Pronounciation and enunoiation were given much
attention.
Piotured material was used a great deal. I have&
large file of several hundred pictures from which to draw.
The WEEKLY READER Was used in these two levels, Pictures
and stories related to the articles in the papers were used.
Places were located on the maps, and peoples and nations dis
cussed as to customs, dress, government, and such.
Other material that came up from time to time, and yet
was more or less unrelated to the units was:

serve them.

of a colonial day.
