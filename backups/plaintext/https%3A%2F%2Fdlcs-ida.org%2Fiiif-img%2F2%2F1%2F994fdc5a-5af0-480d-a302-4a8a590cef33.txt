Leupp Training School( 19)EDUCATION DIVISION--- APPOINTMENTS SECTION.OFINDIRA4AUG311910CELATHOTE »AFFAIRS( 1) The Leupp School and Agency is located on the LittleColorado River, a muddy stream with a few cottonwood trees fringingit, which flows water possibly six months in the year.The Riveritself is entirely devoid of any interesting scenery.The countryis a desert such as predominates in northern Arizona, with a sparsegrowth of grass and scrub.The scrub growth consists usually ofgreasewood and salt bush. To the west, distant about fifty miles,one has a gooå view of the San Francisco Mountains; on the east,at about the same distance, the Mo qui Buttes are to be seen.The San Francisco Wash, the outlet of Canon Diablo, empties intothe Colorado River about 1- 1/ 2 miles below the School. Some goodscenery is to be found along the Canon, but the topography of thecountry is such that it is difficult of approach. I cannot saythat Leupp is a particularly interesting place in which to live.( 2) The climate in this country is fairly good-- by many peopleit is considered an excellent climate for the greater part of the year.However, about three moiths âuring the Spring high winds occur,which are very unpleasant until one becomes used to them.Thetemperaturein winter ranges from zero( occasionally) upward, andin summer, in the hottest part, to 102-- 105. In this high altitude,however, the heat is not oppressive, as such a temperature would bein the east.( 3)The altitudeof thisSchooland Agencyis about4500feet
