Braves Football
Where the boys become men, and where the
grass grows in the heat of battle. The Braves football
team showed that only the strong survive. The Braves
showed much courage and spirit. We had much fun
and a good time playing, and we rang" Victory"
against Springer. But we had a tough season, and we
wish the team better luck next year. Go Braves!
