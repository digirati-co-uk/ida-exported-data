the adults as well.
( a) It is the opinion of this office that some action should
be taken to limit the time that the dances start in the fall
and end in the spring; and as the parents, while in the dance,
pay no attention to their children some sort of curfew law
should be inaugurated, with sufficient Indian police who can
insist upon the children' s receiving a sufficient number of
hours of sleep.
( b) The children and returned students not only are permitted
to attend and participate in the dances but unless they do
this they incur the extreme displeasure of the older Indians.
6.( a) very few of the Indians comply with the State laws regard
ing marriage and divorce.
( b). We work with the missionaries in an endeavor to secure
the Indians' compliance with the State law but with very lit
tle success. Unless all are compelled to observe the law, very
little progress can be made in this matter.
( c) The superintendent is not deputized to issue marriage li
censes, and this is unnecessary as they can be easily secured
from the County Clerk' s office at Gallup.
The State laws are adequate to meet conditions on the reser

the State could extend over the reservation and some instru
mentality, as is contained in the Simms Bill, for having some
representative upon the reservation for handling cases here.
8.
There is no Indian court upon the Zuni reservation. Where
the necessity arises the Zuni officers handle such cases with
the assistance of the superintendent.
9.
There is one Catholic and one Protestant mission upon the
Zuni reservation.
10. The present status of the liquor trafric is the same as upon
other reservations in this section, in that a certain amount
of liquor is introduced here.
