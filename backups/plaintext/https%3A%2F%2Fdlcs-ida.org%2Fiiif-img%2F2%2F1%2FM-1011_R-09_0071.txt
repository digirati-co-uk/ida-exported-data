ANNUAL REPORTR9UNITED STATES INDIAN SCHOOLCarlisle, Pa.M. Friedman, SuptYear ending June 30, 1910In discussing the kind of education which it is the aimof the Carlisle school to give to the youth who are members ofthe race of our American Indian, Chief Justice Horace E. Deemer( of Iowa), in a letter to the undersigned, among other things,said:" Iy only regret is that such a system of education is notgiven to white men as well as red." Briefly, that is the opinionexpressed in letters received during the year from hundreds ofthe most prominent people in the United States and abroad.In the same way, it is the opinion of scores of America' s leadingnewspapers and periodicals. It seems to have become a settledconviction among those who have carefully looked into the subjectthat Carlisle' s scheme of education is based not only upon rationalprinciples of psychology, but it more finitely fits the real needsof the American Indian.Carlisle is a vocational School. It is neither a collegenor a university. Its efforts have been consistently in the√¢irection of providing thorough training for Indian boys and girlswhich will Pit them for the duties and responsibilities of anhonest, law- abiding, industrious, American citizenship.
