Junior boys, please stand that all may know these words arefor you.Don' t scare the neighbors living close to the campus whooping songs byputting up Indian dances. If you want dances, go up on the hills out of the cityand there will be no complaints.Keep out of mischief so you won' t disturb the sleep of your teachers byworking early in the morning to serve your extra duty.This has been mentioned time and again, but please let this be the last time:Keep away from the Mexican dances. Just because the girl friend is angry atyou, don' t expect to dance it off over there, for it will only cause greater trouble,besides Tom or Mr. Ferris will be sure to bring you backMake sure that you are present at every bed check, your name is liable tobe called and remember a dummy could not possibly answer “ present ” for you.The walk by the D. S. is beyond your boundary line, so instead of usingthat walk go around back of the gym.I expect you to know that the kitchen girls are always busy trying to giveyou your meals on time, so don' t go over there and ask them for sandwiches.If you fail at the kitchen, don' t turn around to the bakery; the bakers countevery loaf that comes out of the oven.The rooms at the old club building are for the university students, so don' tgo over there and monopolize the windows to talk to the girl friend.Slick up for your meals, especially for supper. Whatever you do, don' ttake salt shakers out and deprive other boys of salt.Don' t ever go to assemblies or church in your shirt sleeves; wear a coat anda tie.Don' t let Mr. Jones and his boys waste their time picking up orange andbanana peelings after you; use the trash cans.Junior boys, keep your hearts locked and your minds open until next commencement so that you may most industriously apply yourselves to problems oflearning in the classrooms and shops.You have come but three- fourths of the way of your high school course;unless you go on, you will be deprived of a diploma, which is a satisfactory introduction to the future employer of high school boys.Fail not this summer to make the most of your chances to apply your industrial training. The hard knocks you' ll get will only give you added experience and will help you to develop a strong will power.Let not the glitter of gold or the jingle of silver dollars of your summerearnings keep you from entering your Senior year at the Albuquerque IndianSchool. Another year in school will give you a larger earning capacity and awiser head to spend your income.nanananananananananananananananananananananananananananananananananananananan2222222222222namanan LCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCULUCULUCULULUCULUCULULUCULUCULLEULUCULUCULULUCULUCULUCULUCULUCULUCULULUPULUCULULUCUELEPUZLCLCLCLCLCUCUCUCUCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLUCUCUCUCUEMNNNNEUCUCLכחכחכוחכותבותכותבתכתבותכותבכותבותכותבותכותבוחבותלחלחלחכחכחכחכחבלוחכתכתבותבר
