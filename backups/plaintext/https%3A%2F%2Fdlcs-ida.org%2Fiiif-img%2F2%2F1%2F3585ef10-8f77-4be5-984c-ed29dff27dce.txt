Our friends at Leuppworked unceasingly that the angry flood waters of the Little Colorado would not bringtermination to our efforts; but their work would have been in vain had not the employees,here, given hearty support.They kindly took us in and made us welcome, though their classrooms were alreadycrowded; and they, themselves, over- worked.In closing, in behalf of the “ Refugee Class of Leupp," again, I thank you; and I assureyou that we shall endeavor to be ever worthy of this kindness, hearty support, and good will.תלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחלחבובתלתלתלתלתלתלתלתלתלתלתלתלתבכתבהלClassSongDEAR OLD LEUPP, WE' RE ALL FOR YOU( Air: Froggies, We' re All for You)U PUDUCUDUWe' ll raise a song, both loud and strong,To cheer our class to Vic- to- ry;For Dear Old Leupp, so tried and true,We pledge e- ter- nal loy- al- ty.We' ve kept the fight, with spirit trueFor Dear Old Leupp, we' re all for you.Hail to our col- ors strong and brave,May they long wave on high,Dear Old School, we are all for you.Your peaks so high, your turquoise sky,Your herds and flocks, your crags and rocks,Each canyon wall, and cliff aboveOur every thought of you is LOVE.We' ve kept the fight, with spirit true,For Dear Old Leupp, we' re all for you.Hail to our col- ors strong and brave,May they long wave on high,Dear Old School, we are all for you.UEUEUEUEUDEDEUDEUUUDLEDIUCNCNCUCIUCUCIUCUCUCUCUCUÇUCUÇUSUÇUCUSUÇUCUCUCUCUCUCURUPUPPIPOPPPN PO PnPnP- הדהדחרחרחרחרחרחרחרוחבוחבוחבוחכותבותבותכותבותכותבותכותבותכותבותכותבותבותכותבוחבוחבוחבוחבוחבוחבוחבוחבותו
