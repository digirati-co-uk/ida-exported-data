Drugs are a bigproblem and it is going to be a biggerproblem if we don' t do anything aboutit. Teenagers use drugs to be tough orto get a high. I think that drugs are fornothing. I' ve taken drugs before, but Ididn' t get anywhere. I just started toflunk my classes and have argumentswith my parents, my peers, and myfriends. So now I stopped taking drugsand I feel good and happy about my lifeSIZZLING EVENTS
