ADMINISTRATION
To the Ninth Grade:
You are to be congratulated for having
completed your work at the Santa Fe In
dian School. We hope that you are re
garding this promotica as the gateway
to an opportunity for continuing your
school experience.
Many more young workers are entering
the labor ranks each year. At the same
time the demand for workers with a high
school and college education goes up
and up. Any youth without a good edu
cation will find it very difficult to
get a job.
Whether your goal is college or a
trade, we hope to learn that everyone
of you has enrolled in high school
next year.
Not everyone should go to college, but
every boy and girl should continue his
training so that he can be prepared to
do his very best in whatever field of
work he selects.
V. L. Beggs
Agency Director of Schools
On behalf of the staff of Santa Fe In
dian School, I present you with this im
portant challenge. The decades ahead
foretell a potential world which may
make it possible to overcome many of
man' s ills and make our world a more
peaceful and satisfying place in which
to live.

Be prepared to meet the stringent de
mands of this modern world of science
and technology by continuing your edu
cation. Plan well for the future in
terms of your own personal interests,
aptitudes, and desires. The future
will soon be in your hands. You must
be able to accept this mighty challenge
when it comes.
