Ir. John B. Balmer,
Sept. Lapp Agency.
SEP 16 1929
Dear Mr. Balmer:
Pages 5- 130, 5- 1308 and 3 are returned to your orrice
for correction. You can readily see that it is incorreat to list
384 births during the year and no deaths. In order to make your
figures any where near accurate it will be essential that you es
pimate the mmber of deaths which occurred on your reservation during
the fiscal year 1929. To do this it is suggested that you use the
average for the whole Indian Service which showed a death rate for
1928 of 21. 8 per housand. Please correct your figures accordingly
and as they affect all three pages, it M111 be necessary to submit
new ones at once for use in comestion with the Commissioner' s anmal
/ report.
Sincerely yours,
( Signed).]. Henry Scatter good
Assistant Commissioner.
