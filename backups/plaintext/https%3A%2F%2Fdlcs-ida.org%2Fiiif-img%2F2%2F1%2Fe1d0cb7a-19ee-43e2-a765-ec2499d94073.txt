You can readily see that it is incorreat to list384 births during the year and no deaths. In order to make yourfigures any where near accurate it will be essential that you espimate the mmber of deaths which occurred on your reservation duringthe fiscal year 1929. To do this it is suggested that you use theaverage for the whole Indian Service which showed a death rate for1928 of 21. 8 per housand. Please correct your figures accordinglyand as they affect all three pages, it M111 be necessary to submitnew ones at once for use in comestion with the Commissioner' s anmal/ report.Sincerely yours,( Signed).].
