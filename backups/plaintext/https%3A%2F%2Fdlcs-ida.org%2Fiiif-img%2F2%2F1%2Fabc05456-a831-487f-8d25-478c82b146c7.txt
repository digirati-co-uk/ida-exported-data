total school room capacity of 348 pupils.
My intention is, for the present, to use all of the rooms indi

not be" dark" because the" landings" are inclosed with glass on two

kiles and the ventilation of the landings" is as perfoct as it would
be were the" landings" not inclosed.
In case the proportion of the girls should increase so as to crowd
their present dormitory, and more space should be noeded for them, then,
ire plan to run a partition diagonally across the hall at the intersec
$ ionot the two balls, thus making a perfect separation of the rooms.
