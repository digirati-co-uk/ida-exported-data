NARRATIVEPago 19.Section VIII- Contracts.Annual Report, 1914.Once a year a business council of all the mostIntelligent members of the tribe of both sexes is called.This council is held at some convenient time for thediscussion of such topics as may be of common interestto the tribe and for thojnbatter welfare. The Court ofIndian orlenses also meets once a month and at such timesa considerable number come to the Agency on business andat these meetings various subjects are discussed. Amongthe topics are plural merriage; home building; improvementof stock; development of water; additional school facilitiesfor their children, etc. I find that these councils arean important factor in securing the cooperation of theNavajos in metters of this kind.No per capita payments have ever beenmade this tribe which I consider a blessing in disguse.
