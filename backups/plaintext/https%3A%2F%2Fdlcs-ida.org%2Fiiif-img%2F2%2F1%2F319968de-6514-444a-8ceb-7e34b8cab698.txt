Sir:
I have the honor to state that in the plan submitted for the
laundry building, a solid piece of masonry, upon which to stand the
drier, was omitted. This foundation is an absolute necessity and with
00: it the revolusions or motion of the machinery will be too great
a strain on the building. Also in the center of the building there
should be a substantial pillar with braces extending to the ceiling
to support the same.
I respectfully ask authority to expend a sum not exceeding$ 40/ 50
