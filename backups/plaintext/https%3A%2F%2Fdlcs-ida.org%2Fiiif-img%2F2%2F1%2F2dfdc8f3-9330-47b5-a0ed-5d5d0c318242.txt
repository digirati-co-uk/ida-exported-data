SMOKE STACK AND SCENE AT THE NEW MINE
COAL MINING
Fifteen different coal mines are operated in
the immediate vicinity of Gallup. The annual pay.
roll of these mines is approximately$ 3,000,000,
producing about 3,500,000 tons of coal a year. Over
1800 men are employed in the production of coal
in the Gallup fields.
Production will no doubt be greatly increased
in the near future, when a new mine, owned by the
Gallup American Coal Company, will be opened.
This mine is now nearing completion, the cost
of which will no doubt exceed$ 2,000,000, even
before a pound of coal is produced.
