9 AANNUAL REPORT, SANTA FE NON- RESERVATION BOARDING SCHOOLJUNE 30, 1925Section IVIndustriesIndustrial work is carried on here, the same as atall other schools, for two chief reas ons; firstto teachthe Indian youth and train them up for making an independentand honorable livolihood, and second to get routine workdone for the partial support or building up of the schoolWhat ought to be our largest industrial project is thefarm But ever since 1920, this part of the countryhas been suffering from excessive drought, so that sincethat year we have produced only verymeager crops,ornothing at all.
