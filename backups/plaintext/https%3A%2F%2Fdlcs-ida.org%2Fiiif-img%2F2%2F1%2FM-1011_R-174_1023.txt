hand made articles, the number of Zuni Indians now engaged in
this work can be more than doubled thus providing an occupation
where the Zuni can have work especially during the winter months
where he can live at home and where the necessity would not
arise for him to go to the commercial centers in an environment
not natural to him and where he would be most unhappy.
Not only have we this in view but with the development of
water the raising of truck gardens and the canning of these pro
ducts for use at those Indian schools where such cannot be pro
duced, thys supplying another opportunity for home labor for
these Indians can be found. The past two years have been most
discouraging because of the general plague of grasshoppers, and
the present year, because of the draining of the reservoir for
the placing of a larger head- gate, thus causing the loss of all
irrigation water except that used in early irrigation. The pres
ent year has been free of the grasshopper plague except in one
district but because of the past two years' experience very lit
tle has been undertaken in the way of truck gardening as it was
felt i≈ø undertaken and another plague should destroy the gardens
the Indians would be entirely discouraged. We are planning on
this development the coming year and feel that with the indivi
dual effort stressed more can be accomplished along agricultural
and livestock development lines than ever before.
