To date 3,670 allotments have been made and which are in
good stand ing; 3,583 have not been allotted, and this will give
some idea of the stupendous task before the Indian Department
to protect these stock- growing people whose rights are still
unprotected; of course, some of this number live within the
area that has been purchased or consolidated, but the majority
are still at sea as to what will be actually done for them.
In my opinion this is one of the greatest problems which now
confronts the Indian Bureau as their whole future depends on the
acquisition of the land which they are now using.
We can
expect opposition, as I have said, from the state but if our
Department does not protect the rights of all Indians, there
is no one else to do it for them, so the office should know
that this is one of the greatest human problems to be worked
out and solved for unless we feel this responsibility, we may
fail in the end. The uncertainty of our land situation has
retarded water development, developing of farm areas, and every
thing else pertaining to home life, for there is no Indian who
can make a living on his individual allotment and depend upon
the range surrounding the area in which he lives; he is alive
to the situation; he is learning the necessity for better
management of his flocks, for greater thrilt and industry, but
land matters are beyond his control.
The Nava jo farmer is only fairly successful at best for
as yet, we have not had the personnel or the equipment for use
in plowing and cultivating land and they have asked many times
for tools, implements, and wagons to be furnished and they to
pay for same by labor and in our opinion, this is worthy of
consideration for there is no market for anything which they
have for sale such as sheep or rugs and no income as there is
no labor. They have given much of their time through their
several community organizations in building roads, bridges, and
assisting in the construction of reservoirs, facing same with
rock and brush to prevent the wearing down of the embankments
through wave action.
A definite program will soon be prepared by the Irrigation
Department in conjunction with other Bureaus that a complete
survey may be made as to rodent control, water development,
improvement of range conditions, further establishing of dipping
plants, and locations of schools that a definite program may
be initiated to be carried out over a period of years, and this,
when put into effect along with protecting the Indians and the
use of their range, will be a step in the right direction.
There is no visible water supply for irrigation and the
Nava jo farmer is dependent upon rainfall and floods for the
irrigation of his crops and some years these rains fail to
