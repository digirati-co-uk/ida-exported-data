Fe, N, M., July

To the Commissioner
of Indian
Affairs
,
Washington
, D. C,
Sir
:
I have
the honor
to advise
you that the single
iron
beds
furnished
this
school
last
year by Abel
H. Frost
of Chicago
, are
of very
poor quality
and not satisfactory
.
All of the beds
tha
were furnished
by The Smith
& Davis
Mfg. Co. the previous
year
are of good quality
and in good repair
, while
all of
of Mr.
( about
50 or 60)
Prost's
beds
that have
been
in use are out of repair
. I hope
we
shall
have
no more of the quality
furnished
by Mr. Frost
.
Very respectfully
han
Superintendent
,
