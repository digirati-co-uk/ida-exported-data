D. Compton,and the Mutual Oil Syndicate. One well drilled on Section 30found fresh water in the Dakota sandstone. The top of the sandin this well is 892 feet and the total depth is 925 feet. TheIndian Office has taken over this well as a water well forthe use of the Navajos.One well is now being drilled on the east half of section13 by the Mutual Oil Syndicate. This well will go to a depthof 2500 feet in order to test out the McElmo formation andperhaps as far as the shinar urp. A depth of 1090 feet wasreached at the time this was written, securing a flow of 3,000bbls, of sulphur water a day from the top of the Dakota sandstone. The top of the Dakota is 823 feet.Another well, Compton No. 2, recently drilled in thesoutheast quarter of Section 13, encountered the top of theDakota at 775 and sulphur water was encountered when 13 feetin the sand. This well has since been plugged and abandoned.Nine small tracts located off the apex of the structurewere sold at the Santa Be sale, but the lessees have one yearwithin which to drill and to date no development has beenmade on them. These tracts are held by s. C. Munoz, J. C.Bailey, Pan- American Oil Co. and H. R. Johnson. If thetracts are developed or drilled, the formations below theDakota will have to be tested if any oil is secured.
