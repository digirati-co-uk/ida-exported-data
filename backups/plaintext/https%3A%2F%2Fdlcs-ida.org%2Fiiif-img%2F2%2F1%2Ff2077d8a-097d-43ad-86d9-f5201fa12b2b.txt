Jicarilla Agency
New Mexico
No twithstanding the drouth season of 1922 and
consequent reduction of field production the industrial
activities of the Jicarilla Indians for the fiscal year
have been encouragingly remunerative.
While
the Jicarilla
has for years been rated below par physically and too often
unable to perform a day's work in competition with the
common run of labor reservation activities have been
promoted with view of full utilization of available
labor and idleness reduced accordingly.
There are two hundred twentyfive males above
eighteen years of age and of this to tal about onethida
are above the hall century mark with twenty passed their
three- score- and- ten.
While a good per cent of this number
are incapacitated by age and physical condition for exacting
labor each and all may be engaged in light service about
their fields and garden and in care of the flocks, and it
is not uncommon to see an aged man in care of a flock of
sheep or goats.
Crop returns from agency and school farms the past
year were below normal but the acreage was such that there was
a total return almost in quantity
to meet reservation
needs.
Individual
Indians grew coon and wheat in quantities
to
meet family needs and their alfalfa and native forage
