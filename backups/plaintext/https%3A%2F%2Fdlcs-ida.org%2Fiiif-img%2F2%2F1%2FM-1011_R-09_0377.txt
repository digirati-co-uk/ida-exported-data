INDIAN.01,1910.JUL301910RECONVEDFICE UANNUAL REPORT, CARSON SCHOOL, 1910.TAND DIVISION- SALES SECTION.NAFFAIRSooUnder this heading', there is nothing specific to report except to state in a general way that the only Indian landsunder this office are scattering non- reservation allotments throdifferent parts of Nevade and over a large part of California.There probably 2, 000 such allotments that seem to be regarded asunder the Carson School supevision to some extent. There havebeen only two or three tee simple patents issued and those but recently, so that we are not prepared to report as to the success ofsuch patents. It is my opinion that the question of issuing a feesimple patent should be considered very carefully and the qualifications or die Indian thoroughly ascertained before making recommendations for such patent. I am convinced that there are a nunber of inherited all otnents to which it would be advisable toissue patents in fee but it has not been possible to investigatethese cases thoroughly over this large territory in connection withthe duties of the school. The chaotic condition of these scattering allotments has been the subject of considerable correspond-ence and various recommendations for the appointment of some person to devote his time to adjusting these various le nd natters.
