San Juan School& Agency
A comprehensive plan for the advancement of the Indians under
this jurisdiction, industrially and morally, must be based upon an
intelligent consideration of the resources of this reservation.
The Navajo has readily adapted himself to his environment
and may be considered in many ways a very successful stockman.
The energies of this school and agency, fundamentally,
are directed towards the education of the children and the older
Indians by precept and practical demonstrationi; in the application
of modern stock raising and farming methods, to the farming and
stock raising which the Indians have carried on through their own
efforts for so many years.
This is done in demonstration work, to impress them with
the necessity of putting new blood into their flocks and herds;
the
selection of better seed for planting, the improvement of
their irrigation methods; the construction of flumes and ditches
and aid in the conservation of flood waters and rainfall on which
they must depend for the cultivation of their crops in this semi
arid country.
The Navajo must largely depend upon his sheep and cattle,
and the sale of wool, mutton and beel constitutes his Income.
Farming is possible only in limited areas and can be carried on
only in mall tracts where flood waters are available for
irrigation.
