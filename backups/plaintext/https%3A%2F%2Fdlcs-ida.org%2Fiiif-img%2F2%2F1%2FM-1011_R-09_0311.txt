Comic Bioner of Indian Affairs,- 7.and having the matter thoroughly ventilated and settledOne of these eroployees resigned some months ago, and I havenot seen any indi oations for sometime now of anything of thesort above referred to, consequently, I am led to believethat we have unquestioned loyalty and cooperation upon thepart of all at present upon our pay roll,The accommodations for our employees are just nowbecoming considerably more adequate than they have hithertobeen.
