Annual Report, 1911.
Pueblo Day Schools at Santa Fe, N.1,
The Pueblo local government consists of a
Governor, Lioutonant Governor, and Principales, who manage
the business affairs of the Pueblo as well as some other
affairs. These officials are elected annually by the
Indians of the Puoblo.
No funds of any kind are disbursed to the Pueblo
Indians, and no patents in fee or certificates of com
potency or removal of restrictions have been issued to any
Pueblo Indians for the reason that the Pueblo grant lands
are held in common, and no allotments have ever been made
to them, and for the same reason there have been no sales
of inherited and surplus lands nor sales of non- competent
Indian lands.
