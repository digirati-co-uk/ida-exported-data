My dear ir, Towers:
In comection with the health section of the annual statistical
report, the Office notes that on page 5- 130 you list 217 births and
148 deaths. On page 7 of the statistical raport you give 174 births
and 117 dantha. thich of these figures are corract? You 11st 754
examinations for tuberculosis and 724 for trachoma. The office is
under the impression that there are more than this mumber of chil
drer attending school at your jurisdiction; and as instructions have
been issued the teach child be examined yearly, the number of cases
of examinations for each of those aiseases should at least equal the
number of children attending school and 11 reservation patients are
examined the number will be in excess of that.
Vory truly yours,
( Sigrad) CF. Hauke
Chiot Clork.
