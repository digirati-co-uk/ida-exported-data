NARRATIVE.
Section 2
Health.
As previously stated in this report two physicians in ad
dition to those already authorized in this jurisdiction should be
provided and two small hospitals or one hospital and one sani
torium, for the treatment of tuberculosis, should be opened on
this reservation.
The medical staff of two physicians now authorized for
this jurisdictions is entirely 1 radequate to provide the neces
sary medical attention for the approximately seven thousand
Indians scattered over the large extent of territory em traced
within this reservation.
At least two additional physicians should be provided
7
as soon as possible.
One of these physicians should be located
in the vicinity of Tocito, the other at Aneth.
Of the two
physicians now authorized, one is stationed at Shiprock, the
other at Toadlena.
We cannot hope to eliminate the medicine men and their
pernicious influences unless we can provide the Indians with
medtcallattention. It is not expected that an Indian will ride
or drive from fifty to sixty miles to secure the services of
a physician when there are medicine men within easy reach
of his hogen.
Tent hospitals or sanitaria would be impracticable
on account of climatic conditions.
