SCHOOL DAYS
. by
Mary Reyos
The crown of the home is Godliness
I love school
The beauty of the home is order
I' m nuts about learning
The glory of the home is hospitality
Home work facinates
me
The blessing of the home is
For exams I' m always yearning
contentment

Dave.
" Well, they used to tell stories a out fhosts being righ here in

FII saw it here in this house when I was about ten years old,
replied Henry.
" You' re nuts, I don' t believe those kinds of silly stories. Anyone
who has sense enough won' believe it." Well, any way how does a ghost
look?" asked Dave.
" The one I saw has a white cloth all over his body; his hands were
blcak and his eyes had seceral rings of black studd around them. If only
you hadd seen it. He looked terrible. Any one would lie to see one. I
even fainted," said Henry.
" What did the ghost do to you?" asked Dave.
" He told me in a big voice. Come here little boy. I want you. I
want you to be my partner."
HI tried hard to run but i couldn' t. By that time I didn' t know
what he did to me, answered Henry.
" Was he still htere when you woke or when you got conscious
again?
Asked Dve,
" No, he was gone. But he dropped some money, Replied Henry.
Money! Did you say money?" Requested Dave.
" Yes, he dropped about twenty cents, but I didn' t bother to pick!
tbmm up. I don' t know who picked them up, because I noticed they' re not
here anymore. Answered
Henry.
" Let' look for the ghost. We might
even find the money. Latts go.
Come on." bēgged D ve.
