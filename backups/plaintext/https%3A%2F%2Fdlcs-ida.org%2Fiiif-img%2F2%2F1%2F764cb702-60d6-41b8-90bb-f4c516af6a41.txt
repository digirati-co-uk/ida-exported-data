should have done the same with Dr. Westmall's report, had I the chance.
I am free to say that there are no better or more competent people in
the Indian Service then the two in question and without doubt both were
sincere in what they said.
But I am satisfied that should you propound
the gare question to either one of the now they would give different
answers.
I have given this new ration a faithful trial.
Miss Osoor, our
COOK, than whom there is none better, has been faithful, economical,
painstaking, car ful and tactful.
Mrs. Hall, one of the most competent
matrons in the service and unquestionably the best. COOK I ever saw, has
given the matser bor personal attention,
I have gone so far as to per.
sonally inspect the slop barrels and pig stins from day to day and!
kne that there is absolutely no preventable waste,
Hy pradezessor 10ft a small surplus of four and the garden gav.
us abundan't supply of all sorts of vegetab..os which we used without
stint but by the end of Ootober all this was gone and since then we
have constantly run behind.
For reasons given in the foregoing and in the matron's letter in
0.sed, I again respectfully request that the ration of 1894 be allowed
in this school until such time at least as we can produce vegetables,
mark atc. to supplement the rations enough to keep our children from
sing nangy
I am, very respectfully,
