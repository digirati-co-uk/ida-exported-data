The Class of 2006 waits
patiently for the year to begin.
Before you know it, your
experience at SFIS will be
over. Take in each moment
and remember the friends you
have made here. Hopefully,
the lessons you have learned
will help guide you through
the rest of your lives. Be
proud of who you are and
where you come from. You
are the SFIS Class of 2006!
