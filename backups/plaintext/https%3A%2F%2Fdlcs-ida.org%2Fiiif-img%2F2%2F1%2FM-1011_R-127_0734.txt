The general health conditions during the year
have been very satisfactory. There were no deaths at the
school among the pupils. One pupil died at her home a few
weeks after she was released from the school on a ccount of
failing health There were a number of cases of pneumo
nia, but all of the pupils attacked recovered. I Two employees
died at the school hospital of this malady.
Notwithstanding the fact that various diseases
have run riot all the past year in New Mexico, still we
Sffered very little from them at the school. There were
a few cases of measles, one or two of varioloid; now and then
a case of mumps; and one case of diphtheria
As soon as the case of diphtheria appear ed, I imme
diately ordered enough anti- diphtheria serum to treat every
person on the grounds and then saw to it that every person
got the treatment In this way, we headed off any epidemic.
At least, no other cases developed
Our Hospital Building is really rather antiquated
and poorly planned for giving the most modern and up- to- date
attention to the sick. However, no doubt we shall have to
put up with it until better times come
The present corps of employees at the school is
adequate for taking care of the health conditions
