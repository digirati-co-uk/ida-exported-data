entire mount called for on the Annual Betimas. arrived oorly in the
year and I have wted it as my judgomont Indlestod was por she bout
Interests of the school. The entire supply is now onpared and yes
much of the exposed wood- work of the buildings is unpainted. The
finish of the two largest buildings was painted nine years ago and
not is so donude of paint as to show deep Oracks in the wood. If thi.
work is not done before th. Vinter storms set in, tho expogod wood- work
will bo materially injured, 1 therefore respóctfully renow my request
and ask authority to purchase the 400 pounds of wit. 1.04 at one..
