The Commissioner of Indian Affairs
page 2.
The only discordant note appears to come from" outside help"
where there is but little understanding of the work, the needs, or
of the Indians. This is not appreciated, but it is realized that
this is one of the problems to be met and dealt with diplomatioally.
We have a feeling that the Indians realize to a certain extent that
this element has not endeavored in their best interest.
There are certain organizations busy broadcasting misinformation
here as at some other places in an attempt to discredit the work of
the Department and the Government work in general. It was either my
fortune or misfortune to meet in the field certain individuals who
in the most brazen way spoke to the officials and Indians assembled
in a disparaging way of those in authority as administrators in this
Department, but it was my satisfaction to see the Indians turn a deaf
ear and upbraid such attacks as were made. Nothing else has caused
the least annoyance.
The cooperation of the Office in our plans for more schools,
better schools, the initiation of club work, the establishment of
another hospital and in all affairs connected with the agency, is
most gratifying.
Mr. Homer L. Morrison, Chief Clerk, was directed to prepare a
report covering the year's work and it is submitted herewith.
It is hoped that the Annual Report for the year of 1926 can
record more progress among the Southern Pueblos than any previous
year and we realize that such progress can be made only through
most active effort upon the part of employees here, guided by care
ful consideration, and the cooperation of the office and the
Department.
