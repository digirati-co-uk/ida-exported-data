a further reduotion in income from stock raising. Heavy lonso.durine inter and spring wonths, lesser lemb crops, a furtherreduced wol elip, and inferior and stunted lambs to sell overyfell will eventually be the results. It is proposed to developwater by building reservoirs for the impounding of surface water,and the erilling of deep wells in artesian districta; this waterto be used for irrigation. The average Income per lepajo family1. by far lower than it should be, and if the present nunber ofetook i. maintained causing a further dopletion of the rangea,this income will be further reduced. It would, therefore, be wiseand consistent with good economy to reduce the number of sheepby which seeno the reages would recuperate from their presentstate of Lapovori shinent. To compensate for the supposedly reducednumber of sheep that could be marketed every fali, such ferningareas would provide a living for the Indians as a arnall acreageper family under intense cultivation would mean that they wouldbe assured of food throughout the year. It is believed thet sucha progru would offer a solution, at least in sone measure, to thepresent acerevated condition among the Revajo..Some range reconnaissanco has been carried on during thepast fiscal year, and it is proposed to continue that activityif the ranger can be released from other duties, A reconnaissancediscloses that it takes from ten to twelve acres per sheep toryear- round praxing to maintain the range on a sustained basis.The present ratio of five acros per sheep is decidedly destructiveutilisation,The present readjustment and consolidation of lands willhave beneficid effects on range utilization in the futuro. Sheneter time is available, further range studies and range managementplans will be carried over and perfected. It is contemplated topractice heavy culline of sheep and coats no as not to cause anabrupt chance in the number of enim ls that the Indians ora.WATER DEVELOPMENT:Two reservoirs are now in the process of constructioneast of Crownpoint, and it is hoped that at least one more bebuilt this year. These reservoirs are to be used for wateringlivestook. In order to effect proper distribution of weterineplaces and the proper running of sheep on the range, it is nocesseryto build upward of 150 additional reservoirs on this jurisdiction.It is hoped that money may be available to develop water forIrrigation in the near future. fall projects where soil andmoisture conditions are favorable would be cboden.
