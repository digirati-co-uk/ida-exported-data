ALLOTMENTS.
To date 3,670 allotments have been made that are in good
standing; waliotted 3,583, the majority of which are entitled
to allotment; total Indian population living upon the public Domain
under this jurisdiction 7,253, with over 300 more living upon the
eastern part of the Navajo reservation proper and under this
jurisdiction.
The Indian Office has thought best to discontinue the allot
ment of land to Indians upon the public Domain until such a time
as purchase and exchange can be consummated. The allotment work
has been carried on under the General Allotment Act as amended
on June 25, 1910. The consolidation should be effected at the
earliest possible date and the work of allotment should be con
tinued. Consolidation of lands either by purchase or exchange
can only be effective within the checkered- board area and which is
owned by the Atlantic& Pacific Railroad Company and the New
Mexico& Arizona Land Company, but there is no possible way to
protect the Indians in their rights beyond the fifty mile limit
of this railroad land, and in our opinion, the allotment work
beyond that limit should proceed until finished as they can only
be protected in this way unless an extension of the reservation
can be made and such a movement will cause an open fight by the
people in the state of New Mexico.
The following number of acres have been purchased in the
last two years for the benefit of the Nava jos: At Ramah 8,960
acres at a cost of$ 12,800.00 and 42,099.71 acres were purchased
from the Atlantic Pacific Company at a cost of$ 1.00 per acre,
and recently deeds have been prepared and submitted by the
New Mexico& Arizona Land Company for their holdings in Township
16, Range 15, covering all odd- numbered sections and nearly ten
sections in the township immediately south, Town 15, Range 15;
an approximate total of 19,000 acres at a cost of$ 2.00 per acre,
and the Atlantic Pacific Company have recently reconveyed two
townships immediately north of Crown Point, something more than
23,000 acres and which is now held in trust by the Indian Depart
ment for the benefit of the Navajo Indians and which will remedy
in a small way some of our range problems, al though each locality
is fully ocoupied by Indians and only protects them in the range
they are now using, but this is a mere beginning compared with
what should be done for these people.
