Section IV---
· INDUSTRIES.( Cont' a).
Fencing is found on lands used for farmi ng purposes.
Occasionally small houses are found thereon but as a rule
the Indians live in their pueblos and go out to the farms
to work. None of the land is allotted.
10. No land on the reservation is leased.
It is not advisable to lease any land. The Indians
need for their own use all the land on the reservation,
In fact they lease for their use considerable land out
side of the reservation,

Stock is improving in quality, 8 specially the
-- sheep and horses. It is not increasing in mumber.
( b).
Losses of stock on the reservation during the
year hayebeen slight, comparatively speaking.
Indians are feeding their work horses much
more than formerly during the winter. All other
stock depend on the range for subsistence during
the entire year. As a rule they do fairly well.
( a)
The future outlook for she epraising is very
encouraging. Cattleraising impresses us as not
profitable, peet or future. There are several reasons
for this. Most of the Indians quit giving much
attention to cattleraising ten years ago,
They have given attention to improvement of their
she ep instead and have profited by it.
The presence of stock of white men on the reser
vation is very detrimental to the interests of the
Indian. We are bothered considerably in this way.
The stock eat grass needed for Indian stock and
break into fields of crops belonging to Indians,
tta doing considerable damage to the crops. I do
not know what policy should be pursued in this mat
ter in the future. The opinion of the Office would
be appreciated.

The indians are utilizing all the range on the
reservation and rent ing range, to a considerable ex
tent, outside of the reservation
The number of high grade sires is not sufficient.
However, the number is increasing from year to year.
The se Indians have no tribal herd.
