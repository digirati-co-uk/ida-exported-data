1111Hopi villages on high mesas. Originally these people were enemiesand on occasions( especially during dry spel18), this old ermitybecomes evident, largely owing to insufficient quantities of waterfor stock. Stock depredations and petty grievances are legion.The Navajos, whenever they think it likely to go unobserved andunpunished, make raids upon the Hopi fields and stock. A thoroughdescription of this situation was placed before the Indian Officein a report dated June 22, 1914, answering a report made bySuperintendent H. F. Robinson,( Irrigation Service), with respect tosuch conditions and demand for a remedy. The Superintendent whenin Washington requested that an investigation of this situation bemade, which eventually resulted in the one held by Inspector H. S.Traylor. In May 1916 a council was held with representativeNavajo Indians at Keams Canon, Arizona, and other councils held withHop 18 at the various mesas. Reference is made to the report of theInspector with respect to all such matters concerning jurisdiction,boundaries, range and necessity for increased water development, andadditional schools to accommoda te the large Navajo population thatat present has no school facilities. It is believed that theInspector agreed that such Indians should be provided with schoolsin their immediate country, as it is not likely that efforts towardsending their children to non- reservation schools will meet with anymore success than heretofore.5
