There is also a Mission Boarding School at Farmington under the direct
ion of the Methodist Mission with a capacity of 80 pupils. There are approximate
ly 250 pupils in non- reservation and public schools. There are also eight net
Day Schools now under construction which are as follows:
Denehotso
Rockpoint
Tees- nos- pos
Declabito
Red Rock
Cove
Burnhams
Aneth
Capacity 100-120

It is also planned to increase the capacity of both Sanostee and Nava
to four rooms each making them 100-120 pupils capacity. This will give reservation
schools a capacity of 1500 pupils. If the Day School construction program of
proposed schools is completed, the potential capacity will be well over 2000
children. The planned re- organization will subdivide the jurisdiction into sever
al community districts which will probably be under the charge of community agents
who will in turn be under the jurisdiction of the administrator.
At the present time there are two hospitals on this reservation. One
at Shiprock, which formerly had a capacity of 60 beds, was reduced to 45 beds by
Dr. L. R. White; and the hospital at Toadlena which had a capacity of 20 beds but
was reduced to 12. Both hospitals are over crowded even on the old capacity basis.
Consistent requests for new hospitals and sanitoriums which would provide at least
100 additional beds have been made to your office. It is felt that if a new 100
bed generel hospital could be built that the present old hospital could be used
for some time as a tubercular sanitorium. With the present set- up it is very unsat
isfactory both to the Navajos and the medical personnel. Practically all the time
there is a long waiting list- Navajos who should have hospital treatment. It is
impossible for the doctor to explain why such a condition exists and very often the
confidence of the Indian is shaken by the doctor's statement that there is no room
for him in the hospital and he will have to wait until space is available.
No. 1. Industrial Development and Welfare and Social Conditons.
( a) Industrial development:
During 1934, or since ECW and PWA have been available, a great
development program has been undertaken and it is felt that results have been
most gratifying, both from the standpoint of production and human betterment.
ECW has produced in the way of improvements approximately 200 miles of truck and
horse trails, 300 reservoirs, springs and dug wells. 16 deep wells, 150 miles of
fencing, 35,000 acres of rodent eradication. Two Soil Erosion projects, 1 million
board feet of lumber of ECW projects, considerable fire control work and many
other small projects. This work has employed from 300 to 1200 Indians almost
