5.so that the Indians occupying the western or added portion night be enabled to plant in Moencopie Wash.There is ample land down said wash,adjoining the Moencopie Indian Allotments, occupied by whites( Mormons)that is under irrigation, that would provide fields for a large numberof Indians to plant, and should the improvements of the said whitesettlers be purchased by the Government and they vacate their locationsas is contemplated in the report hereinbefore referred to, which I intend to submit tomorrow, it would, in my opinion, be better to leaveall the lands in Moencopie Wash unallotted for the purpose above stated,as the surrounding country, including the valley of said wash wherenot irrigated, is not adapted to agriculture, and produces nothing butsmall grease- wood, sage- brush and bunch- grass roots, the latter beingvery nutritious but so sparsely distributed that it requires severalacres to subsist a sheep.The allotment of lands in any portion of the Navajo or Moquireservations, west of Kean's Canon, is, in my Judgunent unadvisable, forthe reason that the country referred to is chiefly a vast sandy desert,the sands shifting with every wind storm, as is evidenced at Oraibi Mesawhere the soil of a number of the allotments that were made to Indiansby Special Agent mayhugh in 1892, has been carried away by the winds,leaving nothing but barren sand rock.Mr. Peter Staufer now missionionary at Oraibi under theauspices of the Menonite Mission,who was formerly employed as Reservation Mechanic for the Moquis and was thus employed at the SecondMoqui Mesa in 1892 when allotments were made at Oraibi, stated to methat he regarded the allotment of lands around the Moqui Mesas at thetime they were being made as absurd and still so regards themforthe reason that the Indians plant in the sand flats, which sands in dryseasonsare shifted by the winds and the Indians following their sandto plant in, many of their fields are now from a quarter of a mile toa mile distant from where allotments were made to them.Mr. Stauferpointed out to me several places where allotments had been made, wherethe sands have been carried off and nothing but barren flat surface
