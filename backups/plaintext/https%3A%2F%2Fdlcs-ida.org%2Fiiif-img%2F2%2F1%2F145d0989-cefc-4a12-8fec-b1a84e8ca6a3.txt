( 29)WOOL:For the wool sold during 1920, the Laguna and Ao ome Indiansreceived a pproximately 184 and 16to per pound.Local influencesaffected the 1921 sale, in that Acome Indians showed little interestin a wool pool, and went back to the ancient and foolish custom ofselling individually to local Indian traders.It was reported thatmany of them received not more than 7 Â° per pound, and it is verydoubtful if such a price was augmented later.Even some few LagunaIndians drifted away from the pool;but the larger number of Lagunasremained convinced that pooling, and selling in bulk through theSuperintendent( a system inaugurated by former Supt.P.T.Lonergan) wasfor their best interests.Themarket was not inviting, and anadvanceof 94 per pound was offered by large wool dealers.A localIndian trader( unlicensed) offered 984 with no guarantee that suchfigure would not represent an outright sale, and it was rejected.My Wool Report, dated November 2, 1921, showed that the Laguna poolcovered 71, 790 pounds in the grease, which scoured 25,121 pounds, ashrinkage of 65%. This was a slightly larger shrinkage than for the1920 wool. The advance of 94 per pound was finally supplemented by$ .06521 per pound, a total of$ .15521 for 1921 wool.The cattle, horse, sheep and goat stock of the Pueblos are heldindividually.The lands are held under the communal system, and theagricultural areas are controlled and apportioned by the Pueblo
