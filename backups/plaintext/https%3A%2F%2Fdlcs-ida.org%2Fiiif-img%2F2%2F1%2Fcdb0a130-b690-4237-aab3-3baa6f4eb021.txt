Annual Roport. 1916.
Bokool
There are no public sohools near enough for the Navahoz
children to attend, though 11 a school building is built at Croma
Point by the district, several Navaho children will attond during
the next school year. The average attandendo in the regular board
ing school foro was( 125). This average is low on account of the
two new dormitories not being ready for pupils until about the
holidays
.
The olass- room industrial work has in the main been very
satisfactory. Instruction has been given in various industrial de
partments as mentioned in last years roport.
The position of weaver
has been added for next year and special instruction in this art
will be given during next year.
Our band under the leadership of a returned student has made
fine progress and many favorable comments have been made by many
people who have heard them and they gave a good account of them
selves while at the State Fair last year.
At the farm the water from two artesian wells is stored in a
rosevoir and used for irrigation purposes.
twelve to fifteen
acres of alfalfa was planted last year and the greater part of it is
doing very well.
At least three crops will be cut from this during
the present season. Last year through improper methods of irrigation
but little returns were received from the farm. This season since
the rainy season has set in it seems probable that we will raise at
least 35 tons of hay, considerable corn and a variety of vegetables.
35 acres have beon put in cultivation and the managemont and care
under a competent farmer this year permits our boys to have efficient
training in sucossful farming.
