36- HopiEDUCATION:If the office succeeds in getting us the funds we willbuild another boarding school plant like the one here now, forNavajo children out of school, and place in it all our eligibleNevajo children.One such plant has been recormended and will takecare of these school children nicely i≈ø built for about 250 capacity.The Navajos want a boarding school and not a day school. This theyare very definite about.We will not have funds for many improvements thiscoming fiscal year but will do considerable to improve our dayschools for Hopis and transfer the surplus to outside schools. Atpresent we have about a thousand children from this reservation inoutside schools. We hope to carry the sixth grade in all these dayschools as soon as we have the teaching force to do this.We have been allowed an additional elementary teacherfor our boarding school and that will allow us to do much betterwork here and get all our pupils in school for the full day. Thiswill be important, and an impetus to better results with our children..We found last year that by adding Home Economics to ourboarding school it helped our work and the older children a greatdeal. We have planned for 1932 a stronger and better H. E. department,with more efficient and modern equipment.The Community Work feature of all our schools will befurther emphasized the coming year, as well as our Indian Art Work.These two features have been very prominent here and are commentedon by all visitors. The shop work, or industrial work, will beimproved considerably through better quarters for such instructionand better equipment already purchased.We have found that by allowing our students to competein all kinds of exhibitions for school children's work it adds pepand ginger to their local school work, so we lose no opportunity toenter our work in all such exhibits strictly for the benefit ofthe Indians.With double our water capacity this coming year we canand will bathe oftener, operate our laundry without shutting downnow and then, and otherwise be able to improve our school workgenerally.
