It is believed that some consideration should be given to
the means provided a Superintendent for the accomplishment of
the expected work, and the Moqui Agency pay- roll will show that
since June it has been and is fifty per cent deficient in
employe8. I wish to state that for some time past at least
sixteen hours out of each 24 have been steadily devoted by me
to reservation busine88, and this is considerably more than the
eight hours indicated by the regulations. An honest ondeavor ha 8
been made to meet this exigenoy, and that without complaint, but
when such a shortage in help affects the office and clericai forco,
some department must suffer, and the activities of the reservation
( without which there would be no reason to report) cannot be
permitted to suffer.
This grind has become so wearing that only recently, expecting
to shortly finish the reports called for, I requested an approval
of anmel leave, since I have had none this year and none last
year. All other employes of the reserve are accommodated in
this respect, and seven years' experienco in the Indian Office
inclines me to believe that few are denied there. Unless there
18 some relief at hand soon, it is likely that a period of idlo
ness in bed will be one of the morced penalties.
Respectfully submitted.
Krone
Superintendent.
