As to cutting a clothes- room
f'rom the proposer plav- room as shown int
Sentative sketch
.It seems to me to be a bad plan from the fact that
however large this school may
become this
18 x 50
feet or 900 sq.
ft.
is all the real play room that
can ever be allowed these girls
And I submit
il even with 100 girls
which number we are sure to have
within two months from now, is nine hundred square feet too much play
room
1. have made a succinct statement of
my reasons for
advocating such
a building as I propose
I have done this
with
what I consider the
proper sprit for a subordinate officer to
make statements to his
supsrior. I have triod to make my position clear and to give good
reasons
ror wishing that the building may be constructed and arran
ged as I propose but what ever orders and suggestions you may make
will be
faithfully and promptly cllowed.
I will attech
statement of
just what part of the building I wish
done by contract what part of the material I wish to buy in the oper
market and just what part or the construction I wish to do with the
school force,
As our carpenter has not yet reportad, and as I have no
funds to pay an archetect
to prepare
farther plans and
specificatis
I would respectfully request that you have the necessary
papers pre
pared in your office. I send
sketches by this mail under separate
cover.
I am, very respectfully,
Your obedient DNAnt
