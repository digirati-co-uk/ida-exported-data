P
hundred Navajo men and women are here at these meetings and every
thing that the office suggests or writes about, affecting the
interests of these Indians, is taken up with the Indians
present so that all may know what we have in mind, what the office
wants, and the whys and wherefors. I even read all the letters of
importance to these Indians. At this council any member may take
up any grievance or any punishment may be meted out by the chief
and headmen. This council has been a big aid to me this year and
there is a general friendly co- operation all over the Navajo country
because of this attitude on the part of the agency. It makes the
Indians think they have a good and important part in conducting their
own affairs and something to say about how things should go. I
encourage the women to attend these meetings and let them take part
equally, in every way, with the men, They vote as do the men. It
costs something to feed these people once every month, but the
results for the Government far exceeds any cost and by having these
Indians come in once a month many costly miles of traveling is
saved for employees.
The water supply for the school, sardens, trees, etc., is
still greatly inadequate and must be considered soon. The Irrigation
Service has suggested a way to get all the surplus water now
coming down the Keams Canon Wash and this should be put into their
hands and they given enough toney to make this improvement.
that, or well must be drilled some place near.
I want to thank the Office for its assistance, in many
ways, during a very trying and enervating year here. It was appreci
ated by all the employees, especially those of the Health Dept.
Very respectfully,
