If youendeavor to achieve, it will happen given enough resolve. Itmay not be immediate, and often your greater dreams aresomething you will not achieve within your own lifetime. Theeffort you put forth to anything transcends yourself, for thereis no futility even in death. ” Monty Oum.Robert Johnson92
