Dataing, N. Mox
Dear sir:
As I protai sed you in n\ tuar of some tw**, I will writo
to you.
Our cook 16 about to lewe um, and of courad tie makes a
vacanci in our kitchon.
I have talked to no mumbers of the Mose
about you, and this is what they say. They all 14k you and your work,
and would like you back at the prica and toms you maom tion in your
letter, but they insist at you must stop swearing in the kitchen or
any where else about the place, also that you must be respectfuly to
Miss Witmer, never forgetting that she is a lady and must be traatad
accordingly. Further, you can not have any boys to help with your
work. You can hire a boy to build tires for you in the morning, out
not to work for you during the dy. The Com vill ho delivered by the
side of the kitchen whore it belongs. I write you this plainly so that
there may be ne misunderstanding in the future. I can give you a room
for yourselt here at the schabl, but as Mr. Borrego has the whole of the
bause you used to live in, you will have to make arrangements with him
if you bring your family from tom.
Very truts yours.
Superintendenta
