Cut in a curve shape inthe ear. I believe this a rather cruel way, but at the same time isthe safest and best way that a brand can be carried by the sheep aslong as a person would own it. I have seen how traders, when theybuy sheep from the Indians, mark them on their backs with blackor red paint. But this kind of brand can only stay on the sheep' sback up to the time the sheep is shorn.Dipping the sheep is not only a means of making the wool whitebefore shearing, but it also tends to keep the sheep from getting anykind of disease or sheep- bugs. These are important points to belooked after if the shepherd cares anything about his sheep. If neglected it will mean a great deal of loss in his flock due to his owncarelessness. For this reason sheep dips are built by the governmentso that any shepherd may dip his sheep.Shearing the sheep will prove ho wa shepherd has been caringfor his sheep. The shearing is done the latter part of April or thefirst part of May. My tribe has not taken as great an interest in theproper manner of shearing, or care of the wool, as I would like tohave them do. I have seen them shear their sheep right in the dirtwhere the wool comes in contact with the small particles of dirt. Ibelieve this has something to do with the wool value. Dirty wool doesnot bring as good a price as clean wool. They should pick a cleanplace to shear the sheep and place a canvas under him in order tokeep the wool clean.My people tie the sheep' s front and hind legs together so theshearing man or woman won' t be kicked over by the sheep, and sothe sheep won' t get away from the shearing person when it is halfsheared.The sheep must be provided with plenty of grass and water andthese must not be too far apart. The sheep should not be requiredto walk too far to water.The young lambs must be protected from wild animals such ascoyotes and wolves. For this purpose shepherd dogs are of greathelp to the shepherd, and they also keep the lambs from strayingaway from the rest of the flock. Many shepherds place their sheepin a strong corral at night. These corrals should be built on an elevated piece of ground in order that the water will drain from it inevery direction.lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIl-||-11||--|llllllllll----lllllllllllll-111-|--|-|-ーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミー|-|-|--|-|-||-|-|-|-----|---|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|--|-|--|-|--|-|Fol-|-|-|--|-Page Thirty- eight
