C.Dear Sir:Referring to Office letter of August 2, 1929it is explained that the hospital report, as such,did not show any Home Service to Indians, but thatthe figure covering such service was reserved forthe agency statistical report and shown on that report.This service was performed by our physician who,aside from the Field Nurse, is the only medicalemployee to make these long reservation drives andperform such outside service as distinguished frompurely hospital service.thAUG 27 1929As there appears to be no other place inagency report to show such class of medical service,we do not know where else to show the item. Showing iton the hospital report also would appear to be aduplication, This service is correctly shown on theagency statistical section,Very respectfully,a GorsedBC. A.
