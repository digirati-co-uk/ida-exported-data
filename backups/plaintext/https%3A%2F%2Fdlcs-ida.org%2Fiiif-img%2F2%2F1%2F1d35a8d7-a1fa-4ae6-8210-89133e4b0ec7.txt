Section 3- Continued..... â€¢ Sohool.graduatingclass to remain and strengthen their work incertain subjects before deliveringto them their diplomas.This school had a short summer term with only one teacherin charge last year. It is believed a great deal of benefitwill result from the summer term.We are convinced that eleven years should be devotedto the completion of the ten grades of the course of study.It is my opinion and I believe the opinion of the Principalof this school that three years should be devoted to thefifth and sixth grades. If this is done we find ourpupils are able to complete the other grades with satisfactory strength. The fifth and sixth grades are ratherextensive and difficult for the Indian pupils. We areinclined to follow this plan in the future if such a coursedoes not meet with disapproval on the part of the Office orthe Chief Supervisor.Expendituresfor the fiscal years 1923 and appropriations for 1924:19231924For support and education of500 pupils-( 600 pupils for$ 100, 000. 120, 000.1924)9, 000.General repairs and improvementsIncluding constructionofsleeping porches for 192435, 000.Indian School, Albuquerque, N.
