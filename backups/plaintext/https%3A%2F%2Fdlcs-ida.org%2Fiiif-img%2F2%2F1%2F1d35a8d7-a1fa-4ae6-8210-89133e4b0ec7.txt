graduating
class to remain and strengthen their work in
certain subjects before delivering
to them their diplomas.
This school had a short summer term with only one teacher
in charge last year. It is believed a great deal of benefit
will result from the summer term.
We are convinced that eleven years should be devoted
to the completion of the ten grades of the course of study.
It is my opinion and I believe the opinion of the Principal
of this school that three years should be devoted to the
fifth and sixth grades. If this is done we find our
pupils are able to complete the other grades with satisfac
tory strength. The fifth and sixth grades are rather
extensive and difficult for the Indian pupils. We are
inclined to follow this plan in the future if such a course
does not meet with disapproval on the part of the Office or
the Chief Supervisor.
