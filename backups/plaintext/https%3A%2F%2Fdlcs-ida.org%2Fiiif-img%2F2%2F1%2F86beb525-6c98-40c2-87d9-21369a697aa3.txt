times and seen many people come and go. I realized how much this place
was my home when I left; I missed everyone from the teachers to the
students. Norma, I will always cherish the friendship and bond we had

Wow, I guess now I can say that I made i. High
Schools already over! It' s kind of a relief, but then
really thinking about it, I' m going to miss it. I' m
going to miss all the friends that i made and the new
people I have met. The teachers, of my junior and
senior year, I am going to miss the most because they
have all helped encourage me in everyway, and to get
to where I am today. Thank you SFIS. Class of' 09!'
