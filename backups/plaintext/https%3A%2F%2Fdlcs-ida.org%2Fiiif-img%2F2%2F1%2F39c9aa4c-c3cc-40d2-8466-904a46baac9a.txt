IW. T. THORNTON,GOVERNORExecutiveDepartmentTERRITORY OF NEW MEXICO.Sept. 7th, 1894.Santa Fe, N. M.,189.Sir;I have the honor to call your attention to the matter of appropriation for the development of water upon the Navajo Reservavion, and the manner of its expenditure in the interest of the people of this Territory. I feel very grealy interested in this appropriation, and that it shall be expended in a way to insure thegreatest benefit to this tribe of Indians. This is not only necessary for the support of these indians, but it is absolutely necessary for the protection of our citizens who occupy the adjacent landsupon whom the Indians depredate, when the conditions are such thatthey are unable to support themselves on the Reservation. I am induced to call this matter to your attention at this time. Information has reached me from various sources which I consider to bereliable, that, this appropriation is being wasted by an incompetentSuperintendent. I am told that Mr. B. C. Vincent, who is in chargeis very incompetent, is no surveyor, and has no knowledge whateverof irrigation; and that owing to his poor health, he has not theenergy or strength to manage this business; that he has been on theReservation since Ap il, and has not, up to this time, securedthe necessary tools and implements to perform this work; that hehas only constructed about 400 yards of a ditch, which has beendone entirely with the tools of the Indians. In view of this condud,I most earnestly request that he be removed from this position, andsome competent person be p t in his place. It is an easy ma terto get a man who is a good engineer, and one who understands irrigationand the control of men, for the salary which is paid for this work.Hoping the Department will investigate this matter..., and if myinformation proves correct, that the desired change will be made, Iremain,very respectfully,HonorableCommissionerIndian Affairs,Washington, D. C.Yoorruor,W1 Thornton
