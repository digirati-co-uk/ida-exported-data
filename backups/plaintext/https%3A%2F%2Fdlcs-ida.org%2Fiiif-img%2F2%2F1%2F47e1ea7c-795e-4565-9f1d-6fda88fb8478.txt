Mr. H. D. Rankin
,
Watrous, N.M.
In reply to your letter of the 16th instant, I have to say
the we have never been prepared to receive 100 re than two days supply
meat at one time, but on consultation with the Matron and Cook, they
6.rs willing to try it twice a week and if this will not do we can after
varde change it,
We now need only about 140 pounds a day as the school'is on vaca
lion, but later on we shall probabiy need twice that amount, but as the
weathe will then be cooler we can receive it twice a week without any
difficult
I know of several transter men in town but who will be the best
to attend to the delivery I cannot say, but until this is arranged
I can have it hauled to the school by the Indians at the same price
the delivery wagons charge; the price to be fixed after you have rec
ceived bids from transter mon in town.
You can ship by refrigerator
-as stated in your letter on Thurs
day and Sunday, so that the beer would be received horo on Friday's
and wonday's. You should ship about 560 pounds Fridays, and 420 pounds
