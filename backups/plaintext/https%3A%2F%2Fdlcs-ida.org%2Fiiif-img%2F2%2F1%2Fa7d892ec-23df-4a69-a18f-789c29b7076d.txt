OUR NEWSPAPER

written on the board with the name of the contributor. At the end
of the month, the class selected the best items both from a stand
point of interest and good English. These were typed and a heoto
graphed copy was given each child.
The names of the reporters were put in each monthly issue,
arranged in the order of frequency of contributions.
