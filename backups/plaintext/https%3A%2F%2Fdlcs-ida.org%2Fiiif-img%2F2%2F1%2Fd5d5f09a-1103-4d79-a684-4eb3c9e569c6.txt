search of private dwellings and other places could be modified,
particularly when we have every reason to believe that the
party occupying the premises is engaged in the manufacture and
sale of liquor. We have had no success in getting cases tried
under the old law prohibiting the sale of liquor to Indians or
the introduction
of liquor into the Indian territory. Although
we have filed cases under this law, they have always been charged
and tried under the Vols tead Act and if conviction is had a
light penalty is inflicted. A heavier penalty for violation of
the Volstead Act would certainly be beneficial. From our ob
servation, we are satisfied that National prohibition has not
decreased the traffic in intoxicating liquors in this section
of the country. Both Indians and Whites seem to be able to get
intoxicating liquor when ever they desire.
The operation of sawmills on the Reservation, which often brings
in laborers who are somewhat below par in morals, presents an
opportunity for Mexicans and Indians to gamble. However, CO
operation from the ones in charge of the mills has reduced the
gambling to the minimum.. From statements of people who have been
among the Apache for many years, there has been a decided improve
ment so far as gambling is concerned during the past eight or ten
years. Formerly, they had nothing to do and idleness always
brings discontent with its other vices.
No important decisions affecting these Indians have been made
by State or Federal courts during the fiscal year and we know
of no State legislation enacted during the year affecting the
liquor traffic or other activities under this jurisdiction.
