Or MinualGARHOPEFIVIDJUL 2 1 1910AGRICULTURE/Much time has been spent during the past year indeveloping and improving the department of agriculture. Althoughall Indians will not become farmers, we believe that, on accountof the fact that all own land and most of them live in agriculturalregions, many will follow this pursuit. I do not subscribe tothe doctrine that the only salvation for our Indians is to makefarmers of them all, any more than I accept a similar polioywith regard to the education of whites. This statement ismade advisedly, because more than half of our graduates areearning a living entirely away from the reservation, and out ofa total of 515 graduates only 54 are engaged in farming. Thereis no reason based on practical experience why an Indian shouldnot become a good carpenter, bricklayer, blacksmith, or painter,and find remunerative employment, as to become a successfulfarmer. Nevertheless, because of the fact that so many of theIndians will necessarily choose farming as a means of gaining alivelihood, it is incumbent on our schools to give practicaltraining along this lineThrough the co- operation of the United States Departmentof Agriculture and the Pennsylvania State Department of Agriculture, our farm and dairy are being systematically developedand improved, so that every young man who chooses farming as avocation can, at Carlisle, receive thorough instruction in dowm.to- date methods and in the fundamental principles of this subjectThe students are also taught how to meet and solve the crude conditions at their homes.
