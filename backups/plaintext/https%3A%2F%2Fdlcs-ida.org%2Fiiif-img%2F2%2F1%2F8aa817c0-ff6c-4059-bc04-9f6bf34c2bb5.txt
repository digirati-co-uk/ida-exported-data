the honor
to inform
you
that
we are having
an epidemic
or
easies
at the school
age that
the hospitat
is at present
filled
with
patients
and no doubt
will
continue
so for some
time, as there
Sr new cases
appearing
every
day.
Many of the patients
are very sick
and it is absolutely
inposs
ibl. for them
to eat the regular
school
rations
, and the physician
rongly
urges
me to provide
other
food for some of them, therefore
I respectfully
request
authority
to expend
a sum not exceeding
$ 25.00
or so much thereof
as may be necessary
, in the open market
purchase
of
edibles
other
than the ordinary
school
rations
, as delicacies
for
these
sick pupils
.
Very respectfully
