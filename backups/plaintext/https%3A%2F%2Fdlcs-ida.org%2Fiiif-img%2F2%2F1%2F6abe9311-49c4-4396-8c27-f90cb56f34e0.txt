Dear sirs:
The steam mangle I purchased from you on August 13th,
1891, and about which I complained
of the poor quality afterwards
,
has again br√≥ker, making all together$ 22.30 expense for repairing
it these three times.
The bill for the last repairs which
amount to$ 8.00, I will inclose herewith.
I think there is no
reason to doubt that this breakage was due to defective material
in the mangle rollar, and that tor that reason you should bear
the expense this time,
We have used the mangle carefully, and
put no strain upon it which should break it.
Very respectfully
yours,
Heard
Superinterdert
