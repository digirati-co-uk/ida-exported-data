Health
Annual Report
1917
San Juan School and Agency.
The general health conditions at the school and agency
have been unusually good the past year.
There were no deaths.
Tuberculosis and trachoma prevail as heretofore.
An epidemic
of chickenpox made its appearance on the reservation during
the winter and there were a number of cases of it at the school
with no serious results. Smallpox made its appearance on the
reservation near the close of the year. Prompt measures were
taken to protect the Indians through vaccination. For the
present, the disease seems to be dying out rapidly. There
were no cases at the school.
There has been no marked improvement in the condition
of Indian homes on the reservation during the past year.
The new saw mill above Toadlena, now completed, will
provide lumber for use in building Indian homes at a reasonable
price, and the next few years should see a very appreciable
improvement in the character of Indian homes on this reser
vation.
Anything like a regular sanitary inspection of living
conditions on the reservation has been impossible with the
1 imited force of employees available for this purpose. As
muchas possible has been done along this line, however.
