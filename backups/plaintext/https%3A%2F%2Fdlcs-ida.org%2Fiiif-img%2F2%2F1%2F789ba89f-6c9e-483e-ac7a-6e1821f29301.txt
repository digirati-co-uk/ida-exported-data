Miss Lillian A. Larsen,
Warrenton, Oregon,
Dear Miss I.arsen:-
Being informed by one of my pupils that you are de
sirous
of entering the Santa Fe Indian Normal School, I take the op
portunity to inform you
that I will be very glad
to enroll you as a
pupil of this school.
I will write my agent, Mr. Harry Throssell, who is now in your C
tion of the country solicitating pupils, informing him to furnish you
with transportation from your starting point to Santa Fe providing you
coming
are ready to start. I would rather have all pupils from your sec
tion of the country to come with mr. Throssell if it is possible, but
should you be unable to do 80 I will be glad to furnish you transpor
tation later on, not however, to go beyond September, 1899.
Hoping to hear from you soon, I am,
Yours very truly,
ان/////
superintendent,
W.DM.
