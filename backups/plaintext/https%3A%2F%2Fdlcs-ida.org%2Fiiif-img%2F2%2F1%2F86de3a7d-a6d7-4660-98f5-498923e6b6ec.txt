other a hug for a job well done. Marching to another
performance, Brave Spirit Band moves forward. Theresa,

The Brave Spirit Band is having its best year ever.
1982- 83 started with band camp in August, where
members got rigorous training at the hands of David
Jesion and Steve Scharder from N. M. S. U., and Roland
Villa. Then our band won third place in the State
Fair Parade. They also went to Phoenix to play with
the Phoenix Indian School Band. S. F. I. S. is proud of
its band and of Roland Villa, who makes it all
happen!
