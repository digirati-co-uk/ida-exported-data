The total expenditure for all purposes during the fiscal yearended June 30, 1927 was fifty thousand, five hundred eighty- eightdollars and thirty- three cents, while the total expenditure for thefiscal year ended June 30, 1928 was fifty- eight thousand six hundredsixty- one dollars and one cont. The increase in expenditure was dueto the fact that our enrollment was increased, the number of ourschools has been increased and the number of grades in our variousschools has been increased.Most of our schools are equipped with some playground apparatusand it is being used to a good advantage where it is in good repair,but this equipment is badly worn in some cases and repeir parts cannot be secured. Systematic supervision is being given to all playground activities in the day schools. The boys and girls are allabout the same age and most of them between the ages of six andtwelve, therefore they use the same playground and same playgroundequipment to a very great extent. It does not seem possible atthis time to make any reasonable estimate as to how long the Government schools should be continued in this jurisdiction. The Indians of the pueblo country are a peculiar problem and the statusof the Indian citizen in the State of New Mexico will have to befurther defined by Federal statutes and amendments to the Stateconstitution before there can be any reasonable hope of placing theschools who√§ly under the jurisdiction of the State.
