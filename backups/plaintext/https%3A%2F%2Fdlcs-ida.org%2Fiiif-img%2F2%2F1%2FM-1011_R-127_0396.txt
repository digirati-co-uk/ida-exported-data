Annual Report, 1926
San Juan Agency
At the request
of the Superintendent
, Mir. W. H
Hashbarger
, who has been principal of the Toadlena School
for the past six years, has prepared a report covering
conditions at that
school, which report follows:
lost pleasant
relationship
has ex
isted between the local public school and
this institution
through- out the year. This
public school has enrolled nine Navajo
pupils and the white and Indian pupils
get
along together pleasantly
. The teacher has
been especially
tactful in handling a mixed
school
The Chief Supervisor
, the District
Supervisor, and Inore recently the Super
visor of Fiela Nurses and Field Matrons has
called attention
to the need of a steam
cooker, a bread mixer, and a vegetable parer.
The school farm
seems to be developing
slow
1y and there is no pressing need of further
i arm equipment except for a small horse
pow
er hay press in order that hey may be balad
for hauling down the mountain to the school.
One additional employee, a trained nurse
( with possibly an assistant) will be needed
when the hospital is completed. We do not
know when this hospital will be ready for
use. It was planned to convert the cottage
built by H. J. Hagernen when
he was Cornmis
sioner to the Navajo Tribe into quarters
for
the Principal and to convert the cottage here
tofore used as quarters for the Brigcipal
into a hospital. The work on the Hagerman
cottage was completed
and the Principal and
his family noved
in in late April, the work
on the other cottage was well begun but had
to be discontinued
because of lack of funds.
This work should be resumed at the earliest
possible monent. The
Toadlena school also
needs a nightwatchman
. Things have gone reas on
Ebly well without a nightwatch
for many years
but such an employee
would be valuable in
guarding life and property and preventing
unauthorized
persons
from corning about the
school at night. There are but four teachers
