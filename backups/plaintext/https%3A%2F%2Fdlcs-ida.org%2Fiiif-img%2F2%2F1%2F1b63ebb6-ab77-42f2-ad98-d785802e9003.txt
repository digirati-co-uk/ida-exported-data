What is there to do? For starters, you
can get back to the days of playing
dirt road games on the rez. Or you
can chill at the EAC. Maybe shoot a
little pool or get in some Guitar Hero.
How about catch some Native dances
out on the plaza? A little powwow?
FRYBREAD, YEAH!!!! Even catch
some goodies during the Pueblo
throw. You just gotta have fun!
