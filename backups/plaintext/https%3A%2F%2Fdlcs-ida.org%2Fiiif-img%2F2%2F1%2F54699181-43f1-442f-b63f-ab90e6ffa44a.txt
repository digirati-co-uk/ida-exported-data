Field Irrigation.
Annual Report

San Juan School& Agency
Irrigation water from the San Juan River is secured by
appropriation and use.
It is my understanding that legal filing
was made several years ago for 67.63 cubic feet of water.
Irrigation work under this jurisdiction has been carried
on for several years past under the supervision of Superintendent
of Irrigation Robinson, with headquarters at Albuquerque, New
Mexico.
The Hogback canal project has been in direct charge of
Engineer E. C. Gersbach.
