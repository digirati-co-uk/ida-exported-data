Replying to your letter of the 20th inst. in reference io desks
for the isleta day school, I would respectfully state that on November
16 I requested the indian office to furnish this school*** 94 Sottees
to be used in fuinisking the new hall and for recitation seats.
The necessi.
At this writing, I have not heard from that request.
y of this purchase is so obvious that I am sure that I will soon re
ceive the Settees,
In case the Settees are allowed, I can furnish you
not far from 40. desks of assorted sizes, and shall be more than glad to
OSO.
But if the Settees are not furnished, I must use every thing on
At presant the small seats are
the place that will holl a child,
xaise upon blocks and used as audience room seats.
Hoping that the Department will furnish the Settees as ask ad for
and that I may be able to accommodate you,
hai to chairs, we have not more than hall enough for our present
neede.
I am, very respectfully,
allt
Superintendent,
