Since a greater number of families stay on their
farms in the outer villages, the greater part of the
year, it would encourage more permanent homes on the
farms if there were day schools at the outer villages.
With all the schools in the main Zuni village, it is
necessary for the families to move back from the t' arms
during the school months. It makes it difficult for
those to harvest their crops in the fall and to do
early spring planting. A survey of the number of child
ren of school age in the villages at Ojo Caliente and
Nutria justifies the erection of small day schools in
these most prosperous and thickly settled villages.
