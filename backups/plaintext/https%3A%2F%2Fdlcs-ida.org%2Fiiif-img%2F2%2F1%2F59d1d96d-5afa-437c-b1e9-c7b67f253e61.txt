" Industries"
Very few of these Indians leave the immediate vicinity in search of
work. The majority that do go out to work are working for the Santa Fe Railroad
Company, either in the Roundhouse at Winslow, or as section hands at different
points along the Railroad, and are making a very creditable showing. It is not
necessary to render any assistance to these Indiens in finding employment.
Each pueblo has its own local Government, consisting of Governor, Lieut
enant Governor, and Councilmen. They handle all matters pretaining to the pueblo
and, as a rule, conduct their meetings in a business- like manner. The main
objection to this organization is that a new Governor is elected each year. The
Governor that is in power at the present time may make a decision in a land case,
or other tribal matters, and the following year when the new Governor takes office
there is nothing to stop the interested parties in having the new Governor pass
on the case and he may reverse the decision of the former Governor,
In this
way
it has caused considerable annoyance and trouble, but there seems to be no way
to overcome it as long as they are to have their own form of Government.
