the cultivated area.
The annual precipitation
averages
about fifteen inches one half of which comes during the
irrigation season.
character of soil, temperature,
crops grown, movement of winds, and many other factors
are of more or less consequence in quantity of water
required for best yields but the excessive snowfall of
last winter with favorable rains this spring and summer
give promise of good crop yields on all cultivated area
one half of which will not require irrigation at all,
Four hundred fifty acres of the present cultivated
area was unfenced and in sage brush last spring, 1918,
and it was stated at that time that clearing, plowing:
barrowing, seeding to crop, and irrigating and harvesting
would cost approximately$ 30 per acre and returns from
small grains and forage at present prices should repay
expenditures in two seasons. The present outlook promises
to do even better than that and the increased val wation
of the raw areas is clear profit to the tribe.
Clearing sage brush, fence construction, and plowing
raw areas continue and at this time fifty acres have been
cleared for the coming fall plowing and thirty acres or
more have been plowed for fall seeding and more is being
plowed.
