1-12NARRATIVE.SECTION 3SCHOOLS.Annual Report1914.San Juan School and Agency.The condition of returned students is not what isshould be; as soon as the young men or young women return tothe reservation the Indians proceed to marry them off tomen and women who have never been to school; when this isdone they are worse off than if they had never attendedschool.An effort is being made to break up this practiceby holding returned students as near the agency as possible,and encouraging them to marry each other.Young marriedcouples are encouraged to take up work along the lines inwhich there were instructed while in school and as muchassistance as possible is given them.Only a small portion of children on this reservation areattending school; the San Juan school, the Toadlena, andthe Mission school at Farmington are full; public schoolsare not within reach.The Indians are very much opposedto sending their children away to distant schools.The State course of study is used wherever possible,and weekly outlines of instruction are regularly preparedand adhered to; the books on the authorized list are welladapted to the needs of the school and no fault has beenfound with them.
