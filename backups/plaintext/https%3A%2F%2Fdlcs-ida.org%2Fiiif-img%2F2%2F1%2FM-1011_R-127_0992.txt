ANNUAL REPORT, SANTA FE NON- RESERVATION BOARDING SCI OOLJUNE 30, 1925Section III- S c h o o l sThe capacity of the school is 450, and that was myaverage daily at tendance for the year My total enrollmentwas 515 Several( nearly thirty) pupils who came at thebeginning of the year were provided for in one of the dayschools a little later on so that after only a few weeksof attendance here they were sent back to their homeshardly think it would be wise to plan on increasing thecapacity of this school at any time in the near futurehe conditions are not such as would recommend anything ofthe kind The water situation in and around Santa Feis such that we are all the time on the ragged edge ofa water famine, and thus we have no water for irrigationand can raise little or nothing for the subsistence ofour pupilsI dare say the employees of this school will averageup right well with those of any other some of course havefailed to reach the high mark which registers excellenceBut one can' t expect all of forty or more employees todo that. I am pleased to be able to say that as a rulemy employees spend a good deal of their spare time readinggood books A study of the reverse side of my May efficiency reports will show what I mean Where anything Dfthat kind is going on, there isn' t a great deal wrongThe school carries all grades fram Beginners upthrough VIII.Thus, the school is, in that regard, an exact parallel of the average rural school, which preparesfor the four- year high school course. I am strongly inclined to the opinion that I should like to keep it thatway indefinitely Perhaps I am old- fashioned, but Idon' t very much like the attempts that are being made inthe outside world at realignment of the elementary andhigh school grades whereby we have a junior high schoolcomposed of Grades VII, VIII, and IX, or something of thesort and a senior high school comprising what is not comprisedin the junior high school. I believe we have it aboutright now when we make Grade VIII a mile- st one- agraduating point- a finishing of the" common branches.Thirty- five of my 36 Grade VIII pupils whostayed in to the last of the school year finished thatgrade this June and were duly graduated. A considerablenumber of them will now transfer to Albuquerque or toHaskell and go on higher. Others will drop out and goto work. I understand that several are entering StVincent' s Hospital here in Santa Fe to take a course oftraining in nursing Some of the other girls will bemarried off willy- nilly before next fall, so thattheir school days are now over.
