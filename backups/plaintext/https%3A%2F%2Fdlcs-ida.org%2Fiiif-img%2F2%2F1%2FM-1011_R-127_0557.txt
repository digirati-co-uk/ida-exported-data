Annual Report19 13Santa Fe Schooland Agency.NARRATIVE.Section 6Field- Irrigation.In view of the impending water famine, which wasimminent at San Ildefonso last year, during April 1912, Isubmitted recommendations looking toward the relief of thepueblo in the purhcase of an engine and pump, which couldbe temporarily installed on the Rio Grande Pueblo dtch,I felt this plan would be feasible and afford temporaryrelief in providing the Indians with water for the comingyear' s crop B. To provide a permanent water supply, I be.lieved a pumping plant should be located in the PojoaqueRiver bed, which would furnish water for the Indian ditchfrom the Pojoaque at such periods when the surface flowfailed.The matter was referred to Superintendent Robinson,and after going over the ground with me, he decided that apumping plant located in the Pojoaque could be completed intime. to be of benefit to the Indians during that season.Sometime elapsed before the preliminary surveys were made todetermine what Indian acreage was under the ditch, and whatadditional land could be cuit vated under the ditch with thewater which could be furnished by the pumping plant. Fromthat time the matter dragged, and up to this date the pumpingplant has not been completed. There was no water for theIndians last summer, and it is very probable that no waterwill be available this summer in time to be of use for theirCrop8. The surface flow of the Pojoaque is taken out by theIrrigation ditches above the Indian river ditch, and exceptduring the melting of the snows in' pring and flood timesthere is very little water available for irrigating purposeBfor the San Ildefonso Indians from this ditchThere should not have been this delay in the installation of this pumping plant, and the project oncestarted should have been completed. This delay has resultedin shortage of crops to the San Ildefonso Indiana, which wouldhave been avoided if the pumping plant had been completed within a reasonablo time. I believe the delay in the completion of
