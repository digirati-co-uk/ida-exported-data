provided with four additional assistants; the Navajo School treeadditional, and the Tohatohi School with four additional. I believethat this number will be sufficient to properly care for pupils anddo the necessary work. The allowance of$ 100. per pupil a year forfood and olothing for these schools is not sufficient and it will benecessary that the allowance be increased to properly olotho and feedthem. The Chin Lee So hool, which is located 85 miles from the railroad should have a year' s supply ahead on hand to properly o onductthe school. The annual estimate supplies are shipped so late in theseason that at times it is impossible to cross the mountain withthe supplies and it becomes necessary for us to hold them at FortDefiance until the roads become passable, and in the mean time thepupils at this school suffer for proper food and clothing. Irecommend, that if at all possible, the Chin Lee School should havea year' s supply in advance on hand.Moral conditions on the reservation as a whole are good.Indians are progressing and are improving their stock, and wouldimprove their home conditions if lumber, windows and doors o oalabe provided foD them.The employees of the various schools have been quite efficientand loyal and very much interested in the welfare of pupils undertheir charge. The schools on the reservation have an elevatinginfluence on the older Indians; they visit their children and seewhat is being a one for them and the way they are cared for and thisgives them an idea that when their children return home during thevacation period that they should/ as we 11 cared for by the parents.be- 8-
