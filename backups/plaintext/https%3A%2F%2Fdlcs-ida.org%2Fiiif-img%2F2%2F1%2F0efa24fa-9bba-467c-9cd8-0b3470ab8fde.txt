Students maintain the on- campus greenhouse
throughout the school year.
Presentations are given to surrounding tribes on many
agricultural issues and sovereignty rights.
The Agriscience class takes a field trip to Valles Caldera. It looks like they found a perfect place to sit.

This produce is a result of students' work in the
greenhouse and the small plot near the plaza.
