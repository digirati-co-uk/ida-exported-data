Pueblo architecture may be said to have a class quite

the whole forming a terraced stronghold without rigid lines,
square corners or hard precision, yet centuries old in con
struction and occupation.

these lines, 16 seems the only architecture of Indian 11re
of the continent that offers adaptation to modern day, and
particularly in the southwest where it developed. The fire
place developed with the architecture as center of family life,
rondering even greater service perhaps in the encouragement
of close family associations and better ventilation than it
asd in control of temperature. There is growing appreciation
of this architecture in the southwest.
