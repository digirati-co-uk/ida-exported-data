Their morals are the same, to all appearances, as one hundred years ago.All the eligible pupils in this particular camp last winter were in School, practically all. The Indians do not alllive at the agency and it would not be well for them to. Theway to get these Indians in School, is to build a Boarding Schooland put them in it.listThe books on the authorized/ are abundant and adaptable toIndian children in any stage,The Industrial Training has been previously described.The School Plant needed is a Boarding School. The Buildingnow used for a Day School Building is sufficient for the needsof a Day School at this place. The Employees have been good,faithful and loyal.The Day School would be much more efficient in Industrial Training i≈ø a Housekeeper were furnishedfor the School. Up to the PXEXEKUxtint present time the FieldMatron has performed this office; and the result has been unsatisfactory.The classroom work in the Day School was during the incumbencyof Mr. Edward E. Horn- now transferred-- very good. Previousto that time the School was onlykept". There was no workdone worthy of the name.The most important thing done for the Indians the past yearis that they have begun to work.
