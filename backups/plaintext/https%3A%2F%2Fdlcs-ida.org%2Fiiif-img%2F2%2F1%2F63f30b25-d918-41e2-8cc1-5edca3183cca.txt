The taot that it is diffioult to suporvise the
young Indian girls who are employed in Albuquerque and
other cities makes me hesitato many times in placing
them out as domestion, I believe it would be a very

students would have their headquarters, or dorni tory
under the barge of& oapable woman who would take charge
of them when off duty.
If this were done, positions
for Indian girls could be obtained in many of the atores
and offices and advantage taken of business training,
possible by attending the local business college, and
preparing themselves as young white girls do.
