Some of theground was high and some was low. In order to get waterupon the high places it became necessaryto lood the lowplaces, and wherever this was done, the result was unfe vorable. It is soaroolynecessaryto say that the firstandmost importantthing to be done in all cases where irrigation18 required, is to thoroughlyprepare the ground by levollingsame so as to avoid either high or low places. I am satisfied that if our ground had been properly prepared the resultswould have been fairly satisfactory.
