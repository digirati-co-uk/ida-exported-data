I examined the books and accounts of the agency which I
think are correct except an error of$ 100.00 which can, and will be
properly explained by the agent. I think all funds received by
the agent have been judiciously expended after proper authority had
been granted, I examined all the open market purchases which were
few, and think those made were a necssity and could not have been
avoided, I think the prices paid were fair and reasonable, no favor
itism was shown, and extra expense was incurred in travel or other
wise in making such purcahses.

The fire bromotobom amounts to but little, it consists of
pails of water in the buildings. I find the question of water
for domestic use is no nearer a solution than at the time of my pre
vious inspection, various methods have been tried during that period,
but none so far as I am able to learn have proved satisfactory.
it is evident that the present system does not at all times furnish
a sufficient supply, some other means of obtaining water must be de
vised before the agency and school will have what they at all times
require. The so called spring from which the present supply is
derived is said to be 34 feet higher than where it is discharged,
much of the pressure is lost it is said because the pipe was not
properly laid, this may, or may not be the case, but I do know that
the pressure, and the volume of water obtained is not what a two inch
pipe with that head should deliver, The top of the ring baths that
are to be placed in the boys dormitory now being erected, are 31 feet
