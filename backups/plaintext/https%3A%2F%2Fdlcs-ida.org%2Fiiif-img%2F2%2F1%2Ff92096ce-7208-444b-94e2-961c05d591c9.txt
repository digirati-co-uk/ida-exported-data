onal Honor Society has been a part of the Santa Fe
Indian School community for over a decade. The basic ideals of
NHS-- character, scholarship, leadership, and service-- infuse the
attitude of its members. To have character, the NHS member
must be unique and make the best decisions for him or herself.
An NHS member displays scholarship in his or her commitment
to learning. An NHS member must also be a leader-- he or she
must have confidence and go forward when others will not. Most
importantly, members should be willing to go out of their way to
help others and show service. All members, who must be in their
junior or senior year of high school, should embody these
ideals and maintain at least a 3. 0 GPA. They must also complete
and document one hour of community service per month. This
year, NHS consists of 29 members and is sponsored by Doreen
Bailey and Jennifer Williams.
