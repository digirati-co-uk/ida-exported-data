Dear
Sir
In reply
to your
favor
of the 13th
instant
I have
to say
that
is you have
a family
I cannot
see how
you can possibly
support
Ours
! on the pay of Black smith
.
There
is no chance
of your
living
to yourself
, but must
sat with
lbo school
ress
, and living
expenses
run uy pretty
high, being
from
18 to 375. par
month
for each
member
and children
under
18 years
of
age ha).! price,
The freight
on goods
and supplies
is very
high
,
ona this
makes
clothing
etc.
very
costly
.
tha temporary
Blacksmith
now here
could
not begin
to make his
exconses
were it not for the fact that he has his own home in town and
raises
his own vegetables
and fruit, and does extra
work when off duty.
I am sorry to have to give you a discouraging
account
of the
chances
in this position
, but it is by no means
a certain
job with
l'ixed salary
as the pay has often buen reduced
below what is named to
you now, and as your place is probationary
there is of course
no
cersainity
about it.
I would
be glad to give you a more encouraging
account
of the outlook
