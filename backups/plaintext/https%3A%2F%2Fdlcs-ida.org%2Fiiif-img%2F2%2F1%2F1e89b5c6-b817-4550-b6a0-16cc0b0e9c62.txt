SANDOVAL- NAVAJOI am a blue turquoise. I live in New Mexico and Arizona. The Indians are very fondof me. They wear me to many different kinds of Indian dances. They use me for manykinds of decoration. They wear strings of me on their necks and chunks of me tied totheir ears. Their silver jewelry contains me. If I am not polished and ready to be usedfor sets, they have to rub me against stones and polish me in fine shape, then I am readyfor sets in bracelets, rings, silver belts, silver buttons, and a lot of other things. Sometimes the Indians sell me to white people. I am very expensive, so not many of the whitepeople buy me from the Indians. I hate to be sold to anybody as I do not like to get awayfrom the person who has kept me for some years._ iniors:Autobiography of a Pinon NutBy JOSEPHINE WRIGHT-- PAIUTE5s, andysteryt weresay toilycameanlife.First!yamongthousilesfromsvmbolou nottonishn onlyI am just a plain pinon nut of Nevada. I am large and my shell is so very soft thatanyone can crack me with his thumbnails. I am very proud of myself for I have beenconsidered the staple food for the Paiute and Washoe Indians for many years. One dayin October an Indian family came and took me out of my home in a fine large cone. Thiswas the first exciting moment in my life. First I was shaken out of the cone with a stickupon a large piece of canvas. There I found myself among thousands of other pinon nuts;then we were put into a large sack and carried away many miles from our home to astrange dwelling of an Indian. One day an old Indian woman dumped part of us intoher flat basket. We are all excited as she pushed us around with her fingers. We had beenat rest for about half an hour when all of a sudden I felt heat on myself and then I lookedabout me and saw hot charcoals. Then the old woman moved us around so fast that Ididn' t mind so much for I knew that we were being prepared for a nice pinon soup for somehungry children who had been watching their grandmother roast us.helpednananananananananananananananananananananananananananananannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn 45LSLSLSLSLSLELELELELELELELSLSLSLSLSLSLSUÇUSLELELELELELELELELELELELELELELSLSLSLSLSLSLSLSLSLSLSLSLSLSLSLSLSLSLSnananananananananananananananananananananananananananananananananananananananananananananananannnnnnnn LCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCULLEUCLLLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCLCULULUCUELELELELELELELELELEUCLEUCLEUEEsed inTass ofAutobiography of a Peach TreeBy CLARENCE EUNIE- ZUNI5 fromsident:be anshop.I am a peach tree that grows in sandy soil. It is sometimes hard to furnish fruit especially when there is an early frost. Another enemy is the wind. A windstorm sometimeskills all of my blossoms. People are very kind to me especially in early Spring when theyclean the dead limbs away. When my fruit is ripe, the villagers gather it and dry it inthe hot sun, then they put the fruit away for their winter use.finerod forAutobiography of a CactusBy IMOGENE TALUMPTEWA – HOPIMy name is Cactus. I grow in Arizona where it is a nice place to live. I grow onland most everywhere. During the summer time I' m always green and fresh, and all different colors of flowers begin to bloom. My flowers are pretty and the children like to lookat them. Sometimes they take all the flowers away from me, although I like to see themlooking at me. I don' t think they ought to take all my flowers. I have very sharp stickersand sometimes I stick the little children, but oh! how sorry I do feel when they startcrying and feel that I should like to talk to them. I don' t know whether I am of any useor not but I like to live in Arizona.POPUPPIPPI PUPUPUCUCURUCUZMCUCUCURUPUPUPUPPIPIPAPIPPPPPPPPPPPלוח- ר- תלחלחכותבותכותכתבותכתבותלחלחלחלחלוחכותבתכחכחכחלחלתFLELELELELE
