$13.37045From all evidence obtainable in the matter I am inclinedto the belief that there was an understanding betweon Chief Tuba, nowdeceased, and the first Mormon sattlors there and that they mutuallyagreed upon a line extending across Mooncopie Wash, above which theMoqui's were to plant and below which the Mormons were to cultivato.This belief is strengthenedby the fact that Chief Tuba subsequentlyjoined the Mormon church, admitted to membershipand Baptized byMormon Missionaries, and there is no testimony tending to show thatcoercion or undue influencewas resorted to in obtaining Tuba's permission far the first party of Mormons to remain and plant there,except that the Indians living who claim to have been present at saidagreoment state very emphatically that only the use of the land wasgiven them by Tuba to be cultivated by them, while they remainedat Moencopie, and that when they were ready to leave the localitythe lands were to be vacated and returned to the Indians.Testimony regardinga division between the mormons andIndians is very conflicting, the Mormons testifyingthat the land waswild and woccipledwhen their people first located at Moencopie; thatthere was a line of division agreed upon and that they have only cultivated and improved lands on their own side of said line. While theIndians assert that the land in dispute was only loaned to the Mormons,and that the only claim the Mormons have to same is from their havingtaken forcible possessionof certain portions of it which they havesince appropriatedand now cultivata.
