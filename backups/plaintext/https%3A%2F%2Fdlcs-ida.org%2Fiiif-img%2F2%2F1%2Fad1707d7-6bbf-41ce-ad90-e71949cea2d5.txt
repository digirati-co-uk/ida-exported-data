Industries- 3-Leupp Indian is due to the fact that the land is owned half byoutside Interests and half by the Indians. This condition is dueto the fact of the land grant made to the old Atlantic and PacificRailroad Company many years ago. This company was given alternateodd numbered sections for a distance of forty miles on either sideof the railroad. A survey has been made of a portion of this territory; sale has been effected by the railroad company to variousprivate interests. A section of land is far too small an amount ofground for any one to make a living on.Sixty acres of land hasbeen designated as the required amount on which one cow will subsist;twelve acres, is estimated for the subsistence of one sheep. Noindividual, therefore, could make a living on a section of land.The Indiens realize this very clearly. A number of them have beenallotted on the public domain and several have been alloted on thereservation proper. They do not, howevern live on the se allotments,since it is impossible for them to make a living on so limited anamount of land. Arrangements should be perfected, if possible, bywhich the odd numbered sections of land lying in the Indian territorycan be purchased, preferably through a reimbursable plan wherebythe Indians would repay through the operation of their oil moneys,without them having to be personally responsible for it. No plan ofwater development can be worked out satisfactorily under presentconditions. On the whole the relations between the Indian andwhite man are fairly agree ble, but there is an insufficient bodyof land to meet the needs of the Indian if he is to expand anddevelop as it is hoped they shall do,
