U. S. INDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL,
Santa Fe, N, M., August 23, 1892.
Supt. wm. B. Creager,
Albuquerque, N. M.
Dear sir:
I desire to know what kind of exercises you have in the
dormitories, after the evening school session is over and before
time for the children to retire.
Do you send an employe in to
have charge?
Do you have Bible reading, prayers, singing, story
telling
or any regularly conducted exercise at that time?
Very truly yours
Superintendent.
