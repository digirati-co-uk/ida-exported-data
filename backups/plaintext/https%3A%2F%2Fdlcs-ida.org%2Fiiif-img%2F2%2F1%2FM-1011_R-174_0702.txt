This Reservation has no teama herd.Conditions on this Reservation are not favorable for carrying on the dairy industry.( a) II have no plans to suggest to further it among the 86Indians as the industry would not be prof itable The dairyherd is kept at the school, and it consists of thirteen wellbred Holsteins.( b) This herd has just been acquired. It is purposedto make it an observation lesson to the Indians to the greatest possible degree in addition to having its use for theBoarding and Day Schools and undernourished children on theReservation.

They do a little of this work, buttheir product is not equal to that of the Navajo.The work of the returned student corapares very favorabi)with other Indians.
