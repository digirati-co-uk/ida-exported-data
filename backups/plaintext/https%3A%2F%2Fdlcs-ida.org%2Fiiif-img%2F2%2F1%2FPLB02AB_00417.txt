MR. JENNIITGS:
12- P3
will you tell us about this other piece o? land the church
claims, it contains a little less than hall an acre, 493,
and that was surveyed out in the name of R. B. Pitaval; it is
bounded by property of Pancracio C. de Baca, and others.
It is right on the southern boundary of the pueblo grant.
Do you lenow that property?
Yes
Q How long have you known it?
All my life.
Give a history of the Ptec possession of that property?
From the time I first knew it, hhat was originally in the
Baca family, private property, they built there, my great
grand father. The priests always held service, there was
another church here and when they built the new church it
was left for the family and the family would pay the priest to
say masses during Noveno from the proceeds of a ranch she
left to support the. t church, which is south of here about a
mile, and they use the products of that ranch today to do
that every year. And after that it was deeded over by one
of the heirs to Mrs. Trinidad c. de Baca.
