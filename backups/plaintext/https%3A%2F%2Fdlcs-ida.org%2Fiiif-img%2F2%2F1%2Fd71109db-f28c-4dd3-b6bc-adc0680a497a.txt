650. These chicks were divided into groups and were cared for by eight
boys who volunteered to do so. Each boy was given a certain percentage
of the chicks to take home

. We have over fifty acres of good farming land on our school farm,
Five to eight acres are used for gardens, sometimes less depending on
the water supply. The crop is planted lato so that vegetables can be
ready for use when the students return to school in the fall. The re
maining land forms a dry land pasture for the hogs and horses depending
on vegetation or any crop that thrives,

a good student. I believe in the care of gavernment property, and see
ing to it that it is not destroyed. I believe in cooperation with my
schocl. I believe in the preparation that is given me for the future.
ALFRED NAYLOR' S HOBBY
You will find a snapshot of Alfred' s hooby in the picture section.
We are giving you his story here.
In the agriculture class, I studied about raising chickens and
pigeons, I started reading some books about raising them which gave me
an interest and made me want to try to put what I was reading into
practice.
Mr. T lachy has a bout one hundred and eleven ba√Ωy chicks which he
gave to me sometime in Morch to take care of.
I started out with one, pigeon which I caught in an old silo. I
later caught a few more and now I have a Plock of twenty.
I built the chicken houses and pens in my vocational class in wood
working.
I also made a house for the pigeons which is large enough to hold
all of them. I painted it cream with a black roof.
In the morning before breakfast, I go down to the barn and feed my
chickens and pigeons, I feed them again after supper and pen them up.
It take me about twenty minutes each time. I enjoy my pigeons and chick
ens because I like to do chores after school, I like them too because
they are easy to handle after you get them startede
: I am going to take my pigeons home. I am getting 15% of 200 phick
ens to take hame.
.. 30.
