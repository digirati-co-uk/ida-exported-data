I have had a short talk with Judge Movie, and he informs me that the case in which the Pueblo 1 Taos 16 interested willin all probability be called. You will remember this case as one broughtby the citizens of Ternado de Taos against the Taos Indians to appropriate the water from the Rio do probao aroakand to gai controlof a certain acequia thro the Indian lands. Mr. Harper and myself madea trip to Taos andtried to adjust this matter satisfactory to all partiesand thought we had; Judge McLaughlin was left to draw the decree, andwhen it was submitted to us, it was so one- sided that we both declaredthat we could not accept same for the Indians.One feature of the de..cree was that it dealt with foreign questions other than water rights.Then again the Taos people would secure all the water in Rio del Puebloand control of the Indian acequia.I trust you can go to Taos, andfight this matter out to the satisfaction of the Indians. I go toJemez on the 12th, and will not be back in time to go to Taos, and sameis not necessary providing you can go/Respectfully,Superintender.t.
