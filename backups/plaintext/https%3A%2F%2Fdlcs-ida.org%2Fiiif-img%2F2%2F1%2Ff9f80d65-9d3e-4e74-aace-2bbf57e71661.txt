We are proud of this cow, and we are proud that we helpedher win.One day in March, 1931, our dairy instructor, Mr. Harris, was reading us the reportfrom the Livestock Supervisor on The Dairy Herd improvement. In this report Old Onetwenty stood fourth place." Why isn' t she first?" asked Bert Pohleala of Janis Ahmie.“' Cause there' s three others ahead of her," answered Janis, jabbing Bert in the ribs witha milk bucket.“ Let' s go after first place for our herd," said Tom Brown." Philip Kowice and I willtake over the feeding and watering."" Jacob and I will tend the barn and stalls, ” said Robert Lomatska.“ Janis and I for the milking, ” said Bert Pohleala. “ Mr. Harris will make out themenu. ”" All through the month we watched the bulletins to see how things were going, ” saidBert to a reporter from the classroom," and every month we could see Old One- twentycoming right up. Now she stands first. Let me tell you something about this cow." Her real name is Wesiu Lilly Skylark Korndyke, H. B. No. 1110633. FreshenedFebruary 15, 1931.
