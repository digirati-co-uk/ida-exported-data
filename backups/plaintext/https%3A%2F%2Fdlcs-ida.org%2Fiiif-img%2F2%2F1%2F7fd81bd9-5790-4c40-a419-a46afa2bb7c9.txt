Mr. Isaac W.Dwire,
Taos, N.x.
Dear Sir:-:
In reply to your letter I m pleased to assure you that all of
the Taos children are entirely woul. I have assured myself that wah is
the case before sending you this word, so you can tell the parents.
Prisciliana was not well for a short time, but i. now all richt. She
did not need medicine, but just a little watching. Her case may have
been the cause of the report reaching the parents.
Te11 them that I will tell them at once if any of their children are
sick,
Very respectfully,
رہا ہے ۔
