The Luki chukischool is now under construction and will require a greatamount of labor, etc., to clear a school farm, there beinga good supply of water for irrigation.The employees at the different schools are es awhole competent and willing workers. Where employees havedemonstrated their ability and gained the confidence of theIndians and pupils I believe they should be rewarded byincreased compensation as every school suffers by changingemployees so often.No pupils have ever graduated from any of the schoolsbut during the coming year a class wi11 graduate from theeighth grade at the Navajo Bo ording school.Morality among the reservation Indians is good.It is estimated that there are approximately1700 children on this reservation without school facilities.With the all school year plen at Tohatchi school, 100 additional pupils at Chin Lee and 50 pupils et Luki chuki thisnumber will not be reduced materially. There are no incorrigble students.Returned students are as a whole doing welland every effort is made to help them build a home and becomea credit to the tribe by being progressive.Academic Work during the past year has been goodwith the result that English speaking among the pupils isgreatly on the increase. I believe the books on the authorlist are good.
