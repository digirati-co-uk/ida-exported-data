1.NARATIVE.Navajo Springs Indian School,Diminished Southern Ute Reservation.The Indians of this reservation have done more work; earnedmore money and spent it to better adventage; raised more andbetter crops; have more and better stock; more good roads; havelived better; dressed better; had better health, a greater birthrate, a smaller death rate; made a greater net increase in population; made less trouble for the superintendent; shown lessopposition to his authority, less regard for the opinions ofthe chiefs and medicine men; there has not been one case ofdrunkenness; they have drawn a smaller amount of rationsinahort, have made nore permanent advancement toward civilizationand self support than they have ever made in any one year-perhaps in five years-. of their recorded history.My predecessor should have his share of the credit for sech conditions.His work made mine possible.An irrigation system, completed the last days of the fiscalyear,will give irrigated land to all who will work it, and theindications are that a large part of this land will soon beoccupied with homes and farmes.Many of the younger men seemanxious to do something for themselver rather than depend uponrations,Three thousand dollars have been spent for Indianlabor in the past year.There was no time when we could notget the laborers if there was money to pay them.Many Indianshave gone off the reservation to get work among the farmers.
