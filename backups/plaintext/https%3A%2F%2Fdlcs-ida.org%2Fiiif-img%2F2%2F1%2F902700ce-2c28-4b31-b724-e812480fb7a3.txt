Finally themoment you all have been waiting for, a proudmember of the class of 2005 is here to say," I' mon the way I' m on the way home, home sweethome." All I have to say is that my heart is like anopen book, for the whole school to read. There' stoo many things to say, and still it can never feellike yesterday. Just sitting in a classroom, listening to that crazy teacher. It would be sad to knowthat I' m going to be leaving that note pad. Enoughof this rhyme I' m running short of time. I spentthree years on the line, sophomore year wascherry lime, junior year was a wild time, andsenior year is study time. I didn' t thinkthis year would come this fast. Now Igot these last words to cash. Out ofall this I like to send my blessings tomy mother, my two brothers, myuncle who has been like a father tome.
