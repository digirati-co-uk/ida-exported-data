A Year in Review by Brittany PedroOur 9th grade year had some fun times. We went on a field trip to Pecos Pueblo,with our New Mexico History teacher Ms. Longeteig — we had a great time there.We had awesome times with Ms. Hartman and Ms. Harkins; they were some of thecoolest and funniest teachers we' ve ever had. Ms. Harkins' s E Block class worked on areally big project for the IAIA( Institute of American Indian Arts); we made models of ourPueblos and what we wanted to see in our Pueblos for the future. It was so much fun!The freshmen class had some problems, but we were able to solve them in theend. This shows how our class has some great potential!Class of 2K11!!!!!40• FRESHMEN
