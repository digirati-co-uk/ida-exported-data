AUG201019ORIGINALRECEIVEDANNUAL REPORT FOR 1919Carson Indian School. 20 1919The Carson Indian School is located about three andone half miles south of Carson City. The Virginia and TruckeeRailroad has a station at the school and there are two trainsa day each way. The post office at the school is called stewart.The school is located on a flat piece of land close to themountains, in a grove of lombardy poplars that were plantedprobably at the time the school was started. Water for domesticsupply and for irrigation is obtained from a mountain stream ina canyon that starts on the mountain not far from Lake Tahoeand runs down to the valley a short distance from the school.The state Prison, the County Poor Farm and one or two ranchesalso obtain their water from this source. In early spring thereis usually emple water for all but the supply for irrigationbegins to run short in the summer months, and sometimes there isnot much more than enough to keep the lawns and gardens growing.The school farm has been improved very much duringthe past year or two, and it is expected that within a shorttime it will not be necessary to purchase hay for the herd ofdairy cows and the horses as has been the custom in the past.This year a fine crop of alfalfa hay has already been cut andit is possible that two more cuttings may be secured. There isalso a promising field of wheat of about 15 acres. The po tatocrop which was frozen down several times in June is on the wholelooking well and a fi ne crop of potatoes is expected. Unless
