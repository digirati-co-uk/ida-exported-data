in most cases there are no springs or other water available
for domestic use, consequently the Indians live in groups
close to springs in the numerous canyons.
Reservoirs have been built for irrigation purposes, some
eminently satisfactory and others complete failures, the
Indians having built many small ones for their individual
uses.
Probably about 1000 acres can be irrigated from these
reservoirs, but much of the land is wild hay land and is
not under cultivation for cereals. The Indians are encouraged
in every way to increase their farming actavities, implements
being furnished them at cost price, in lieu of labor per
formed at periods in the year when no farming can be done,
seed loaned them to return if they harvest a crop,& c.
When agricultural allotments canhd8nbe watered, land in
the vicinity of the Agency that could be watered, and could
not be used by the one additional farmer stationed there,
was given to Indians last spring to cultivate and seed, and
some will harvest small crops of oats thereby that have never
raised any grain formerly.
The bumall agricultural allotments, where they are water
ed by springs, are generallly fenced and the allottee has
built a small log house and bann.
In general it can be said that the Indians are improving
somewhat in farming activities, but, as previously mentioned,
only a very precarious living can be hoped for thereby.
