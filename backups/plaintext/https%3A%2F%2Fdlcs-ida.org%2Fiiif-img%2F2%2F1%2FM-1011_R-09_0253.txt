protection. The allotment of land, the granting of patents
in fee, the capitalizing of annuity funds, the granting to
Indians of more control in the matter of easing, etc.,
are
going forward with accel erati on. Judged by history this will
continue. There will be protection of minors and incompetents,
but more and more responsibility is being and must inevitably
be placed on the Indian himself.
The younger generation should prepare for the day of
self- dependence. They must, if they expect to survive with
credit, get all the education and training possible now. The
Government has made mistakes, and the Indian has not always
been treated with justice, but there can be no doubt that there
is now being offered, without expense to Indian youth, a splen
did educational opportunity, here and in other Indian schools
supported by the federal Government. The time will inevitably
come when this segregated education for the Red Man will be
withdrawn, and Indians placed on the same footing as regards
education as are the children of Ameri–æan citizens. The
Indian parents, the Indian youth, the Indian' s friends should
firmly lay hold of this great fact. The Indian boy and girl
should not only go to school, but that school life should be
oharacterized by an earnestness and zeal for education and
character, such as will forever banish the Indian problem as
far as they are concerned.
