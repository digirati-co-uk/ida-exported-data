Dear Mrs. Devore:
I have one woman from the Navaho reservation at work weaving blan
ets, and teaching a class of Pueblo girls; I want at least one more
expert weaver to do similar work. I want a young woman, unmarried pre
ferred, whom I can place on the rolls as a student, and she will do
the same work. She can make from$ 10. to$ 16. por month. I have
orders
for more blankets than we: can make. I can afford to supply her all she
may need in the way of clothing eto, in payment for what she may teach
the girls. She will get paid for all her work, and at least double what
she could make on the reservation.
I am to send my weavors to St. Louis next Spring, and want
this
woman or girl to go also. Can you help me out.
If you can find a suitable person, I will come after her.
I am very truly,
en
neal
Superintendent,
