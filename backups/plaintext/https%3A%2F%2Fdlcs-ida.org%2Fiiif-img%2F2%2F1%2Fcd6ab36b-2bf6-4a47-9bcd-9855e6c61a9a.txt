So far as is known no pupil has usedintoxicating liquor during the year. It is a pleasantanticipation to think that New Mexico will pass into the listof prohibition states October 1st next. With Nex lexico,colorado, Kansas, Tezas and Arizona ary, the Indians of thesouthwest will be quite well protected from drink. Withthe evils of drink eliminated, the progress of the race,morally, physically and mentally, should be much more rapidand substantial.The pupils of this school are generally quite wellbehaved and quite obedient. During the fiscal year 1917, theschool was without a competent disciplinarianand, of course,the discipline with the large boys was a little lax and theresult was not satisfactory.
