attend whenever it is possible for them to do so.
In many instances there is no celebration of any marriage
ceremony among the Navajoes. This is partictularly true where it
is the second or third marriage for the man or woman.
First marriages are usually arranged by the parents or the
relatives of the boy or girl. The cerezony consists of a gather
ing of the families and relatives for a feast, during which brido
and groom pledge themselves by eating from a bowl or begket of
mush which has been especially prepared for the occasion.
Divorce among the Indians is usually easily accomplished.
Some times it is arranged at a meeting of the families of the
husband and wife, when a settlement of the property is made.
At other times the husband and wife separate by mutual agree
ment.
A great many domestic troubles are brought to this agency
for adjustment, and word has been sent out all over the reser
vation through the medium of the Indian police and Indian Judges
that husbands and wives are not to separate without the sanction
of the superintendent, which may only be obtained on grounds
on which divorce would be granted in the state courts.
