the se diseases,
Though somewhat embarrassed by three changes of Agency
physicians, and the opposition shown by some Indians to accepting
the services of the community nurse, the health work on the Res.
ervation during the current fiscal year has shown very satisfatory
results.. It compares very favorably with that of the last preced
ing years.. Among the principali accomplishments may be mentioned
the stamping out of a threatened epidemic of whooping cough, the
general, good condition of health throughout the year and the ed
ucation of mothers in the proper care of and feeding of babies/.
AB: heretofore stated the most apparent needs is carrying
on the medical or healtith work on the Reservation:
Furni sh suitable work, quarters for the physician and e
tablish a position officia stron for the Zuni jurisdiction.
A field matron or home, teacher should also be provided for
these people.
For the past year no fi eld meteen work has been done. The
position was abolished a year ago. When the position was authoriz
ed, the field matron went from Ä§ome to home visiting the Indian
Women, ad vi sing and assisting in the betterment of conditions about
the home;; the making of suitable clothing for the children the prep
arati an of proper dietes and giving instruction in general sanitary
rules. Though thi swork has been taken up to some extent by the com
munity nurse, the nurse has more than she can do to look after the
health question, therefore it has of necessity been overlooked to
a considerable extent.
