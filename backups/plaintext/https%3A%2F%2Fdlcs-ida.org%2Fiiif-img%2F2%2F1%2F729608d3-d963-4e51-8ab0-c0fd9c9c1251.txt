A DAY IN THE LIFE OFMARK CHERESPOSY JR.The adolescence stage of a person is such that this is the stage in lifewhen incindencies( including the unexpected) occur. The question ofmaturity versus immaturity is at stake. But above all this, being mature ornot is not the least bit important when tragedy strikes as did the eve ofJuly II, 1984. It was on this date that left the family of Mark CheresposyJr. in shock upon receiving the news that Mark Jr. was hit by anautomobile. The point here is not only did Mark touched the lives ofmany because he was and is part of the Santa Fe Indian Schoolcommunity but because there is a certain underlying message which Markhas for all students whose curiosity takes them beyond their limits ofcontrol. A benefit was held in his honor at Santa Fe Indian School to helpdefray expenses while he was hospitalized.Mark has made a tremendous recover throughout this ordeal and one canonly praise him for what he has done for himself. He doesn' t want to betreated any differently from the other students. He has had time toreevaluate his lifestyle and wants" to make it better". He feels people canhave fun without messing their inner self up and" when you do something( like party) don' t go off by yourself cause something might happen".101
