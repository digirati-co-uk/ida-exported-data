Chapter or clan organizations are century old among the Pueblos and,
while they give little publicity to the purpose, membership, etc.,

The ir industries, of whatever line, have organized direction and,
collectively or individually, there is definite procedure so definite
indeed that to all productive effort within the pueblo there attaches
