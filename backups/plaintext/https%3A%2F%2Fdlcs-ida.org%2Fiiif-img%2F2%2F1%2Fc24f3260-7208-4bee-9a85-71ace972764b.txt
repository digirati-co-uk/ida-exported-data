00: 1VASt. Peter Square in Rome, Italy.Rome. He XIXIXIXXXT:Experienceof aLifetimeKen.My trip to Europe was a great experience. We left Thursday, April 16, 1992 from the airport in Albuquerque. Wewere on the plane for about three hours, then landed in St.Louis, Missouri. The total hours it took to London wasabout 14 hours. It was a restless ride on the plane, it wasmy first time flying. The ride was like being in a car downthe highway, except we were off the ground 35, 000 feet inthe air.When we arrived in London, I thought it was going to be ashock, but it was like America, except people drove on theleft side. We got to see the changing guards. I thought thatwas pretty neat. Paris was also like America, but it had a lotmore sights to see. The place I really enjoyed was Rome,Italy. Rome had a lot of history to offer. It was like beingthere when history was happening. They had a lot of big,beautiful churches and Roman ruins.The whole trip to Europe was an experience of a lifetime,and I am happy that I got to go!— Chaslyn Pacheco“ The Mona Lisa"1And106
