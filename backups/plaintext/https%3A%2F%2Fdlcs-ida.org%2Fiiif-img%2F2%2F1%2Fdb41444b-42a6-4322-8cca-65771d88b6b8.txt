To Kis Excellency
,
Juan Baptisto Talache,
Chamita, New Mexico,
Some l'ifteen days ago, during my absence from Santa Fe, Assistant
Superintendent George B. Haggett allowed Nerio Tapia, a pupil of this
school to visit his home at San Juan; he did this upon the represen
tation made to him that the services of the boy were needed in gather
ing the corn crop.
Nerio was expeoted to return in ten days
and he has not done so.
He is enrolled in this school for the year
and I desire that you require him to return at once.
He has some
money on deposit with me and should he fail to return within a reason.
able time I shall confiscate his money, treat him as a runaway and use
his own funds to bring him back with.
I am, very truly,
el
Superintendent.
