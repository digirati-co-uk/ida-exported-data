receiving our most careful attention. The outlook forthe future of stock raising among the Indians is goodalthough it is necessary that the Indians depend lessupon livestock raising as a means of livelihood, andturn to farming and gardening. The Indians utilize allof their range lands. Conditions on this reservation arenot favorable for the dairy industry. The Indians derivea considerable revenue from the sale of Navajo rugs. Duringthe year the price of wool has been such that much of theWool which otherwise would have been sold has been put intorugs and it is feared that this condition will congestthe rug market to a certain extent but it is not believedthat this condition will exist over a very long period oftime.The time of the stockmen who are employed on thisreservation is spent in encouraging the Indians with theirlivestock, supervising the dipping of the sheep and so forth.Their services in this manner are very valuable to theIndians. There are no agency farm positions under thisjurisdiction and this is a matter which should receive veryserious consideration. Two farmer positions should beestablished as he retofore stated in order that the Indiansmay be encouraged to farm such land as is available and thusproduce for themselves a large portion of their living.The Indians require encouragement rather than instructionin farming although with the plan which we now have in mind,which is to introduce new ve getables, there is no doubt butthat some instruction with regard to the care. and plantingof such ve ge tables will be required.So far as I have knowledge the dealings of thelicensed traders has been fair in all respects. Our tradersare very helpful to the Indians and to this office throughtheir co- operation and desire to render any assistancepossible. Up to the present time no fairs have been heldon this reservation. It is believed that such a celebrationshould be instituted and this matter will receive seriousconsideration, and if it is at all feasible an exhibit willbe arranged at the County and State fairs.A considerable amount of employment has been providedfor the Indians locally during the year and it is quiteprobable that there will be even more employment during thecoming year. This employment has been with teams and scrapersin the construction of dikes, roads and so forth and it issuch employment that the Indians prefer. The Indians requireassistance in finding outside employment and it is stronglyrecommended that an employment agent be stationed for workin the Northern part of Arizona so that assistance can begiven the Indians of the reserv tion lying within thatpart of the State.- 3-
