A new office building is in course of construction which,when completed will fill a great need.An appropriation for a kitchen and dining room has beenmade, and it is expected that the new building will be completedsome time in the fall. This need is very urgent.A central heating plant is now perhaps the most urgent needof the school. An assembly hall and an addition to the schoolhouse are also greatly needed.The repair fund has been used in keeping up repairs to thepresent buildings, remodeling the old main building for employees'quarters, and for the erection of a new office building.The prejudice on the part of white communities against receiving Indian pupils in school is very pronounced. The statesuperintendent of Instruction, with his assistants, however, areco- operating in every way to bring about a different attitude inthis respect, and in some places andian children are attendingpublic schools..Superintendent.TaloructuuduCars on Indian School,Stewart, Nevada.June 30, 1922.- 2-2
