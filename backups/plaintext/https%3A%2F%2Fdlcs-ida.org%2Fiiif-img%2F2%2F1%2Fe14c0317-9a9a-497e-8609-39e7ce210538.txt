Of the 330, 000goats, ninety percent are nondescript product in truth.The crosses and Inbreeding have sacrificed pelt, milk, andmohair with nothing gained in the sacrifice save perhapshardiness. The goat herds in the main contribute onlytheir flesh and pelt at slaughter, probably forty poundsof meat and a pelt worth maybe a dollar. Better breedingpractice with the Angoras or some good milk strain cauldpromise better return from fower goats, and less range consumption. For example, Angoras promise two to five poundsof mohair each year, selling for forty to fifty cents a poundand at slaughter would offer quite as much flesh for subsistence and a pelt varying in value with the season of slaughter,but in average likely less than the pelt of the common goat.The Toggenburg. Saanen or Nubian milk- strain could promise milkand milk product in the home, the value of which in subsistencecould measure well for the range consumed and at slaughteryielding flesh and pelt quite approaching in value that hadfrom their nondescript herds, whatever the breeding, the goatherds could be reduced to advantage since the improved sheepgive so much better return on the range consumed.of the six hundred thousand to seven hundred thousandsheep maybe as many as one hundred thousand are wethorepromising only annual wool return and flesh for rubeistence at slaughter. The wothers feeding always in front,crop the best range, get the first water, keep in bestcondition, grow the best fleece, and show little range loss.Unfortunately the eves promising lambs as well as fleeceand flesh, are crowded to the rear, get less feed and water,lose in fleeco and flesh, which in turn result in lightlamb crop and heavy range loss.Herding on the somi- desort range cannot be close, forwhen the flock is hold in close compas the goats and wethersget the best forage while the awes and lambs get only theleft over, consequently having to feed longer or go to thecorrals or bedding ground empty and hungry.
