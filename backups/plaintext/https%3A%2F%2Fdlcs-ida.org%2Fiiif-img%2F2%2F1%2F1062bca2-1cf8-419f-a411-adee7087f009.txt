Sir
:
I have
the
honor
to
intorm
you
that
the
Lard
estimated
for
on my
last
annual
estimate
( for
the
fiscal
year
1893
) has
not
yet
been
received
.
The
school
has
no lard
now
and
is
very
much
in
need
of
it.
I should
like
to
have
it
shipped
as
soon
as
pos
ible
.
Very
respectfully
,
Jill
Su perintendent
