The farm which is four milos distant from the school
will
prove to be a paying proposition when properly managed, particularly
during the years of the greatost rainfall and at this time there
sooms to be good indications that we will be able to harvest
$ 1,500.00 worth of hay, grain and vegetables.
already
As 18/ know
to your office, the Navahos under this jurisdiction
nover will be able to farm on « vory large scale and only in the
more favorable valleys where land can be irrigated from flood wator.
Improvoment of stook continues to be a subject of importance and last
year at the stato fair we exhibited 16 improved sheop and secured 15
ribbons, most of which were first prize.
This fall wo expect to
hold the first Navajo Fair at Crown Point, which will be September
19-20-21.
These dates are earlier than I would like to hold the
fatr, but these dates seem best on account of being Just prior to the
State Fair which gives us a better opportunity to secure products for
the State Fair exhibit. Last year the Indians received from 15 to
20 ¢ per pound for their wool but this year they have received better
prices; from 20 to 254 per pound.
Water development continues to be the basis for future oper
ations and I am able to report that under the well drilling contract
of Charles E. Via, we secured a nice flow of artesian wa tor.
This
well is on the reservation and was drilled to a depth of 700 ft.,
the first water vein being struck at some thing over 500 ft and a
stronger flow at nearly 700 ft. This well will furnish plenty of
water for stock purposes.
The Indians are being induced to make
resevoirs near the well for storage purposes.
