- 5-Section 1- Law and Order- Conoluded.Indians raise grape s, make and drink a native wine and frequently purchase liquor from disreputable" bootleggers". There isconsiderable drinking in these two pueblos but the other pueblosare comparatively sober and law- abiding. Officials employed forthe suppression of the liquor traffio have been informed of the seconditions and have visited the pueblos but their work during tlelast two years has not been attended with results. The ChiefSpecial Officer has suggested to me that he believes better results will be secured after New Mexico is admitted as a state.As here tofore suggested in this report, it is believed if theSuperintendent could use some of the money appropriated for thesuppression of the liquor traffic and have his own man stationedat Isle ta and authorized to act as deputy sheriff, better results would be secured.The Pueblos gamble but little, if any. The Ca on citoNavajos gamble in a small way and but little of their time isconsumed in the past ime. It would be difficult to stop the gambling among the Navajos without having a white employe stationedconswith them.
