Mr. J. M. Berger,
Tucson, Ariz.
Dear Mr. Berger:
I left home on a tour in the pueblos on the morning of the 9th.
On the same evening, Nov. 9th, Domingo Pedro, a Papago ran away, and
has not been heard from. He had been in the hospital for some time on
account of sore eyes etc. but was apparently cured.
He
is a large
strony
hoy, not brilliant, but rather a good boy. Had he come to me and asked,
I should possibly have sent him home, as I was considering doing so.
Let me know if he reaches the reservation and in what condition .he is;
I hardly think I
shall send for hin. You may tell him 80. The boy had
$ 16. on deposit with me, and
what little there may be left after pay
ing the expenses of hunting him, if any, will be sent to him, providing
he reports to you or you can find him, otherwise it will be turned into
lae
athletic I und.
I am very truly,
leggerintendentes
Superintendent.
