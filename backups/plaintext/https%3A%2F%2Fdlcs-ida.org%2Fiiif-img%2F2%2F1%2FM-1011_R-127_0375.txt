Annual Report, 1926.San Juan Agency.employees now, as a rule, are suitably and comfortably housed.The Camp School Unit of the San Juan School, sometimes calledthe es School, the construction of which doubled the capacityof the San Juan School, was completed and turned over by thebuildees in late June i925. To prepare this plant for occupancyrequired a great deal of work and, as the establishment of thisunit had not increased the nechanical force of the San JuanSchool, this work foll upon a crew whose numbers had alreadybeen reduced to a minimum, considering the work of the oldplant alone, a crew that already had a full burden. Thisadditional work necessarily meant that much repair work atthe old plant must be temporarily neglected while the newtask was being accomplished. All available employees were putat this task and most of the summer and fall were thus consumed.A person who has no actual experience in opening a school plantturned over as this plant was can have 1ittle conception ofthe volume of work involved. There were floors to clean windowsto wash, screens to make and put in place shades to assembleand place, stoves to set up, chairs to assemble likewise stools,wardrobes to make, shelving to make and place, school desksto assemble and place, flour bins to make, coal bins to make,and literally scores of other things that must be fabricatedand placed or installed before the children and employeescould occupy. The old plant is in such condition that anylittle neglect thereof, even for a short time, is very apparent. However, the new work has nearly all been assimilatedand much of the repair work on the old plant is no in processof completion and it is believed the mechanical force as itexists, will succeed in mastering the situation. However,they are by no means" out of the woods" at the present writing.The clerical force is short handed and has been for thepast three years. Auditor Walker noted this and in his latestreport covering conditions at this place, while complimentingthis force upon the volume and quality of the work turned out,said he knew of no other place in the Service where additiona.clerical help is so badly needed. he recent resignation ofJaspercW. Elliott, chief clerk, makes this condition doublyacute. For Mir. Elliott was& men of many years' experience,rapid, and accurate,not averse to working Sundays and overtime. During his stay at Shiprock he di ractically thework of two clerks and unless a successor of equal experienceand ability, and of like disposition can be found additionalclerical help will be a necessity.There is also a lack of field employees.
