So0April 26,Somebody suggested that we finish up our bird bath.Marcelino and Ben went after a little cement to mix with thesand so it would hold water. The boys were just going topatch it up most anyway. I told them that if anything wasworth doing at all, it was worth doing well.So we had adiscussion as to the kind of workers we should be. Whenthey finally finished, it looked fairly well.Some of the boys had not finished the lapboards, sothey worked on them.The rest of the children cleaned the yard. Theyalways seem to think that if they pick up sticks, trashor anything around the Hogan, and throw it just a littlefarther away from the Hogan it is all right. We have totalk each time about the things we can pile up and burn,and the things we have to bury. Then some have to bewatched to see that it is done right. They are so accustomed just to throwing things around anywhere. Dirt doesnot disturb them much.We found some more flies in our Hogan." How can weget rid of these flies?"Roy-" Everybody kill flies."" They give us germs, disease, and fever."We discussed what to do with dead animals, garbage,and other refuse. Where the sheep pen should be located,and the building of out- of- door toilets was also discussed.Also how to use screens, and how to keep things free fromflies here and at home. we made posters showing how todestroy flies, and how to prevent them from breeding.my
