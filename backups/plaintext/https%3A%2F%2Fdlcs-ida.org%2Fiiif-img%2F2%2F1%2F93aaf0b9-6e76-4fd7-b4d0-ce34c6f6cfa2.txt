April 26,
Somebody suggested that we finish up our bird bath.
Marcelino and Ben went after a little cement to mix with the
sand so it would hold water. The boys were just going to
patch it up most anyway. I told them that if anything was
worth doing at all, it was worth doing well.
So we had a
discussion as to the kind of workers we should be. When
they finally finished, it looked fairly well.
Some of the boys had not finished the lapboards, so
they worked on them.
The rest of the children cleaned the yard. They
always seem to think that if they pick up sticks, trash
or anything around the Hogan, and throw it just a little
farther away from the Hogan it is all right. We have to
talk each time about the things we can pile up and burn,
and the things we have to bury. Then some have to be
watched to see that it is done right. They are so accus
tomed just to throwing things around anywhere. Dirt does
not disturb them much.
We found some more flies in our Hogan.
" How can we
get rid of these flies?"
Roy-" Everybody kill flies."
" They give us germs, disease, and fever."
We discussed what to do with dead animals, garbage,
and other refuse
. Where the sheep pen should be located,
and the building of out- of- door toilets was also discussed.
Also how to use screens, and how to keep things free from
flies here and at home. we made posters showing how to
destroy flies, and how to prevent them from breeding.my
