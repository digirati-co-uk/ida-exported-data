1Circular No. 1604.July 1, 1926.Η Ο Ρ Ι Ι Ν DI Α ΝAGENCYANNUAL REPORTNARRATIVE SECTION.Section V-Allotments.We have no allotted lands on the Hopi reservation. Ibelieve some was allotted at one time but that the Indians refused to accept the selections made or attempt to improve them.No attempt to allot them land has been made since. I believeit is best to let them select their own lands where theirinterests lead them, giving them these lands permanently laterwhen the reservation is opened.There are no allotments on the public domain under thejurisdiction of this agency.Respectfully submitted,CampofThia,Edgay K. Miller,Couperintendent.EKM/ RE
