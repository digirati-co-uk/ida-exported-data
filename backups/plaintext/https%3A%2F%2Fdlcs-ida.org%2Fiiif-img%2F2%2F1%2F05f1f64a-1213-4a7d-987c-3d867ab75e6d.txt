-- Health.
1-2 The southern, or Albuquerque district, has had
an exceptionally good year. The physicians have done
their work so effectively that, though epidemics of
small pox and diphtheria have been prevalent amongst
the Mexicans in their vicinity no Indians contracted the
diseases.
In the Santa Fe distriot where the work of the
physicians has not been so effective there was an epidemio
of measles and diphtheria which in the Pueblo of Santo
Domingo caused the deaths of about one hundred children.
3.
The sanitary conditions around the homes in
Santo Domingo are the worst imaginable, but since the
Office desired that no force be used in remedying the se
conditions it will take some years of education to
better them.
За
The field matrons at Santa Ana, Isleta, Cochiti,
and San Juan have done much good work in this line.
The
physicians have made inspections and offered suggestions,
but since we can only suggest our work is not very effective.
Force where necessary should be employed to compel compliance
