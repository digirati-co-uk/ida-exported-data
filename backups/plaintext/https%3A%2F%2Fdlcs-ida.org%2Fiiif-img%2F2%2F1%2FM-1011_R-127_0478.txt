Annual ReportLaw& Order- 6Santa FeSchoalThe majority of the Pueblos are nominally Catholicsbut de spite outward manifestations of conformity to any creedof the Christ ian religion, the Indians are at heart and intruth pagan. The essential contributing factor to the per.petuation of their condition of heathenism is the constantlyrecurring religious ceremonies and dances. These dances andreligious ceremonies are more potent in the ir effect in shaping the lives of the Indians than can be apparent to the casual observer who witnesses the celebration of their fiestas witha natural interest in the pic ture thus presented of old Indianites and custons. In this perpetuation of the ceremonialrites of paganism, manifest in their dances, is centered theWAole strength of the reactionary element as exercised in thepaternal form of government common to all the pueblos. Throughthese religious ceremonies and dances, under the direction ofthe high priest, or casique, the beliefs and the rites ofpaganism are perpetuated and impressed upon the younger generation. Returned students and the younger people generallywho have learned outside ways and customs, on taking up theirand work among their own people in the pueblos,are co.erced, by the preponderance of public opinion in the Indiancommunity, into laying aside those things they have learnedwhich make for progress and which they would of their own freewill continue, and are made to conform to the old reactionarycustoms of the pueblo. Severe punishment, such as floggingand confinement, has followed their refusal to readily yieldto the dictates of those in authority in the pueblos,This conformity to the customs and religion of the pueblopertains to matters of dress and living as well as to dancesand ceremonies, Close observation and study of the effects,as evidenced in present conditions in the pueblos, upon theIndians generally, and particularly upon the younger generationwhere in lies the hope and promise of the working out of theproblems of their people- have convinced me that real progressand betterment of conditions in pueblo life can only be substant ially realized through the abolition of the pagan dancesindulged in in all the pueblos, together with the curbing ofpueblo authority over the young people as regards the right ofthe individual to freedom of thought and action and conduct ofhis own affairs, particularly with reference to his beliefs inreligious and publio, as well as private mattersWAREHEARTHUNDERWRITERTAIN INHERENCH
