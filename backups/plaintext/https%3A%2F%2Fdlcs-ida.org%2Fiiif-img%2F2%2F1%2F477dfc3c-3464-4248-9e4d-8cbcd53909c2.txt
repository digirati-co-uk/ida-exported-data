Dear Mr. McC.
I ag just home from the Albuquerque Fair, and must return tonight,
but desire to say that I shall conttnue to make blankets, and you can
la ve the out- put, which of course will not be large. I hope to get
some more weavers at work soon. I have two
fine blankets off the loom,
which to you will
be$ 10. and$ 12. eache
All I dosire to ask, and
shall insist on, and that is that each blanket sold to you shall boar
a card
stating the weaver's name, and the school, Santa Fe, where made.
I am very truly,
Jannten
Superintendent.
