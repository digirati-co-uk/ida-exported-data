oA letter dated March 27, 1922, to CHARLES V. SAFFORDfron GEORGE T. BREWINGTON, states that he was at this moetingand from the standpoint of the deyelopment of the Reservationlands for oil and gas the situation is altogether unfavorable.In his opinion kr. ESTEP 16 opposed to granting oil and gaspermite. He remarks that 11 ESTEP reflects the opinion of theDepartment, nothing can be done, because the agent in charge,while it does not appear on the surface, does in fact controlthe action of the Indians. A meeting was called on not overfive daye' notice, and as for the party BREWINGTON represented,This lackto wit, CRITS, he had no notice to appear at all.On theof proper notice was a subject of unfavorable comraent.calling of a meeting the fact of there being so Iew outsideIndians prompted the suggestion that the meeting be postponed.If the leases had been granted to those who wished them, he saysseveral thousand dollars cash rentals would have been forthcoming.BREWINGTON thinks that ESTEP, having been with the Department for a long time, seems to be out of accord with a progressive policy for the development of the Reservation. Infact, the giet o: IR. BREWINGTON'S letter seems to be that ESTEPis distinctly conservative and at the bottom he is not reallydesirous of developing the minoral resources but is rather infavor of maintaining things in the status quo.
