dians have refused the past year to purchase the necessary
rams for improving the quality of their flocks. They are now
in need of rams and it is hoped that a number can be supplied
the coming year.
( b) This has been a mild winter and very few losses have been
sustained.
( c) This was answered in a previous paragraph.
( a). The outlook for the future, if water development can be
made, is most encouraging.
( e). No stock belonging to white men, except a few trespass
animals, is upon the reservation and none is wanted here.
( 1) All range land is utilized. However, because of the lack
of water some ranges afford much less feed than could be re
ceived from them while lands along the water courses are over
grazed.
( g) This was answered in a previous paragraph.
( h) There is no tribal herd here.
13. The Zuni Indians live in villages and cannot keep dairy cat
tle under such conditions.
( a) Unless their mode of living is changed there is no manner
by which, except in a few cases, dairy cattle can be cared for.
( b) A registered Holstein dairy herd is kept at the Sanatorium
ranging in age from three to eight years old.
( c) Eight gallons of milk is sent to the Day School, each day
where a certain amount is issued to the babies of the village.
A few have appreciated the value of this milk to such an extent
that they have secured cows of their own.
( a) We are raising as many heifer calves as we can, not only
to increase our herd, but for sale to the Indians. As stated
above, a few are in position to handle such but until they move
from their pueblos they cannot care for dairy cattle.
