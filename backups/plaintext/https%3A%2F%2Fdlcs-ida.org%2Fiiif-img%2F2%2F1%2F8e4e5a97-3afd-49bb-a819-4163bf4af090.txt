MethodsРя вet OF INDIAN*RECEIVED.AUG2- 1910Circular# 435Annual Report.EDUCATION DIVISION- PURCHASES.The supplies received last year have been generally satisfactory, with the exception of the syrup and flour. As reportedto you before, the pupils do not 11ke the syrup furnished, and theflour delivered last year was a pastry flour and not a bread flourand not at all adaptable for our use here. I have recommendedthat the office send us flour this year made from hard, springwheat, whioh makes good bread.A11 goods and supplies were delivered in good season with theexception of the fruit, beans and feed, which were not receivedbefore the third quarter 1910. If these particular supplies couldbe delivered sooner, it would be a great convenience to the school.Both boys and girls' uniforms are manufactured at the schooland are satisfactory.
