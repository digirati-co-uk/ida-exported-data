An epidemie of sore throat and mouth
effected
a number
of our pupils last year, though no fatalities
occurred from this
eped√©mic.
Your Office should not permit further delay in the
construction
of a hospital to care for pupils of the school as well
as the reservation
Indians who wish medical attention, but should
be constructed
and not be postponed
from year to year.
