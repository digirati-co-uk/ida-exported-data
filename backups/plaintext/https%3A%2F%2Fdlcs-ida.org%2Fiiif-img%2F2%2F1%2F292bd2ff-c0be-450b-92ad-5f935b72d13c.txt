( 24)teachers of long experience, persons I would rank with the best ofIndian teachers, for the most part the transferred people aredisgatisfied from the date of beginning.I cannot severely criticisethem in this, because of quarters conditions. Even at one of thebest schools, the quarters are crowded. An inspector would probablypass upon the Santo Domingo day school as an excellent property.It has a quite large school building, and at the time of constructionone house was built for employees. Today this school requires ahead teacher, two assisting teachers, a housekeeper, and a laborer.All these persons have to be quartered in one building, having onelarge and four small rooms.A8 sone of the employees are Indians,the situation does not make for contentment.The Pueblo Indians of New Mexico have been receiving educationfrom the United States Government since the date of opening the oldCarlisle Indian school.There are now the large Albuquerque andSanta Fe boarding schools, and thirteen day schools under theSouthern Pueblos Agency, which, with the mission schools, accommodate1658 pupils. We have 428 pupils attending the Catholic schools ofJemez, Bernalillo and Santa Fe,A relatively small number of pupilsgo to public schools and schools for defectives.All told, theSouthern Pueblos shows 1940 children of school age, and 1658 of theseenrolled in schools.There remain about 300 children to be providedfor, being for the most part at Acoma, Santo Domingo and Santa Ana.
