OF THE INTERIOR,
UNITED STATES INDIAN INSPECTION SERVICE,
Mescalero. New Mexico, April 25th.1900.
The Honorable.
The Secretary of the Interior.
Sir:
According to instructions contained in your communication
of January 26th, 1900, I have the honor to report the result of my
inspection of the Mescalero reservation, New Mexico.
I found this reservation in charge of Walter McM. Luttrell,
M.D. superintendent of the Mescalero Indian Boarding School who was
acting agent, as well as superintendent of the boarding school.
The Indians of this reservation have progressed in civil.
ization since my last inspection; at that time they were living in
camps as savages, they were only seen issue days; after receiving
what the Government gave them, they returned to their mountain
homes, and were seldom seen until more rations, or annuities were
issued; at the present time they are living in small comfortable
houses, and are cultivating every available piece of land that can
be irrigated, and are producing crops enough to make them self sup
porting; they have adopted the white mans methods, and seem to be as
far advanced in civilization as the average Mexican, and some of
their white neighbors, quite a number of them have fair sized herds
of sheep which are increasing each year.
No Government farm is maintained at this reservation, none
is required. I saw no Indian here competent to fill any position
now occupied by a white employe.
Below please find a list of the people employed at this
reservation.
Action Agent.
Walter McM.Luttrell; Tennessee; age 31; male; acting agent,
and superintendent of the Mescalero Boarding School taking all his
