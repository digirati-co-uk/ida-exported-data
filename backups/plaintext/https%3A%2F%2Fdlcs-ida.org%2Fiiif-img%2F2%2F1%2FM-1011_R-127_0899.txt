A few years ago, our annual graduating classes numberedfive or six perhapsThe number has been steadilyclimbing until, as already stated in this report, thisJune fourteen finished the Eighth Gradeour highest yearof work here. I look for the number next year to bearound twenty- five. We so often hear criticisms of ourschool system on the score that the pupils go back to theblanket anyway. They don' t as a rule go back to theblanket if they have stayed in school long enough toreach some definite point Of course those who stayJust long enough to get a little smattering of Englishand less of arithmetic, etc., can' t do anything BUTgo back to the blanket. So it all dependsupon how longa pupil remains in schoolTalke my word for it that ofall the pupils who finish Grade VIII, very few will evergo back to the blanket. It may be well for me here tosay that when I use the expression" go back to theblanket", I am not referring to what a pupil wears afterhe leaves school nor anything as to the manner of hishair- cuts It is his' internal and not external qualifications" to which I have referenceThe sentiment of the people in and around Santa Feis very friendly toward the Indian friendlier by andlarge than to the white man.. Of course, it all dependsto a great extent, upon the individual IndianOur expendituresthis year were about the same asthe year preceding.
