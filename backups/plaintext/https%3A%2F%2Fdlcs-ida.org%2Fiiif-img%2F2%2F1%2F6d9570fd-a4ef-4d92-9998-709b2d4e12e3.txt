I have the honor to request that the drawings showing changes to
be made in the old school rooms of the main building, and which were
forwarded to your Office on October 19,1898, be returned,
Office letter of December 6, 1898, states that the amount asked for,
ore
for this work is not available this year, and I am anxious to have
the orawings so that I can make the proper estimate as soon as the
appropriation for 1900 is available.
Very respectfully,
Your obedient servanto
