2.After ascertaining the sentiment of the citizens of Flagstaff andits vicinity, regarding said extension of the Navajo reservation, Iproceeded to Tuba City, a distance of 100 miles by the road I traveled,and was two days making the trip by team, which route was by way ofTanner Crossing of the little colorado, Willow Springs and Moen Ava.I was 22 days at Tuba City and vicinity, during which time I traveledover considerable of the country lying southwest and west of the moquireservation; also made a trip from Tuba city to Oraibi Mesa, by way ofthe Togas jay Wash, Blue Canyon, and Denebato vash, a distance of 60miles, about one- third of which route was outside the reservation,which with my return trip of 90 miles from Tuba city to Flagstaff, bya different route from that I traveled when going to Tuba city, I wasthus enabled to see considerable of the reservation and character of thecountry bordering upon it, which being chiefly a light sandy soil, subJect to drifting with every high wind that blows, did not impress mefavorably, and 20 days, out of the 22 that I was at Tuba City and vicinity being almost one continuous sand storm, my earlier impression of thecountry was not changed..The present season has been unusuallydry, there having been no rains of any consequence in the Little Colorado country for several months past, the result of which is that water is very scarce and grazing exceedingly poor throughout the entiretract of country that I traveled over.Grass is at all times veryscarce in this sandy desert, and the long drought has dried up the rootsto such an extent that a green blade is rarely seen, and were it notfor the grease- wood, sage- brush, and other shrubs that cattle and sheepcan subsist upon, there would be great loss of stock from the barrennessof the ranges, caused by the protracted drought.There is no question but that the present reservation of the Navajoand Moqui Indians is insufficient for the Navajo herds( the Moquireservation, all except what is cultivated by the Moquis, being appropriated by the Navajos for grazing their flocks) in consequence of whicha large number of the Navajos are frequently off their reservati on onthe public domain, ranging their herds as far south as the Santa Fe
