and goats perished from exposeure, this with the low price of wool
during the past few years has almost made paupers of those who a
few years ago were wealthy, they are so poor, that many families have
been obliged
to kill and eat a large number of their sheep, goats,
and horses
or starve
, The Navajo's now own a large number of
sheep, goats, and ponies, but the sheep are of poor quality, they have
been inbred for a long time, the fleese produced is light, the wool is
coarse and of poor quality, it sells for the lowest price of any in
the market
. These sheep are great rangers, they travel from 10 to
20 miles a day while feeding
, the result
is, those that are poor and
weak soon die.
These Indians
have of late learned
a great
many things from the white sheep owners
in this section, they have
found that if they cross their sheep with Merino bucks, the cross
produces
a sheep much superior
to theirs, one that does not range so
far which gives the poor weak ones a chance to improve, and the loss
jis not nearly so great, such a sheep produces
more pounds of wool,
the wool is of better quality
, and sells. for more money.
Several
Indians have requested
me to ask the Government
to pur
chase for their use Merino bucks to improve their flocks, they say
they are to poor to purchase bucks for themselves
,
I would recommend
that 400, or 500 Merino bucks be purchased
and
sent to this reservation
, that the agent be instructed
to distribute
them among the worthy Indians to improve their stock.
There
are a few Indians who a few years ago sold their sheep
and invested
their money in cattle, no individual
owns a large num
ber, but those owning cattle are in better financial condition
than
the average sheep owner.
I saw no Indian at this agency who was competent
to fill any
position
now occupied
by a white employe
.
All the supplies
, ma
terials, agricultural
implements
, and tools were in good condition
, and
are receiving proper care and attention.
No supplies except beef
are sold to agency or school employees
.
The agency stock consists
of 12 horses, 1 pony, 4 mules, and 6 oxen,
