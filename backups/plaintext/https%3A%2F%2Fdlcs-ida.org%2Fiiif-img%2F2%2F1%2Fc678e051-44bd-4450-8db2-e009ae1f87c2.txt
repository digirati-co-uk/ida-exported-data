Leupp Indian School& AgencyLeupp, ArizonaNarrative.Section 1Allotments.At the present time the Indians tenure of the lands under thisjurisdiction is such that trespass cannot be prevented or punished.However there has little been done as the railroad lands arein the hands of responsible lessees who do not try to take the bestof the situation but work in amicable relations with the Indians.Throughout the Jurisdiction there had been 638 allotraentselections made none of which have been patented to the Indians. Asthese were made in 1910 and nothing has been done with them sincethe work will all have to be gone over again and will require aboutas much work as the original selection., Deaths and births haveentirely changed the situation.Of course the Indians never should be allotted grazing landsin this desert country under the present law as no one would fora moment maintain that the law was passed with the deliberate intention of doing the Indian an injustice.Now since the Congress, at the behest of the statesmen ofArizona and New Mexico, made it the law that there should be no moreIndian reservations created in these two states, and no additions toexisting ones without Congressional approval, let Congress do plainjustice to the Indian.And plain justice is to make the area of an Indian allotmentin a desert grazing country of sufficient size to carry out themeaning and intent of the provisions of the general allotment actfor the securing of homes to those Indians living on the publicdomain.STEPHEN JANUSSuperintendent,
