OSCHOOLSANNUAL REPORT? 1924Page 4NARRATIVEPUEBLO BONITO.The school problem is being solved in the Navaho countryslowly new plants are being built and others enlarged andat this sohool wnen the sleeping porches now under constructionare finished, will have capacity for 350 children. Thereservation schools should maintain up to and including thesixth grade works If any reservation school in the Navahocountry is not equipped to do the prevocational Industrialcourse they should be speedily equipped and children seldomtransferred to the non- reservation schools while in theabove grades.The Indian parents have protested vigorously abouthaving to send their children away from the reservation, whileso small even if the go into 3rd and 4th grades and havetold me that they would oppose the sending of children nextyear. This protest was made here at the agency in an openmeeting and was carried up the Tribal Council at theirlast meeting held at Shiprock and in my opinion the officeshould give more consideration to the wishes of the parents.Last year we were required to send 54 boys and girls to otherschools and we have received notice to send 82 to AlbuquerqueSherman Institute and to Ha skell and during the monthof June 39 have been sent to Albuquerque, 6 to Sherman and10 to Ha skeli, others will go to Albuquerque later and overthe protest of the parents. During the present year we havehad a very hard time trying to keep all departments in a presentable and sanitary conditions with but few boys and girls largeenough to work and with all the larger ones transferred thecoming year will be harder with many more small ones anda less number large enough to work ana with little or notraining. with this condition to face the reservationschools should be equipped with every labor saving devicethat can be installed possible.
