Statistics.6-1142UNITED STATESDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIORINDIAN FIELD SERVICEEastern Navajo Agency,Crownpoint, N. Mex.,July 27, 1929.Commissioner of Indian Alfairs,AUG-11929OFFICEOFINDIANAFFAIRSRECEIVEDWashington, D. C.Dear Mr. Commissioner:office letter dated July 23rd, Statistics, just received. No actual number of births and deaths can begiven for this jurisdiction as it is impossible to keepin touch with the families even by districts to obtainthis information promptly, and our field men learn ofdeaths more often than births, but as fast as their otherwork will permit they visit homes where births are reported and properly footprint, name and number newborn, andthe information as to deaths is more common. Therefore,we secure a greater number of death certificates thanbirths, though in reality the births exceed the deathrate as there has been no epidemics throughout the Indlan country which would increase the number of deaths,and we believe that according to the ratio of births anddeaths, 199 births and 157 deaths would be fairly accuratethough this notation, of course, does not appear on thestatistics for the annual report.It should be borne in mind that this tribe does notlive in pueblos and it is impossible to keep in closetouch with every family in order to have this informationcorrect and down to date. If the Indians themselves couldonly see the importance of doing their part in furnishinginformation and bringing birth and death information tothe office, or field men, it would simplify matters agreat deal. Some of the Indians have already interestedthemselves in the importance of this work, but the majorityas yet do not see any necessity for going out of their wayto give such information which is so necessary that ourcensus records may be kept current at all times.:
