equipped with the most necessary items of equipment.The reimbursable livestock and equipment that hasbeen purchased for the Indians is being well takencare of and is greatly appreciated by the purchasers.Many Indians have obtained equipment and livestockthrough the benefits of the reimbursable fund whootherwise would have been unable to obtain same. TheIndians are not suitably equipped with work teams andthis is a matter which will receive attention in the verynear future. They howe ver, are able to accomplish whatmight be termed miracles with the small ponies they ownand until such time as their needs in equipment can besupplied it is deemed advisable to provide such equipmentbefore the matter of work horses is taken up. It isbelieved that the reservation should be fenced, this,however, cannot be accomplished until such time as theIndian land can be placed in a solid block. A number ofplans are in mind for the construction and reair ofvarious reservation roads, these plans to be carried outas rapidly as funds permit. The Indians are required todo a certain amount of road work each year withoutcompensation. This requirement meets with the generalapproval of the Indians and they are always willing todonate labor because they realize the benefits which theythemselves derive from the construction and repair of theroads. It has been stated before that one of the greatestneeds of the Indians of this reservation is the developmentof water. A considerable amount of work has been done alongthis line during the year, but it is hoped that much morecan be accomplished during the coming year. There aremany springs which can be developed and at parts of thereservation it is hoped that wells may be drilled andwindmills installed. Only a few allotments have been madeon this reservation and on these allotments practically noimprovements are found. This condition is due to the mannerin which the Indians must necessarily live, it being impossible for them to establish permanent homes because ofthe necessity of their moving from one part of thereservation to another to obtain sufficient grass or waterfor their sheep. No allotments are leased on thisreservation.It is our aim at this time to encourage the Indiansto decrease their flocks on account of the over grazedcondition of the range. The tribal herd has been builtup and improved to such an extent that we hope to be ableto provide a number of the Indians with a few ewes withinthe next two or three years. Considerable time is requiredto improve the quality of the sheep since it is necessaryto increase the wool clip without detracting from thehandiness and thrift of the Nava jo sheep This matter is- 2.
