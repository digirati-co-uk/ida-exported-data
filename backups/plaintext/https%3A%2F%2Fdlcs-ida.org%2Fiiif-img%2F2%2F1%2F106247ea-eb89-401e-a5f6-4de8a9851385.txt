-13This small area is not surprising, as it has beenfound by experience that very light gravity oil is foundin" small packages." True, the oil is of exceptional gradeand will bring a good price undoubtedly, but it will notlead to development in any way comparable to activitiesin the Wyoming, Oklahoma or Texas fields.It is possible that some time in the future a deep testto the Pennsylvanian will be made on Hogback and otherstructures in this area. Should a good grade of oil befound in large quantities in the Pennsylvanian or upperhorizons below the Dakota, the San Juan basin will probablybe the scene of greater oil activity. It is the opinion,however, that if the State of New Mexico is to gain prominence as an oil producing state, the production will haveto be secured from horizons below the Dakota sandstone.DRILLING IN HOGBACK FIELD.The character of the formations in the Hogback field issuch that no difficult drilling is experienced. For the mostpart, after the drill penetrates the Tocito' sandstone on thesurface, nothing but a compact shale( Mancos) is encountereduntil the Dakota sandstone is reached. There are, however,a few sandy horizons within it and also a thin limestone bedwhich is the equivalent of the Greenhorn limestone ofColorado This bed is not logged in all the wells, however,All of the beds mentioned hold up well and practically nodifficulty is experienced due to caying hole.Drilling with the Dakota as an objective may be donesatisfactorily with either National, Star or other portabledrilling machines, as the depth to the Dakota is only from772 to 800 feet on top the structure. If satisfactory progress is made a well can be completed within ten days ortwo weeks.It is the custom to set about three join ts of conductorpipe through the Toci to sandstone, if possible, and cementthis string with 10 sacks of cement to exclude surface waterand any seepage that may be found in the Tocito. It is foundthat 10" or even 8+" conductor pipe can be set and the wellfinished with a string of 6-5/ 8 or 5-3/ 16" pipe as the oilstring.Considerable difficulty has been experienced by the fieldmanagement in finishing some of the wells, due to the character of the Dakota sandstone and the impossibility of forecasting the conditions to be encountered.
