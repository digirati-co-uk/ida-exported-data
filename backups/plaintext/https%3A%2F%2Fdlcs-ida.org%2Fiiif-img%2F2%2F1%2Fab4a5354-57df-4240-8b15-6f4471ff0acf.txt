The class of 2011
started the year off
with a long assembly.
Everyone was running
around trying to find
their classes and
getting lost. Once
things cooled down, the
7th grade students
began making new
friends with other
students from all
grades. Planning for
homecoming was fun.
Through the good and
bad times and all the
long, hard classes we
stuck together.
STOOOOOOOO
