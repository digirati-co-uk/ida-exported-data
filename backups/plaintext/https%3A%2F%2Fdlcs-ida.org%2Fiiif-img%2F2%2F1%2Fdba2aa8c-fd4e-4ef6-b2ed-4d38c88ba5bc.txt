6. Our most urgent needs for continuing Medical work
is as follows:
a. A good physician, one who can do surgical work and
operate a hospital. A new Sterilizing machine handling
dressings, pans, instruments, eto, The hos pital re
painted inside and a few alterations made to make the
work handier and more effective with less work.
7.
Our four field matrons have had fine success and are
doing fine work among the Hopis, with the assistance of
medicines from our hospital and the physicians when we
have them. They have the friendship and co- operation of
the Indians. They prevent many deaths among the babies,
especially and are continuously working for better
health and home conditions.
8. The Missionaries and Field Matrons effectively work
together. There is fine cooperation among these people
to the great benefit of the Indians. This is especially
among the Hopi. I wish we could have such work in the
interest of the Navajos, who would appreciate it.
9. Field matrons make personal visits each week to the
homes of every Indian in their charge or at their villages.
Besides this they give medical attention to all sick
people the physician does not reach and handles a laundry
for bathing and washing among the Indians. They also
teach sewing and encourage better sanitary conditions.
10. Our field- matron service is not to be criticised it
is more than first class and satisfactory. If I was to
offer any criticism it would be that we do not have
as many field ma trons as we should have to give the
service to Navajos as well as to Hopis. It is impossible
to use the Hopi field ma trons for work among the Navajos,
01 course, many Navajos' wants are attended to by these
field matrons but there is no obganized efforts to ad
minister to Navajos as there now is to the Hopis.
Our field matrons happen to be worth their salary and
greatly interested in the ir work and the Indians.
