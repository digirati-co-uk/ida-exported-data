OHopi 7.6. Our most urgent needs for continuing Medical workis as follows:a. A good physician, one who can do surgical work andoperate a hospital. A new Sterilizing machine handlingdressings, pans, instruments, eto, The hos pital repainted inside and a few alterations made to make thework handier and more effective with less work.7.Our four field matrons have had fine success and aredoing fine work among the Hopis, with the assistance ofmedicines from our hospital and the physicians when wehave them. They have the friendship and co- operation ofthe Indians. They prevent many deaths among the babies,especially and are continuously working for betterhealth and home conditions.8. The Missionaries and Field Matrons effectively worktogether. There is fine cooperation among these peopleto the great benefit of the Indians. This is especiallyamong the Hopi. I wish we could have such work in theinterest of the Navajos, who would appreciate it.9. Field matrons make personal visits each week to thehomes of every Indian in their charge or at their villages.Besides this they give medical attention to all sickpeople the physician does not reach and handles a laundryfor bathing and washing among the Indians. They alsoteach sewing and encourage better sanitary conditions.10. Our field- matron service is not to be criticised itis more than first class and satisfactory. If I was tooffer any criticism it would be that we do not haveas many field ma trons as we should have to give theservice to Navajos as well as to Hopis. It is impossibleto use the Hopi field ma trons for work among the Navajos,01 course, many Navajos' wants are attended to by thesefield matrons but there is no obganized efforts to administer to Navajos as there now is to the Hopis.Our field matrons happen to be worth their salary andgreatly interested in the ir work and the Indians.
