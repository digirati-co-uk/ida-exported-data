Sir:
Indian Office post- card dated August 6, 1917 received,
acknowledging receipt of my Statistical Section of the Moqui
Annual Report for 1917, and transmitting the request for
Narrative Section and Census also.
I wish to report with great regret that necessary routine
matters connected with the Moqui Indian Reservation, the Indians
thereof, their business and interests, and the large correspondence
relative thereto( including court business, the Snake Dance, and
the recent visit of Chief Special Officer Larson) have about snowed
me under. This Moqui Agency office has now neither Stenographer
nor Property Clerk. The Chief Clerk can attend to the new
financial system and routine office matters only, and should not
be expected to cover more ground. It is quite impossible for
the Superintendent to be at court, then devote a week to Indian
dances that must be supervised, attend to liquor investigations
( a reservation situation that is of the foremost importance), and
at the same time keep abreast of all correspondence, including
a Narrative Report of many pages and a census of nearly 3,000 names.
This situation is regretted, but unfortunately it is a condition
and not a theory. This letter is being written at three o'clock
in the morning, an hour at which I fancy there are few persons
stirring in the Indian Office. Just as soon as the Narrative
Report may be dictated and the corrected census placed in the
hands of a copyist, every effort will be made to file these
belated reports. It is respectfully stated too that court work
will within a short time necessitate my turn ta Phoenix or
Prescott, Arizona, that a number of Cases may have attention.
Respectiuni
share
Esta
Superintendent.
