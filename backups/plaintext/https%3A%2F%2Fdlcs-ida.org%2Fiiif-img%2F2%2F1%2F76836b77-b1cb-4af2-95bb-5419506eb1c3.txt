FORESTRY.
There is no timber on the Moqui Reserva tion worth considering
in this section. It should be noted, however, that the Hopi Indian
18 sadly distressed at times because sufficient quantities of lumber
and such home- making materials cannot be furnished. Provision
should be made to cover this.
