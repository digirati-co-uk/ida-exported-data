4( 26))Therefore theblankets brought an average price of$ 4.65 each.figures given in Annual Reports for the fiscal years 1912, 1913,and 1914 were over estimates, in that the former figures supplied byIndian traders were more than twice as much money value as the actualstatistics for 1915 showed.Considering that some Navajo blanketsare sold over the reservation it is not unreasonable to report thatyearly the Moqui Indian Reservation produces about$ 24,000 in blankets.There is no indication that the guaranteeing system has eitherincreased the price paid to Indians for blankets or encouraged theIndians to weave better blankets.The sections of narrative reports devoted to Forestry, Irrigation,Allotments, Contracts, and Sales do not apply on the Moqui IndianReservation.Very respectfullySuperintendent.Yoqui Agency,Keams Canon, Arizona.
