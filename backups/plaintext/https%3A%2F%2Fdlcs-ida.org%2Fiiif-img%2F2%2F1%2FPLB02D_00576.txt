Taking up very briefly the priorities of the two grantsinvolved, the Leroux Grant was made in 1942, P proved by theSurveyor General in 1861, o onfim ed by Congress in 1869, andapparently patented in 1909 or later. The art in on Grant wasmade in 1916, confirmed by the Court of Private Land claimsin 1892, and later patonted. The maps in evidence show thatthe two grants, although not actually 1dentical, are verynearly so; that they lie pract foal by one on top of the other;and that the Tenorio traot 1ies entirely within the LerouxGrant, who oh was the first one confirmed, and partly withinthe Martinez GrantFrom the foregoing it is perfectly olear that the Courtof Private Land claims had no jurisdiotion to confirm theMartinez Grant at all. Saotion 13, paragraph 4, of the Aotof 1891, 26 stat. 854, establishing that Court reads:" Noolad in shall be allowed for any land the right to which hashitherto been lawnally acted upon and deep aed by Congressor under 1 ts authority." This was construed and applied inLas Animas Land Grant Company vs. U. S., 179 U. S. 201. Theconfirmation of the Martines Grant and the patent andthere onare therefore soloss to defendan ts, and that grant in this courtmust stand on its own merits as an unconfirmed Spanish grantThe curious situation resulting from the extraordinary overlapof the two grants and the carlor cont1 mation of the latergrant was noted and a commented on by the Scorsetary of the Interioron pp. 16 and 16 of his decision( PiSt. Mix. 6), where he statesthat the priority between the two is a matter for the courts todetermineIf it were important to plaintiff' s case, it could bestrongly argued that the confirmed Leroux Grant takes precedeno.Over the invalidly confirmed artiaes Grant.
