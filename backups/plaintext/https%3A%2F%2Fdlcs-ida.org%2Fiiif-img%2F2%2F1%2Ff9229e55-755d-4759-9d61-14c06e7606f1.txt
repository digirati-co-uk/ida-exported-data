8-34The Gypsum Creek anticline is traversed by twodike systems parallel to the axis and the test wellis located between these two dikes. It isn't believedthat the dikes play a part in condemning the structure,as the formations are normal at their contact with thedikes and are probably of pre- Pennsylvanianage. Theymay, however, have cut off accumulation at the top ofthe structure. This point could probably be determinedby drilling a shallow hole to the 500 foot horizonwhere the oil show was encountered, but outside thearea enclosed or bounded by the dikes.In the old San Juan field to the north productionis encountered in sands, which the Gypsum Creek testmust certainly have penetrated.CONCLUSIONAs set forth in the introductoryremarks at thebeginning of this paper, the main object of presentingthe facts contained herein, is to set forth as fact allof the important points in regard to development in theShiprock district of the Nava jo Reservation, and indoing so the Bureau of Mines hopes to be of furtherassistance in the development of the basin, and moreparticularly, the Nava jo Reservation.There are a number of wells now drilling on landoutside of the reservation, but to incorporate into thisreport a description of such operations, would be beyondthe scope of the present report and will necessarily bepassed by.
