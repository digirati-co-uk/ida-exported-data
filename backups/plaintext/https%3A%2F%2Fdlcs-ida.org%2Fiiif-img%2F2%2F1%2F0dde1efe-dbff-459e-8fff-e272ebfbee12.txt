-23the well to flow. This feature may be taken advantageofshould increased productionbe desired from this well.DEVELOPMENT.Up to the present time four wells have been drilledon the Rattlesnakestructure.Well No. 1 when first located, was believed to bevery close to the top of the structure and was locatedin the Swt of Section 1, T 29 N., R 19 W.Recent carefulinspectionmade by the writer, however, shows that thetop of the structure( on the surface) is in realityabout1600 feet west of No. 1. This increasesthe size of theapex of the structureconsiderablyand indicated that No.1is an edge well perhaps, particularlyso, when No. 2locatedjust 900 feet from No. l securednothingbutwater in the Dakota.At the presenttime it is not known just how largethe pool of oil is in the Rattlesnakefield, but development extendingover the next few months will determinethis, It is believed, however, that it will be a pproximately 200 acres in extent.Well No. 2 is located 990 feet east and 660 feetsouth of Well No. 1 and 15 feet lower structurally( basedon theTocitosandstoneon the surface.) In reality,based on the Dakota sandstone, it is just 4 feet lowerstructurally.No. 2 reachedthe Dakota at 810' and found 25 feetof dry sand before encounteringwater. A slight show of oilwas encounteredat 870 feet and this was tested out byrunning casing and shutting off the water, but no more oilwas found. This show of oil was responsiblefor the exaggera ted report broadcastedto the effect that a 500 bbl.well was drilled in. No. 2 was deepenedthrough the remainderof the Dakota group to make a test well and wasstopped at 1040 feet, after the top of the green McElmoshale was touched.A mild sulphur water is present in the Dakota in No.2and it rises to a point 60 feet below the surface of theground. The well is being pumped as a water well for development purposes on the lease.No. 3 locationis 660 feet north and 330 feet west ofNo. 1, closer in toward the top of the structureand secureda flow of 30 barrels at 825 feet.The top of the sand is 820.
