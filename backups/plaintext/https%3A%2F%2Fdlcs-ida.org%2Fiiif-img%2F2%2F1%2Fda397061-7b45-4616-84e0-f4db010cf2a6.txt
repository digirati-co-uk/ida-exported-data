,
Taos, N. M.
Dear Sir:
I leave here for Jomoz on the oth inst., and will not be
home till the one of the 14th. Judge- Morie and party will start for Taos
on the 14th. Court' opens there on the 16th. The suit against
the pueb
lo will probably como up. I have seen Judge Abbott, and instructed
him
what to do, and what concessions
to grant. You had also best attend the
sessions of the court and look carefully after the intorsts of the Inds.
I think the paeblo will win all that is fair, and that the people of
Taos must be content
with about what they are now getting
.
I am very respectfully
,
q
faoeren
Superintendent.
