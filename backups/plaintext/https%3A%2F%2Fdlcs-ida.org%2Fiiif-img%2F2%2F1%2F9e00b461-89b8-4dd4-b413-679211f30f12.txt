NARRATIVE
1919
Section VI
Allotments
Jicarilla
Agency
New Mexico
Allotments were made to 845 Indians shortly after
Executive Order set apart the Jicarilla reservation.
These allotments were cancelled in 1907 and in August
1909, a new schedule of 795 names was approved covering
354,294 acres.
The timber remained tribal property and
moneys derived from the sales as deposited as tribal
funds.
Agricultural allotments vary from two and one- half
to ten acres and grazing allotments from one hundred
sixty to four hundred acres.
The younger Indians who have no allotments show
but little concern as yet but it is certain that the
promotion of individual herds and a utilization of the
agricultural area's for forage production will bring
about a change in a few years.
The south addition
is all tribal and may or may not be subject to allotment.
There is little if any available areas near in the public
domain that could be so utilized,
