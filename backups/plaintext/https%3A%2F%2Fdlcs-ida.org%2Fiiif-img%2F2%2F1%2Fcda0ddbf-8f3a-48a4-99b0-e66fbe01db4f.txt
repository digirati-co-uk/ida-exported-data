Page 13.Loupp, Arizona.Section IV--- Industrios.( oont.)Only few of the Indians are dAng any attentionto fono Ing, and those usually have only the orudont sort toprotect their orops. One of the greatest needs of thisAgonoy 18 wire that can be given the Indian to buila fonosfor orop protection. The roads over the reservation are verybad, and a few goal roads are much needed, and it is believedthat 11 the Indiane could be given the work of busia ing suonroads( under the supervision of a good man), and, they werepaid for such work with wire, with whdon they could fonoa intheir orope, the influence would be very uplifting and boneflotal.There are no allotments on the reservation, but somefive hundred of the Indians that are under the supervision ofthis office have been allotted land that is just beyond theboundary, though those allotments have not es yet been approved.There are but few improvemente on these lande, as only a few ofthe Indians have any houses, as they are constantly movide fromplace to place in search of new grazing spots for their flo okeof sheep, their cattle and other stook. It is not thought thatthere stook is either inoreasing, or decreasing in numbers, andpractically no improvement has been made in the quality. Thisis a matter that needs to be brought to the Indians attention,as it is a fact that their sheep do not sheer more than aboutone- third what the better breeds wi11, and their size is accordingly small. No provision is made by the Indians for feedingthrough the winter, as their stock can always get go od grazingto carry them through the cold weather.
