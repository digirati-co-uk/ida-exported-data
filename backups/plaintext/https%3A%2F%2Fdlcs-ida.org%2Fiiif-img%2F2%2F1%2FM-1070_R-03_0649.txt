Action of the Indian Bureau to
be noted in this column.
ing good mechanics.
The books and accounts I examined and found to
be in the most perfect order, under the keeping
of Mr. Gould, a most excellent clerk.
After spending one week at the school, I in
company with Capt. Pratt, visited the boys and
girls who had been placed out among white people.
Those I visited were mostly in Lancaster and
Bucks Counties, Pa., and Cecil Co., Md.
I found they all had good homes and were with
thrifty industrious families( mostly Friends).
The children were all healthy and contented,
making good wages, and their employers well
pleased with them
. I desire particularly to
call your attention to this part of Capt. Pratt' s
work. To me, it is the greatest stride I have
seen in the service towards solving the problem
of Indian civilization.
Respectfully submitted,
