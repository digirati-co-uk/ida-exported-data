Action of the Indian Bureau tobe noted in this column.ing good mechanics.The books and accounts I examined and found tobe in the most perfect order, under the keepingof Mr. Gould, a most excellent clerk.After spending one week at the school, I incompany with Capt. Pratt, visited the boys andgirls who had been placed out among white people.Those I visited were mostly in Lancaster andBucks Counties, Pa., and Cecil Co., Md.I found they all had good homes and were withthrifty industrious families( mostly Friends).The children were all healthy and contented,making good wages, and their employers wellpleased with them. I desire particularly tocall your attention to this part of Capt. Pratt' swork. To me, it is the greatest stride I haveseen in the service towards solving the problemof Indian civilization.Respectfully submitted,2989,I87.Ald.Chief Indian Division.
