As part of the family of the Santa Fe Indian School, it was an honor being appointed to the
School Board by the Governors of the Eight Northern Indian Pueblos and most of all it is a
pleasure serving you as President of the School Board. We, the board would like to thank
you the students, administrative staff and faculty of Santa Fe Indian School for allowing
us the pleasure and privilege of being a part of your family.
As you venture into the world, take with you the lessons learned, the friendships made and
the future of your families and cultures. Many of you have grown to young adults here at
Santa Fe Indian School and the faculty here has provided guidance and advice, take with you
all that has been shared with you and taught to you. In turn, share and teach others.
Our forefathers have been fighting a battle for hundreds of years to protect our culture,
language and customs, our way of life. Remember as you continue your journey in life, the
sky' s the limit; anything is possible, once you set your mind to it. Never forget who you
are and where you come from and most important, do not forget your people.
Continue to learn as much as you can, education is the key. Bring the education,
knowledge, and skills home to help protect your people. You, the students of Santa Fe
Indian School, have become and will continue to be a force to contend with. You are Santa
Fe Indian School, our past, our present, and our future. A future we can all be very proud
of.
