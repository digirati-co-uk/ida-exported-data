can not be successfully treated in the pueblos and should be sent to
a properly equipped trachoma hospital established in Albuquerque
May 20, 1925, and authorized to June 30, 1925.
It would not be practicable to establish temporary tent hospitals
for the treatment of adults and children and the instruction of children
ineligible for school. The money expended for such would be better
applied toward the establishment of a permanent general hospital before
mentioned as these cases would always be found as a general condition
and not as a temporary one; furthermore, children ineligible for
enrollment in schools for normal children are negligible in mumber in
this jurisdiction and could be sent with less expense to institutions
in the absence of a permanent hospital.
There is under the jurisdiction of this agency only one hospital,
it being the temporary trachoma hospital established May 20, 1925, in
Albuquerque. Albuquerque is the logical location of such a hospital
as the needs of the Northern Pueblos Agency where no trachoma units are
maintained could also be served here. More equipment is necessary.
This hospital should be continued as the response among the Indians has
been good and will continue to become greater as the reactionary spirit
and prejudice( which is the greatest hindrance to its usefulness) is
gradually broken down by the return to the pueblos of successfully
treated patients. The winter season will be the most successful for
this institution as during the crop season Indians are too busily em
ployed and in many instances are so situated that it is impossible for
