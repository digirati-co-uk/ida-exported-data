very much, and while I possibīy cannot or vll not insist on' yo
poople calling the Doctor to treat their stok ohtla- las- Inqm1)
quire you to permit the Doctor to disinfect all housons where a den
occurs. You will 899 that parontu leave all blankets and clothing-
the house after a death and that the Doctor is notified tha mº
disinfect the quarters effectuelly •
This is given to you as an order, and should you disoboy my re
quest in this matter, I fear that as the head officer of the swell.
