year is spent in comininity practices, ceremonials, fiestas,
visiting, idleness and consequent delinquencies, yet

A century ago Taos had its runters and trappers, and
from hunting and trapping were had meat for subsistence
and hides and furs for articles of dress, and the Taos
Indians yet treasure the buckskin and furs in their dress,

Ta os tales commendable interest in their school, and
the selection and organization of a school board from the
principal men has given new impetus to their interest, and
the cooperation with the school principal and teachers
insures a better school, happier children, and a more
effective program of education for the pueblo.
The hospital constructed some six years ago was for

the hospital and the health service and there is now need
for added capacity and the Indians offer contribution in
labor for the proposed construction.
