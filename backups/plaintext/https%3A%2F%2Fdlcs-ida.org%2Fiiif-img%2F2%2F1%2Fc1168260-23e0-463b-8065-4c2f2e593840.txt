posed to criticism
and direction
on our part. The re
imburgable
proposition
has never been heretofore
very
favorably
considered
by me, and I am not so sure yet
that it produces
results that justify its continuance
,
though I have given it some encouragement
during the
past year and expect to give it more during the present
year. The Office allowed me about$ 1100.00 last year,
all of which was spent for seed and implements
, and near
ly all has been turned over to the Indians under written
contracts.
When I began operations
here we had reimbursable
agreements
in force amounting to$ 6733.08. There were
over$ 2,000.00 that represented
delinquenoy
. In my report
of reimbursable
operations
for July we have agreements
in
force amounting
to$ 5758.70, only$ 1000.00 Ofwhich represents
delinquency
. We have, therefore, reduced the delinquenoy
over 50%.
The Indians are not provided with suitable work
teams for doing the heavy work, but I believe they have
a sufficient
number of suitable strength to do what work
they have to do.
These lands are all unallotted
and but very few
regularly laid out roads traverse the various grants.
There are, however, a good many miles of natural roads
running in various directions being governed by the topography
of the country, upon which a considerable
amount of work,
especially on the mountainous roads, has been done. The
Indians are not required to do road work without compen
sation, but they do do considerable work of this kind
without being so required, in fact, if they did not,
they would not be able to get over the roads themselves.
The water resources at Taos, Piouris and San Juan
are sufficient
though they are not intensively
developed.
Such resources at Santa Clara, San Ildefonso, Tesuque and
Nambe are not sufficient
for the needs of the Indians as
they are at the present time administered
. However, it is
believed
that these matters will be adjudicated
by the court
in the near future and that the Indians will be able to obtain
a sufficient
supply for all their requirements
. The supply
is entirely from creeks and rivers, Wells are used for
domestice
purposes. No springs are available
.
As before stated, all lands are unallotted
. The Indians
live in villages from which they go to and from their
