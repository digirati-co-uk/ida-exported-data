NON- RESERVATION BOARDING SCHOOLSanta Fe, New MexicoAnnual ReportNarrative Section1922Section IIIS CH O O. E SThe school year just past showed gratifying progressupon the part of the pupils and increased efficiency upon thepart of the school as a whole. The realignment of the course ofStudy in the summer of 1921 puts this school upon a more definitebasis than ever before. Heretofore, our highest grade( VIII)left a pupil stranded in the middle of the old vocational courseso that, upon completing that year of work here, he either had totransfer to S ane other institution in the middle of a course orelse drop out for good. Without any change in the number ofgrades we carry here, the new course makes it possible for apupil who finishes our highest grade here to stop at a definitepoint. That is, he finishes the Junior Vocational CourseThe number of pupils who finished our highest gradehere in June, 1922, was eleven the highest number by a marginof three that ever finished that grade at this school in any oneyear. I see no reason why the number in June, 1923, should notbe c onsiderably greater than this year. During the past year,the attendance has been constant and there were no serious epidemics to hamper the pupils' school work It is true that the"flu" epidemic of March, 1922, did shut off our academic work fora week, but that was the only disturbing influence of any consequence, and it was soon over Another thing that improves theaverage daily attendance, and therefore the character of the workdone by the pupils, is the fact that for the past couple of yearsnow, the pupils have been getting into school promptly in the fall.This has a tendency to:( 1T increase the number of pupils finishingeach grade each year;( 2) shorten up the time required for any onepupil on the average to finish any one grade;( 3) raise the averageage at which the pupils finish the several grades;( 4) decrease thetotal cost of taking any one pupil on the average through ourhighest grade, beginning with any given point below; etc., etc.In my Annual Report for 1921, I assigned the credit for this grat.ifying state of affairs, especially as regards improved averagedaily attendanceBoth the academic and the industrial instruction atthis school was given along the lines prescribed in the TentativeCourse of study, as modified by the revision of 1921
