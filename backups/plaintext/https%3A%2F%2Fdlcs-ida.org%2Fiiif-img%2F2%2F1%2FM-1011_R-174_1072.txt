- 8-In 1908 this reservoir was constructed at a cost ofseveral hundred thousand dollars and provides irrigation water for a large number of Zuni Indian farmers in the vicinity of Zuni village. By establishingadequate control methods or range livestock controlon the headwaters and the tributaries of the Zuniriver, and the cooperative construction of silt control dams with the Indian Irrigation Service, it isexpected that further soil erosion and the siltingof reservoirs will be considerably lessened.Under the present range conditions am the ZuniReservation it is essential that additional range besecured for the Indian livestock. In order that theIndians become more nearly self- supporting and lessdependent on the government, additional range land isneeded. The acquirement of the National Forest landand railroad lands lying within the boundaries of thereservation and the purchase of private ranch holdingsjoining the reservation along the souta boundarywould provide enough additional range for the Zunisheep so that much better range management practicecould be put into effect. This additional land isnot desired for the use of increased numbers of stock,but it is needed for the present stock, in order thatthe overgrazed ranges may be permitted to revegetatethemselves.
