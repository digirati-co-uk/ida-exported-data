In 1908 this reservoir was constructed at a cost of
several hundred thousand dollars and provides irri
gation water for a large number of Zuni Indian farm
ers in the vicinity of Zuni village. By establishing
adequate control methods or range livestock control
on the headwaters and the tributaries of the Zuni
river, and the cooperative construction of silt con
trol dams with the Indian Irrigation Service, it is
expected that further soil erosion and the silting
of reservoirs will be considerably lessened.
Under the present range conditions am the Zuni
Reservation it is essential that additional range be
secured for the Indian livestock. In order that the
Indians become more nearly self- supporting and less
dependent on the government, additional range land is
needed. The acquirement of the National Forest land
and railroad lands lying within the boundaries of the
reservation and the purchase of private ranch holdings
joining the reservation along the souta boundary
would provide enough additional range for the Zuni
sheep so that much better range management practice
could be put into effect. This additional land is
not desired for the use of increased numbers of stock,
but it is needed for the present stock, in order that
the overgrazed ranges may be permitted to revegetate
themselves.
