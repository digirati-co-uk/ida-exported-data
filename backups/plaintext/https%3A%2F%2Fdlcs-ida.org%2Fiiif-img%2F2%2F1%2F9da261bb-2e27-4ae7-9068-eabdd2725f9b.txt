- 2-Section 1..- Law and order- Continued.carrying out the physician' s instructions in treating trachomaand other diseases. The combined population of Sandia and San taAna is 291.The Sandia and Isleta Indians are greatly addicted tothe use of intoxicating liquors. These Indians are citizens andit is no offense against the United States statutes to sellliquor to them, but it is an offense under the territorial statutes and all such cases have to be grought through the territorial authorities. Special officers of the United States andUnited States Marshals have no authority to act in such casesand do not always seem capable of grasping the situation. It isbelieved that a farmer or laborer clothed with offioial authority as deputy sheriff and stationed at Isleta would be a greatpower in the suppression of the liquor traffic, bringing offendersagainst the territorial law to justice and improving conditionsin other ways. Isleta has a population of 1002 and the youngermembers of the pueblo indulge in drinking and disorderly conduct. If a portion of the appropriation for the suppression ofthe liquor traffic could be placed in the hands of the Superintendent and expended in the employment of a farmer or laborer,as above suggested, it is believed cond itions at Sandia andIsleta could be greatly improved.The other pueblos do not useliquor to such an extent and are more law- abiding and bettercitizens generally.
