They have never been furnished with anysupport by the Government.The Indiens generally, are fairly wellequipped with suitable farm equipment. They, havingpaid for all this equipment themselves, know its valueand are giving it good care.( a)The Indians are making good and proper useof live stock and other supplies purchased forthem from reimbursable funds.( b)The live stock and supplies purchased fromreimbursable funds have been very beneficial tothe recipients thereof. It has been practicallyimpossible for the majority of the Indians to getthese things under any other arrangement, as theyare too poor to purchase them and pay cash.( c)The Indians are fairly well provided withsuitable work teams. These are secured by theIndians without assistance from the government,as a rule. The horses are not very large but theyserve the purpose and can stand hardships betterthan improved stock.21
