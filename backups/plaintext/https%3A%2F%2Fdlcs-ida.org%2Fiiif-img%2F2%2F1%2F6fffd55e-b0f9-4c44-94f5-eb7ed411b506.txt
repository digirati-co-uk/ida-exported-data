In the interests of economy, safety and cleanliness, I want again to
urge the necessity of heating with steam and lighting with electricity.
In an institition of this kind heated with stoves and lighted with her
osene lamps, and practically no fire protection, the importance of these
improvements cannot be overestimated.
At least two large cistern should be constructed co collect a wote
to be used in cases of emergency.
Some adequate fire protection should be provided at once.
vised that one or more large tanks be orected at sufficient hight t
throw water over the highest building: sufficient pipe bs 118 at con
noction with the present system and cough nose be purchased to reach
all the buildings t'r om at least hvorauta.
I would also recommend
that the school be connected with the sty water works.
The cost of these improvements would be, approximately, as follo
