PUEBLO DE SANTA C. LARAYcrease by e: tinguishing the Indian title and giving thatland.A. The what31 Q. The decrease in the present water by confirmingland in the settlers and the water rights that go withthat land?A. In a general way I should say they did, because theposition taken by the Board, contrary to the theory of competent counsel, has all along been that the Indians have notnecessarily lost their priorities in their water because theyhave lost the land, and therefore if we had so considered inthiscase, the award possibly might have been somewhat different. However, the questionis not really pertinent in thiscase, except possibly toa very small degree,as to thewatersout of the Santa Clara creek. You should remember that themain irrigation in the Santa Clara Pueblo is from what iscalled the Santa Clara ditch, which is taken out of the RioGrande river about a half a mile above the highway bridgeand carried down to a pointnear the Pueblo and south of it,and is used exclusively for Indian irrigation. That is quitea different ditch from these two( the Española and the Bua.chupangue) thatWe have been talking about.Q. Yes, but the two that we have been talking about, including the Española ditch, do supply water for irrigationpurposesto a large part of this land west of theriver towhich the Indian titie has been extinguished. The españoladitch does supply that land with water, ie, that land theIndian title to which was extinguished!A. Yes.Q. And that ditch and the water in that ditch is of valueto that land the titleto whichwas extinguished!A. Yes.The difference in the character of cultivation between nonIndian claimants within thegrant and other farmers in theneighborhood would be reflected in a difference in thepresentmarket value.Q.
