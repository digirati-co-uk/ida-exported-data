Dregardless of race to resist change. Nava jos are satisfiedto do things as their fathers did them. Indian Service employees, too, are often content to do things in the old way.Thus our problem is two fold: to train ourselves to look forother ways of solving our problems when the old ways no longer suffice; and to train Nava jos to discover new ways to findanswers to their old problems.We believe that knowledge as such is useless, andto a Nava jo it is doubly useless. Knowledge must be carriedover to a successfully accomplished act which is of value tohimself, his tribe, and the United States. Thus educationmust be made functional.The actual teaching from our curriculum is done byusing activity units constructed by individual teachers, whouse the curriculum as a guide in planning their work.Our curriculum has stated the objectives sought.These ideals are some times difficult to be attained. Oneserious difficulty is in developing our present personnel todo this work in the manner set forth in the curriculum. Weare constantly working to overcome this difficulty by asystem of curriculum revision, which is really a system ofself analysis and self training in bringing individuals tothinking in common terms with the curriculum, and in developing their ability and willingness to make constructive changesin the educational plens. Thus we believe that surer resultswill be obtained in training personnel by this self- activitymethod than by handing down decisions which must be followedblindly without self- conviction of the value of the work undertaken by the school as a whole.We have had some experience in operating a schoolin a hogan. Our present school building was over- crowded in1932-33 and in 1933-34. To relieve this we needed more classrooms. Since none were available, and no money could be obtainedfor buildings, teachers and pupils decided to build their ownschool buildings. Rock was quarried by the pupils, and olddiscarded telephone poles served as roof poles. Using suchmaterials two hogans and a part of another hogan was built atno cost to the government. We needed more buildings. DestituteIndians working for rations provided the labor to build thewalls for two more large hogans. The roof of each was finishedwith materials and labor paid for out of a total grant of$ 100made by the Indian Office. Thus we have built two double hogansand one single hogan at a money cost of approximately$ 100.These buildings were used for an experimental school. Thesccount of this experiment is found in the report of Miss AlidaP. Martin. This work will be carried on again this coming year.We expect to have more teachers and classes involved in 1934-35than last year.
