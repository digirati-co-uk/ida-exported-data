25- HopiGambling probably is the most common criminal practiceamong these people, if you can call it a crime. It has been apermanent feature of their home life for many years, especiallyamong the Navajos. They gamble at all hours of the night and day,and in many ways, but only among themselves.Every native policeman is under strict orders toprevent gambling and to bring in the offenders. They are triedbefore the Navajo Council. Here again we are met with the greathandicap of having no authority or law back of us to prosecute thiswork or to give merited punishment to those caught gambling. Wedestroy all paraphernalia that we take possession of.So far as I know there has been no important decisionduring the past fiscal year by either state or Federal courts,affecting our Indians.There has been no new legislation enacted by Arizonaduring the past year involving liquor traffic among Indians.E.
