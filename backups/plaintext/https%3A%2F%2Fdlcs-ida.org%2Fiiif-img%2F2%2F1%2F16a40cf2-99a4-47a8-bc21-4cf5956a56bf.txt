Arithmetic
: It is generally
recognized
that some number
facts
should, in primary classes, be taught incidentally
.
The value
of the pint, quart, gallon; inch, foot, yard; ounce, poung;
come under this head. It seems to me that nention should' be
made in the curriculum
that the child should be given an op
portunity
to learn these facts through purposeful
activities
.
Spelling
: It seems to me that one of the objectives
under
spelling
should be," To become aware of phonic groups; 1.e.
words
containing
a common
phonogram
; as, man, pan, ran, can; each, peach, teach, reach; weigh, neigh
,, Å›leigh;
This does not mean that there should be formal
drills upon
phonics
as the term is generally
understood
. The child may be
come aware of phonic
groups through
reading
and studying
poems and rhymes
,; through
writing
rhymes
,
Without
conscious
effort he learns
to discern
similar
elements
in words
.
