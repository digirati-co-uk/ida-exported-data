Annual Report, Albuquerque, LOLO.Industries Section continued.- 3-OFFICE OOFINDIANRECEIVEDAUG2-1910AFFAIRSAll of these Indians have reached the goal of self- ampport; in fact, they have been supporting Thomselves from timeimmemorial. They can and have been encouraged to do the best inthe cultivation of their crops and care of their stock, but theone incentive to put forth greater effort among the Pueblos wouldbe the division of their lands and the allotment of them in severalty. This would be an inducement to each Indian to put betterimprovements on his land, better fences, and to cultivate it.Mbetter, to level it and prepare it for irrigation and crops andwould lead to its improvement.No stock of white men is grazed on tribal lands.The grazing areas are not fenced, forage is at timesscant and watering places scarce making it necessary to grazeover large areas and the cost of fencing same would be large.It would be a benefit to the Indians if all of their grazinglands were fenced in order to keep off the stock of others andpreserve their range for their own stock, but the expense of doingso would be large; however, the Acomas contemplate the fencingof a portion of their grant this year.There are no allotments among these Indians.One farmer is employed at Laguna and one at Acoma. Theirtime is consumed in looking after the general busi ness of theIndians, assisting with the delivery of property to the day schools,dipping sheep and giving advice, and the farmer at Acomita givesinstruction in irrigating and farming. Both farmers assist in keeping up the irrigation plants and the dams in repair.- 3-
