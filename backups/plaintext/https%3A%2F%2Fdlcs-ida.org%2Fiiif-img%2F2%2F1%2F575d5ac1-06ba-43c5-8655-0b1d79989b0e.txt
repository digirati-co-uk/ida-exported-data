Section 2.------ Contatta:The Mescalero Apache pupils practically all had the measlesand suffered more than any of the other tribes representedand three of them had to be sent home. The Navajos had thedisease in a severe form while the Pueblos suffered leastof all. A peculiarity of this epidemic was the large numberof running ears caused by it. Out of 65 cases of measles,twenty- five had this complication. It has been the customin the past to fumigate the classrooms, clothing and dormitories and this is being done at the present time for thepurpose of ridding all buildings of contagion.The sanitary condition of the grounds and buildingsis excellent. The employees as a whole unite in instructing the pupils in the matter of caring for their health.Although no acute cases of trachoma have developed,new individual towel containers are being installed in thedormitories.
