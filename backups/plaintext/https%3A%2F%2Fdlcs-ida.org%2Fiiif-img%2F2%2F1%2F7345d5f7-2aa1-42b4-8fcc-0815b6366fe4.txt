Dear Miss Sarre
I am in receipt or your kind letter of the 17th. inst.
The box to which you rster is. aere and Safe. I do not know how the boy
could have left it as he is one of the very best boys I know of.
I understand that his pay for freigating the wiele load will se held
dia
up"" until you receipt for this box. I am sorry for the boy
great deal for the beggarly parha
to get for the load.
I have no way or sending the box to you
but ir at any time you can fin
an Indian coning this way give him an order for the box and I w: 11
letave it.
bolieve that the Superintendent on this school is
is yet
your"
superin ondent also, but who your superintendent is to be
a question. No one has been sent to take ny piac
although he should
have been here weeks ago.
With best wish. I am most truly yours
Cito
Superintendent.
