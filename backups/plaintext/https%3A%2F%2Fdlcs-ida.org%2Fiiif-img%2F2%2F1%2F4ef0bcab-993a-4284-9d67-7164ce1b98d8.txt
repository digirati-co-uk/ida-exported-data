they say if a school was built there or at some other good point,
there would be no trouble in getting girls enough to fill it.
The fire protection consists of pails of water placed in the
halls, rooms, and dormitories; more could be added to the present num
ber now in use, thereby increasing the fire protection very materi
ally; it should be done. Since my arrival at this agency( 3
weeks ago) I have not seen any thing that would lead one to suspect
that a fire drill of any kind was required, none has been attempted,
when I called the superintendent's attention to" Education circu
lar No, 26, April 12th, 1899," he had several excuses to offer to ex
plain why the fire drills had been omited, he promised to have them
regularly in the future, but up to date I have seen nothing to indi
cate that he will ever have one.
Here is a school where a good female Indian teacher should be
employed, it would I think serve as a good object lesson of what an
educated Indian girl can do who has attended school and is compe
tent to teach, it would also prove that the Government gives those
girls that are qualified positions as teachers to teach Indian chil
dren, and that they are not called upon by the Covernment to allow
their children to attend school simply to please the Government, but
to show them that the girls especially can earn a living in some
other manner than herding sheep.
Sunday nights the children do not go into the dining roon to
eat their supper, they are lined up and marched to the dining room
door, where the cook and her assistants give each child two or three
sandwiches in their hands, they take them, and go any where they wish
to eat this cold hold out, much of the food is scattered over the
school grounds and is wasted.
I fear the automatic flush closets, and the needle baths will
not prove a success at this school, I doubt very much if the water
supply and pressure will be sufficient to enable them to work in a
satisfactory manner. The spring from which the present supply is
obtainedis 1 1/4 miles distant from the agency and school buildings.
