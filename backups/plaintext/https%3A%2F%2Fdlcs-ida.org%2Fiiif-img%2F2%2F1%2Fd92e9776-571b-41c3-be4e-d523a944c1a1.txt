and with their needs to give children who are 16 and 17 years old
when they reach this level more industrial work and less academio

smithing, shopwork, gardening, child care, homemaking, or praot

In Oral English, I think there should be definite objectives
to include much work on the pronouns and on past tenses of verbs.
Furthermore, I believe that there should be some definite oral Eng
lish standard and I would suggest Terman's 3000 word list for 8 year
old children because it is essential that the children have a large
oral vocabulary for suoceeding grades. Then, too, such a standard
will be of help to the teacher in checking up and evaluating the
English she is trying to bring tin through her units.
