On examining the ac
counts on file at this Agency I discovered that numerous items
did not agree with the original supposed inventory andør. Denni
son the Clerk admitted to me that they had been altered.
On September 30th 1898, Dr. McKey a very estimable lady,
submitted a report of the property and medicines which she had on
hand, which was absolutely correct, and shortly afterwards she
received some report which is now on filein her office and to
" A
which was added a large number of articles, which they preemptor
ily instructed her to take up on her.next report.
In looking
over her papers I asked an explanation of this matter and she
said she felt conscientious scruples about certifying to article
which she had not on hand and never did have.
I tolaner
not
to do so unless it could be shown that she was responsible for
them.
I find these irregularities existing more particularly
where there are sub- agencies and schools.
I have not selec
ted this particular Agency for special action on the part of the
Bureau, but I believe this system to be general, and that in only
very few cases a proper inventory is made or that said inventory
seldom agrees with the amount on hand.
I am aware that allow
ance must be made for dishonesty of Indians and employees by sman
articles disappearing, or in other words" lost", but this is
a matter of conscience and should be kept within purview of hon
esty.
I can imagine nothing more demoralizing than for a A
gent to require his clerk and Sub- Agent and others to certify to
things that they know nothing about and perhaps absolutely untrue.
