The pueblo is located on the Pojuaque river near its junction
with the Rio Grande and their irrigation canals built
centuries ago toolk water from the two streams. Periodical
floods, silt deposits, end shifting channels necessitated
considerable work for ditch and headgate maintenance. Non
Indians locating on the Pojua que river above San Ildefonso
have taken the surface flow of this stream and recovery of
underground water of about one and one- half second feet is
now their main source of irrigable vwater, water hardly
sufficient for half their cultivated areas. Probably no
pueblo has suffered more difficulties in development and
use of water for irrigation than has San Ildefonso.
Some thirty years ago the day school was established
at the pueblo with Esther B. Hoyt as teacher. An official
four years later reported on the school with enrollment of
21, average attendance 18. The report continued," The
quarters are particularly poor and the Indians an indifferent
set. The teacher has done better than another might have
done under similar circumstances."
Visit now the pueblo and talk with the internationally
known painters and potters and they will without exception
advise that Miss Hoyt was their first inspiration for their
revival of art and that her leadership and guidance with
them was surely" better than another might have done under
similar circumstances." The work of Esther B. Hoyt as
teacher for five years in this pueblo may be an incalculable
factor in their present day popularity in pottery, painting
and design, of their$ 16, 000 average annual income no less
than$ 12, 000 comes from their arts and crafts.
