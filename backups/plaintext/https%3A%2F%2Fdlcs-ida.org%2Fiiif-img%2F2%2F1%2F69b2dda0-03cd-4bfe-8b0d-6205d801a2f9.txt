Sootion III--- Schools
The Albuquerque Fraining Bohool 18 located within one mile of the
city limits of Albuquerque which has a population of 20, 000 and is on
the main line of the Atohison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The
school 18 in the very hoart of the Indian country and 18 the nearest
nonreservation school to the Navajo reseruation where 6000 children
are without school facilities. The homes of 4, 600 Pueblo Indians
are within 70 miles or 24 hours ride of the school.
A course for ten yoars work 18 maintained, providing for
kindoragrten, primary and eight regular grades. The grado work 18
equal to that of the city schools and enables our graduates to enter
the High School. Three of the 1912 olass have just finished the first
year of high school work with satisfactory grades and have been
advanood to the second which they will take next year.
The State Course of Study has been used as the basis of our work,
but on account of not having the books designated it has been
impracticable to follow the course literally. The outlines for language
reading and arithmetic have been modified to meet the needs of the
school.
The principal teacher and kindergartener are now preparing a
course which, it is believed, will more fully meet the requirements
of the school, when this is finished a copy will be submitted for
Odlice consideration
