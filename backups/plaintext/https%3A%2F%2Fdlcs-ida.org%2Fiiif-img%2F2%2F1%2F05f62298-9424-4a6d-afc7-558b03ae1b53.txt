Hi Seniors! I don' t know what to say except I' m glad we all
made it together. I know I wouldn' t be here without the help
and support of my friends and family. Thank you all!!!
Thank you to all the teachers who have helped so much
especially, Mr. Bentz, Mr. Stuber, Ms. Guerin and Mr.
Ericson. I may be far from SFIS in the future but the
memories of these last four years will always be with me. So
as they say in Germany
" Ich liebe euch! Auf Wiedersehen!!!"
