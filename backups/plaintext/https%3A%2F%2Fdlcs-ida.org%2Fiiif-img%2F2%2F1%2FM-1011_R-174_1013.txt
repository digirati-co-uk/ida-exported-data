Annual Report, 1931

20. We have a small sawmill and it is used for getting out ma
terials for bridges upon the reservation and for governmental
buildings, while a certain amount of sawing is done for the
Indians. The Indians generally put in logs which are sawed
for a small amount of toll.
21. The past year the Smithsonian Institute has excavated small
ruins upon the reservation. There are a number of these that
may be excavated in the future but it would appear that they
should be held within this section, or especially the State,
as removing them to the Smithsonian Institute scarcely seems
fair to the Indians in this section.
22. The Gallup Indian Ceremonial or fair is participated in by
all the Indian agencies in this section. Unless this fair can
secure a more sound financial rating it would appear that it
would be for the best interests of the Indians and Indian agen
cies to establish a strictly Indian fair from some central lo
cation.
23. A number of the Indians attend the Albuquerque Indian cele
bration as well as the Gallup ceremonial. They receive a fair
wage for their dances and exhibits but invariably they come
back to the agency without funds.
24. It is believed the suggestion made in answer to paragraph
22 should be followed by the agencies in this section.
25. As all of the Zuni reservation is tribal land it is all used
by the Indians and no outside stock, except trespass, grazes here.
26.( a). There is very little employment locally for the Indians
except their own operations. The government employs a few in
road making and small enterprises but not a sufficient number to
care for the unemployment.
( b) The Zuni Indians will not leave the reservation for work
although such opportunities are offered them. They would work
at Gallup if some enterprise there would offer them the opportu
ni ty. It is the opinion of this office that the government
should establish factories of some nature where the Indians in
this section could be employed.
