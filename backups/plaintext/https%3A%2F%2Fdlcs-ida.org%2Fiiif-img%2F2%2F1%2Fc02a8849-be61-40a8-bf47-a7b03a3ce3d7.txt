We made another page for the Health Books. The child
ren suggested several health habits that they should remember
to do this summer. They chose one of these to illustrate for
their books.
Marcelino and Kilguy worked on the chair. Thoy
stretched the skin across the back of the chair, and sewed
1t with strips of goat leather.
We wrote a few statements on the board about our
work, to put in our record book. Each child wrote something
of interest either about their work, or something that
happened outside of school to put in their diary.

We finished up the work for the year. We had
somo
Reviews about some of the things we had covered during
the year, that we wished to remember.
We completed our books, and got them ready to take
home. The girls seemed more anxious to take their work
home with them. Some of them asked to take the Manicuring
set we had used during the year. Each child had their own
orange stick and emory board for kooping their nails filed
and clean. The girls seem to take great pride in having
their hands and nail looking clean and pretty.
We fixed up our Hogan for the summer vacation,
Some of the children said," Goodbye Hogan. School."
