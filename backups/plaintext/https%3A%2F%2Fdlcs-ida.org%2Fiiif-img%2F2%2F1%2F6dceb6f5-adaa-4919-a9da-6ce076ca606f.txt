Lorenzo Medina, a Sia Indian, who is employed as laborer.
While Lorenzo was in school only five years, yet he has shown
sufficient interest to educate himself so that he speaks
excellent English and writes it as well. Lorenzo has great in
fluence with the older reactionary Indians, as he is a true
Indian as regards their traditions and seeks to preserve them.
He does his work well not only the common labor but assists in
the care of patients. Lorenzo has been of assistance in securing
patients who without his encouragement would probably not have
come to the hospital. It is the policy of Dr. Eilers to secure
the help for the hospital from the Indians, as it teaches the
Indian that he can do things, gives him financial reimbursement,
and gives greater influence among the Indians in the hospital.
