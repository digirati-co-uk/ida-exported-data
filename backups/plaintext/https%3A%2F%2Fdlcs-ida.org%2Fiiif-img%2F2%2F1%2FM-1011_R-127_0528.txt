Annual ReportHealth- 2.San ta Fe Schooland Agencythe women that her work becomes really effective. Amatron in any community of Indians, provided she possessesthe qualifications necessary in her position, increasesher power for good effective work in that community inproportion to the length of her residence I believe muchof the work done by the Zield matrons is of a naturo noteasily apparent or appreciated by the casual observer,especially during the first few months of their residencein an Indian community. In my opinion few women are fittedfor this work, and possess the inherent qualificationsnecessary for succes9. On this account I believe greatcare should be taken in their selection.One of the two field matrons established underthis agency during the past year was assigned to SantaClara, the other at Jemez. There are now three fieldmatrons in this district, one at San Juan and the othertwo as stated above, I blieve much good work is beingaccomplished by these women, and hope that funds may beavailable so that field matrons may be established during the present year at Taos and at Santo Domingo orCochiti.An additional position of physician for thepueblos of Santo Domingo and Cochiti was established during the past year on recommendation from this office Somedelay was experienced in filing this position, and on subsequent recommendation from this office the position wasleft vacant, as it seemed advisable to establish a physicianat Santo Domingo simultaneous with the opening of the dayschool during the present fiscal year, A physician stationedat Domingo or Cochiti will obviate the necessity of Dr. Brockwho is located at Jemez, spending a considerable portion ofhis time on the road between Jemez, Cochiti and Domingo,Those to last named pueblos have been and are now under hisCareThe matter of providing drilled wells with cementcaps and hand pumps for the pueblos, recommended in my lastannual report and subsequently taken up in detail in othercorrespondence, is st111 ponding.
