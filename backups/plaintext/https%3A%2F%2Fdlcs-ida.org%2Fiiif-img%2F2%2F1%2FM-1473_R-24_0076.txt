If you forgetto expand any flour from Jan. 2st to March sist, 14 becomes a verydifficult question now so far as correcting same. In fact I asinazgeest no way in which it can be dons. As I wrote you,* 11not be able to expend, about the 50s. 1bs. supposed to be on hand,and for which I receipted. If necessary, then, you may be obiteed to discontinue a full lunch, but you wu be expected to o*pend the flour in question, providing same is not too ma eh forthe number of rations during the quarter.Am I vae not in charge previous to April 1st, you will seethat I cannot well account for floubs during the 3rd er.Very respectfully,Superintendent.
