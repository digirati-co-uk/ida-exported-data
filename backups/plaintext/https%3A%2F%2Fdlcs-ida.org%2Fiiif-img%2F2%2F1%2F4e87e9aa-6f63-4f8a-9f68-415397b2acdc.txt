Dear Sir:
The foot- ball team will leave here Wednesday
the 25th at 3, 30. and
will reach Mesilla Park the morning of the 26th. This is the best we
can do, and is rather hard on the boys, as they will be up all night.
I can't tell how many 11 any of the people here will go with the boys.
The employes of the school can securo hall rates account Indian school
service
at any time.
As to an official
to represent
us- in the game,
I am unable to
tell at this time whether
we will be able to get one other than our
coach, Hugh Sousea. If possible, we should be glad to do so.
I send you the list of our players
on separato
page.
Respectfully
,
