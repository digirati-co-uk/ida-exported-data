Sana Po Mew Mexled. August 14 1899.
Supommandent Homes,
Sir:
I have the permiseler Af Ng Indian Agent Hadler to canvas fer
pupile for aur shoal wwwn ano pample* Kia agency. I understand
that there are a large number of Papeer Indian Children near you.
More indeed than you can
Accommodate in your school. Our school has
been somewhat enlarged and I am very anxique to fill it to its full
capacity at
as early a date as possible.
I am safe in saying that the
is not a better corps
of instructors in any school in the Indian
in our
Service than we have here. Without doubt we do as good work
classes, both industrial and literary, as is done in any other Govern
ind
ment school. As
to the moral and religious status of the school
es management, I will refer you to
the Paster of your church here
in Bantu P. and also to
the superintendent of your Haston at this
place. I will secure letters from both of them in a day or two and
transmit to you. If there is
a fair prospect of our getting desita
ble pupils frore your vicinity, will you kindly write me and in case
the chances of securing pupils are good, I will send a representativa
of the school te Tasean in the near future, Thanking you in advanse
for your kindness, am most truly yours
duperletendenta
