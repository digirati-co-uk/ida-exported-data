This means that all shop work would be subordinated to our agricultural program; all to come under farm shop and farm mechanic courses with trained men teachingthese courses.eWith the aid of our present school management, we have definite hopes of obtaining our objectives in the very near future.Plans for an extensive agricultural unit have been approved here and are now inWashington for final approval and allotment of funds. This new unit is to includethree modern classrooms, a laboratory, an office, a modern farm shop, adequate tooland implement sheds, horse quarters, hay room, and an animal judging ring.Our plans include another teacher of agriculture to enlarge our farm shop personnel. We desire to increase our agricultural holdings, and may do this by leasingthree or four hundred acres on the Sandia Reservation ten miles from the school foralfalfa and a sheep and beef cattle range.- ROBERT E.
