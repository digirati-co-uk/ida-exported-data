that

urged
that
the ot
could
not be upheld
as an indirect
condemnan
tion proceeding
because
eminent
domain
coulC only
be
exercised
for
public
uses
and
this, in his opinions
,
was not a public

said
paragraph
of Section
4 to mean
that
where
the Board
had decided
in favor
of the settler

the
Pueblo
was permitted
to retry
such
decision
in court
