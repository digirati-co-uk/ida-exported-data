Material was foundwherever possible. The amount of available material forthe STUDY OF NAVAJO INDIAN LIFE was very, very limited,and none was such as could be put directly into the handsof the children. Material was gathered from talks withIndians, people about the plant, government bulletins, oldalmost forgotten reports, ethnological books, and somefew reliable books about Navajos and other Indians.Thomaterial was rewritten, hektographed, and then given tothe children. This 200088itatod a great deal of extrawork, but it seems it was woll worth the trouble involved.The material for the other units was just as limited, ifnot more 80.Wherever related material could be used direct fromthe texts it was used, in order to give& balanced program.Spelling grow out of the needs of the children.Material for the lessons was gathered from the misspelledwords in written work, or from words asked for by thechildren.Individual olass dlotionaries were made in whichnew words and their meanings were kept.
