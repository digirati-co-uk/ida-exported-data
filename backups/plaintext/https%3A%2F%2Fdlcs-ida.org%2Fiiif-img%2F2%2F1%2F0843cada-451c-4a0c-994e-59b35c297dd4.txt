The above unit 200088itated the use of practical
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division,
and the use of one- hall, one- third, and one- fourth.
No partioular texts were used. Material was found
wherever possible. The amount of available material for
the STUDY OF NAVAJO INDIAN LIFE was very, very limited,
and none was such as could be put directly into the hands
of the children. Material was gathered from talks with
Indians, people about the plant, government bulletins, old
almost forgotten reports, ethnological books, and some
few reliable books about Navajos and other Indians.
Tho
material was rewritten, hektographed, and then given to
the children. This 200088itatod a great deal of extra
work, but it seems it was woll worth the trouble involved.
The material for the other units was just as limited, if
not more 80.
Wherever related material could be used direct from
the texts it was used, in order to give& balanced program.

new words and their meanings were kept. An effort was
made to see that they know the meanings of the most simple
words that ocoured in the work.
