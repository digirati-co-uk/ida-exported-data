guests and we hope that they
had a nice visit. Hope you
come back soon!
05 William A. Pacheco, SFIS
Above: Authors Ms. Silko,
Ms. Harjo and Mr. Ortiz visit
SFIS to read their work and
take time to visit with
students.
Below: The Native American
singer Star came to SFIS to
work with students on
developing their voices.
The Christmas Elder Luncheon is
always a special time at SFIS. The
students enjoy meeting the alumi of
SFIS and hearing stories about how
the school used to be. Most
important, it is a chance for the
students to serve and show respect to
the elders of their communities.
