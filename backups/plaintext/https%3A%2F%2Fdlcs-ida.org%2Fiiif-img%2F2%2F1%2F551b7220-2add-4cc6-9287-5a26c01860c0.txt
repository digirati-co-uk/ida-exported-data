What' s Your Most Embarrassing Moment In High School?
Miranda: During a V ball game against St. Mikes the team
and I were getting ready to change out in a locker room
that we thought belonged to the girls of St. Mikes, when in
fact it was the guys. Anyway, as we were getting ready, St.
Mike' s football team walked in on us. Talk about putting
your name to shame. OUCH!
Norma: It was during an honors assembly and I was
called down to receive my award. I was walking down the
bleachers, strutting like I was all cool, when I suddenly
tripped on my own foot, I staggered and almost fell down
the bleachers in front of the entire assembly. HA!

Kevin: I was supposed to be in my room for bed check
one time, but I wasn' t in my room. I was in my friends
room. So, one of the resident advisors was coming down
the hall and i' m like dashing left and right trying to find a
place to hide and there was no place I could find. At the
time, I figured my only option was to jump in bed with my
friend( I know guys) and I did. The R. A. came in and he
did his bed check, and he just happened to see the extra
lump( me) that was lying in a bed only big enough to fit
one. He came up and he pulled off the sheets and he saw
my friend and I in bed together. I made a bad impression
that night.

Matthew: One time during study hall I was messing around
with some of my friends in the living room at the dorm on
second floor, and some of the guys went out of the
outside for whatever reason. Suddently they came inside
running, so I turned around too fast to get out of the way,
and the first step I took was a fall head first into the floor.
That was the cherry on top of a weird day for me.
