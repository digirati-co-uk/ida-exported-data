Naturally, our biggest project each year,taking matters by and large, is the farm But, asalready indicated in this report, the fiscal year 1923saw rather meager results from our farming efforts,owingto the almost unprecedented drought. In July, 1922, allwater supply was cut off excepting what was actually necessary for cooking, drinking, bathing, and washingclothes This year, thus far, the outlook is more promising, and I fully and confidently expect that we shallat least have a rather bountiful crop of root crops nextfall- a thing which we did not have for last winter' sconsumptionThe conditon s as to farming at this schoolare much the same today as they have been for years andyears past. But little can be accomplished withoutirrigation water Dry farming might produce e a croponce in four or five yearsThis past spring I took out most of the oldapple trees, which were either dead from last summer' sdrought or else an unhappy choice on the part of theoriginal planter, and planted new ones. I hope in afew years time to have an orchard worthy of the nameAll fruits, root crops, and other farm and truckBarden produce at this school is devoted to school usaWe do not produce any where near enough for our needsand frequently have to buy additional quantities.
