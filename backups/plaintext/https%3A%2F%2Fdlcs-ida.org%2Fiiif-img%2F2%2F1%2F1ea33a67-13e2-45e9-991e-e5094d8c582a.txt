Santa Fe, X.M., July 28, 1924,-16-as I think they can, be persuaded to do away withuseless stallions, even though they be not affectedwith the disease, that would very materially helpthe situation. At one time numbers of such stallionswere slaughtered, and, with a little propaganda, I amled to believe that the Indians can be persuaded thatit is to their distinct advantage to consent to theeradication of numbers of these propagators of inferiorstock.seu Blaus–îrepart63293-24It may be said in regard to sheep scabies andthe dipping of sheep that the campa ign under the jointauspices of the Indian office and the Bureau of AnimalIndustry has been carried on in the last year with muchmore hearty cooperation and effectiveness than everbefore, and that were it not for the palpable lack ofcooperation on the part of the superintendent of theNavajo jurisdiction, -the infection could, in' all probability, be very completely cleaned up with in a yearor two more. This is a matter of the most vital importance, and that such cooperation has not been had.is quite evident from a study of the situation. Allof the other superintendents are working in closestharmony with the Bureau, but much of the effectivenessof that work is destroyed because it seems impossibleto secure the whole- hearted support of the superintendent in question. He seems to be constitutionallyunable to insist that any of his Indians who are loathto adhere to any of the regulations do so. Inasmuchas the Navajo jurisdiction is the heart of the wholereservation, this results disastrously in re- infectingneighboring herds on other jurisdictions and on publicdoma ine south of the Nava jo jurisdiction. The factis, as I am assured, that sheep scabies have beenpractically cleaned up in the whole state of New Mexicowith the exception of some counties adjacent to thereservation, and the state, as well as the Federal,authorities are very insistent that practically theonly present source of infection is Nava jo sheep, andI am convinced that this is true and that, with theproper continuance of the effective work already inaugurated and the right sort of cooperation in theTava jo jurisdiction, the whole matter could be cleanedup as stated above within a very reasonable time,whereas if this cooperation is not obtained, it maytake many years and the expenditure of very large sumeto6are all,the ortus saph.irnya, peminathan the diede bringin their sheess, bet4.do not bonsuffionis freeof employeestomake theffectionworkentirely
