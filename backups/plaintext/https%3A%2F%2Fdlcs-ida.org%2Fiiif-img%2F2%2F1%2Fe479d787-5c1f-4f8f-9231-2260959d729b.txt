sir:
In answer to Office Letter of May 20th 1898, Finance 28717, 1998
I have the honor to inform you that
as it will be lmpossible
to have
the work of re- roofing the ain school building finished before the
first of July, I will purchase the necessary materials
and push the
work as fast as possible between now and that ime, but it will be
necessary for me to request' en additionei authority after July Ist
to l'inish the work.
Tinners are very scarce in this sectior, hare being but one in
Santa Fe and it will be necessary for ma to send to Denver, Col for
some and I doubt if I will be able to induce any to come here for
80 short a job.
Very respectfully
,
