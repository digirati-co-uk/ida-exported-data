This hord produces good bulls forsale to other agencies and this spring o sold& bulls to Southern PueblosAgency, 2 to Northern Puoblos, and so bulls to the Northern Navajo Agency,all at$ 60. each.In addition to this foature, the tribal herd furnishesall the boot nocossery for the conduct of the institution.The sana torium has a large herd of high clasÄ± dairy stook whichsupplies all the milk roquided for the in titution and which provides botterthan 3 quartos of milk per day per pupil.Many of the Jicarilla Apache women make fine baskets and a few of thendo boadwork which is highly original and of unique color designs. They donot make any blankets, preferring to leave that to the Nava jou. Thos Indianswho do not have floclos large onough to occupy their full time, find otheremploynent on the roservation, in the sawmills or doing road work andwater development.

A good foundation hord,but a good bull to lead this herd is needed at once.This Jurisdiction has one farmer, one superintendent of livestock,and two stockman.
