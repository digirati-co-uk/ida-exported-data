A. Industry
.
During the winter of 1931 and 1932 the Jicarillas
lost 72% of their
sheep in a winter the like of which has never before been recorded
in the
history
of the Southwest
. Congress tery graciously
gave the Jicarillas
Tribe a loan of$ 50,000 to restock their reservation
,
Be twoen fifteen
and
sixteen
thoudand sheep were purchased
with this money and distributed
among these Indians in the fall of_1932. At the present time this loan
has been partially
repaid and the Jicarillas
. credit is being re- established
.
With the exceptionally
low price for wool and lands and the great loss to
the Jicarilla
flock masters in 1931 and 1932, the Indians
in the spring
of 1933 found themselves
in debt to the post trader, Mr. Emmet Wirt, to
the tune of about 75,000.00
. With the restocking
of sheep and the money
earned through IECW and other projects
, the Jicarillas
are again getting
back on their feet and last fall after selling their lambs, had reduced this
indebymess
considerably
.
B. 1.
Individually
owned flocks have improved
and increased
during the past
season
, We continue
the policy of instructing
and helping
the Indians in
tying fleeces and docking lambs, These practices
are almost universal
on the
reservation
now, this work being the main object of the stockman during
shearing
and labing season. This program will be continued.
Complete
sheep records, carried back as far as 1923, have been organized
and kept up for each Indian family, giving number of sheep issued, 1 silubs
rassed, lambs sold, thoir value, wool sold and value, and ewe lambs added
to flocks. These records furnished
a good basis for development
of the indust
ry and will be of great value from an administrative.standpoint
,
2. Tribal
Herd.
These flocks show about same degree of increase
as individually
- owned
flocks. The wool crop for this year has not yet been sold. When sold, it will pay some dividends
to share- holders
of" old Peoples' Herd."
3. Range.
Due to lack of moisture
during past season, there is not so much grass as ordinarily but there should be sufficient
feed for all sheep.
4. Water
and Fencing
.
A consideravle
number of wells and reservoirs
have been developed
on the reservation
during the last two years. More of this same kind of
development
id planned for the next year under IEC. It is felt that this
part of the range development
program should be pushed above allo thers
it being absolutely
vital to the livestock
industry
both in providing
abundance
of water for live stock and improving
range conditions
by stopping
the necessity for spot grazing. It is proposed to build a dam across the Ojito
or oh ter drainage of southern portion of the reservation
where water for stock
is particularly
needed. This will also act as a soil erosion project. Incident
aly, it will be also used as an irrigation
experiment
. At the present all
