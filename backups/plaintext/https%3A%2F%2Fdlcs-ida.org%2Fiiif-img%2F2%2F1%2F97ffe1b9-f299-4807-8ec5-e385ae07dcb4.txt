Class of 2006
From orientation to
graduation, we will never
forget, but cherish the good
times we had. From
basketball games to school
dances, we have shared tears,
laughter, and achievement.
No matter what we faced,
we faced it together, not as
friends or peers, but as
family. Together, we are the
Class of 2006 from the
Santa Fe Indian School.
