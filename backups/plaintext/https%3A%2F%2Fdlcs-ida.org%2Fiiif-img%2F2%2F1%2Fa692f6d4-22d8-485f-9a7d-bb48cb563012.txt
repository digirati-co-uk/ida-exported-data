Santa Fe, N.M., April 13, 1893.
3. R. P. Hall,
Albuquerque, N. M.
In the summer of 1891 you made me a steel wristpin for
our windmill, which I think I paid you for in cash later in the
888 son; then the Government re- imbursed rae on the 12th of December
2891. I had your bill, receipted by your clerk. The Department
takes exception to my account and requires a certificate troin
" the board of Directors
of the Albuquerque
Foundry and Machine
Company
.
As you are, and were at the time of this transaction, the
Que auner of the
company, I think the best way to satisfy the
Department
to have you signature
on these new vouchers
- both
in the receipt and also to the certificate
which is written
rear
the top of the vouchers. I would thank
you to sign these
pe
to comspond with voucher,
mars for me and make out a bill and receipt it also.
Very respectfully
yours,
Willem
Superintendent
