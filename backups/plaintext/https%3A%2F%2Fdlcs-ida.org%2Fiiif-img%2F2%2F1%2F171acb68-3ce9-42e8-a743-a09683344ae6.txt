Santa Fe, N. M., Nov. 22, 1903.
Supt. Alexander',
Sacaton, Ariz.
Dear Sir:
On the 9th inst. Domingo Pedro, a Pima boy from your reservation
from the village of Casa Blanco, ran away from this school. He had been
here
since Aug. 1900.
Prior to his running away Pedro had been in the
hospital for some time on account of sore eyes and some other trouble,
of which, I believe, the doctor was not certain,
He was in fairly good health at the time of his departure, which
occurred when I was absent. If he has reached the reservation, I should
be glad to have you notify me. I regret very much to have a boy run
away, especially from a good thing, and as it has
& demoralizing in
fluence on others, I generally try to get them back.
Very respeotfully,
Ver
dar
Superintendent.
