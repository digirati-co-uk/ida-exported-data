Santa Fe, N. M., Nov. 22, 1903.Supt. Alexander',Sacaton, Ariz.Dear Sir:On the 9th inst. Domingo Pedro, a Pima boy from your reservationfrom the village of Casa Blanco, ran away from this school. He had beenheresince Aug. 1900.Prior to his running away Pedro had been in thehospital for some time on account of sore eyes and some other trouble,of which, I believe, the doctor was not certain,He was in fairly good health at the time of his departure, whichoccurred when I was absent. If he has reached the reservation, I shouldbe glad to have you notify me. I regret very much to have a boy runaway, especially from a good thing, and as it has& demoralizing influence on others, I generally try to get them back.Very respeotfully,VerdarSuperintendent.
