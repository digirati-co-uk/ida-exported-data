The inorease was due to the Reclassifioation of Employees
which went into effeot July 1, 1924.
The Southern Pueblo Indians in general appreciate the fact that
their schools are good, or bed, as the case may be. They are helpful
and during the year just closed we have had very great success in mak
ing the school the community center. More careful supervision and
greater coordination is our plan for the future. To secure the passage
of state laws, under which the schools can be changed to public schools
and the government aid with tuition; should be our aim until the
Ir lians are finally citizens and taxpayers, and fully support them
selves. This could be hurried but will probably be a slow process in
New Mexico.
The efficiency of our schools during any year will be largely
affected by the fact that the teacher is on the job when school opens
and will stay there until the end of a term.
Our aim should be to
plan to keep each qualified teacher as long as practicable in his
first location.
