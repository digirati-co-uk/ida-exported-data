Middle School Promotion
Into
high
school!
A beautious day for the
middle school promotion
.
Many attended the promotion
for the SFIS boys and girls who
will leave middle school.
The speakers honored the
student body who are to
enter high school. These
young people are reminded
that they are our future.
Many of the eighth graders
received awards for academic
performance
Great job!
