The biggest highlight ofmy trip to Alaska was whenwe stayed at a light house. Itwas such a neat place. Youcould see almost everythingthat was around you. Whenwe first got to the lighthouse, we went looking forsea shells. We found a lot ofsea shells and starfish. Thenthat evening, we spent ourtime relaxing in a hot tub. Itwas a nice evening. While wewere in the hot tub, we sawsome sea lions swimmingnear the island. Then thenext day, when we were going back to the school, wesaw a baby whale. I got allexcited when I saw it. It wasmy first time ever to see awhale.â€” Doreen Baca.. One of the highlights was meeting new people, such asEskimos, Athabascans, Haidas, Tlinglits, Aleuts, and Russians.
