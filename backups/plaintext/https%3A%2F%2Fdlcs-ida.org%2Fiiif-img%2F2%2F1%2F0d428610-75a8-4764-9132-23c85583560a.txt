Kelley, whom I have recomended for the positienof Asst, Supt.& Physician, farms me that he will not accept thepositioningI therefore recommend that Dr. Harronn, of Santa Fe, whohas an application on file in your office for the position, be appointed School Physician, and that for the remainder of the yearve dispense with an Asst. Supt. I would suggest that the salaryof the Physician be fixed at$ 500.00, and that the School Carpenter, mr, Crichton, be paid an additional salary of$ 100.00, and tthat he be detailed to act as Surt, in the absence of the Supt..Mr, Crichtor is a very capable and trustworthy, and in every wayqualified to discharge the duties of Auste Supe.
