I am in receipt
of your
letter
of the 20th inst, in which
you
intimate
that I have
not treated
you fairly
by buying
meat of Mr.Bischo
ot this city for 8 cts a pound. I.want
to state that about June 25th, I
13.8 informed
that Mr.Slavens
of Kansas
City had the contract
to furnish
this sehool
with net beef the present
fiscal
year; as Mr. Yrigarri
hadi
informed
me that he would not furnish
mert any longer
than the goth of
June, I at once wrote to Mr.Slavins
agking him what arrangement
he had
made in regard to the matter.
Before
I had time to receive
a reply
from Mr Slavins, Mr.Xrisarri
informed
me that you had the contract
and
not Mr.Slavins.
He also told me that he would try to furnish
meat until
you could make a contract with some man at Santa Fe; he brought must on
or twice, and informed me that it was impossible
for him to get the boot
and suggested that I buy in open market. I bought from Mr. Bisoboft, bo
cause I could buy from him cheaper than from any one else in Santa en
Most of the time during the month of May, I had to buy in the apta mer
ket, Mr. Yrisarri being unable to furnish mest. I called upon th·ªç other
butahers and found that I could not buy for less than 8 1/2 ats; ang
shops wanted 9 ets. Most has been high hore for the last pix mobilitats
do not doubt that you and we wel waar u Low.# beste
