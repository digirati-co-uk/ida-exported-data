and to show the good use made of same it is only neces
sary to refer to their indebtednds at the end of the
fiscal year 1912, which was$ 18000 in the trading store
at this agency, and which has now been reduced to$ 12000.
They have therefore dwing the past year lessened their
indebtedness
$ 6000, and increased their personal effects
Very considerably. They also show an increase in their
stock, and are in much better condition than a year ago.
Funds are now available for the purchase of
sheep for these Ind ins, and their purchase has been re
quested for the fall101 1913. There seems to be no
reason, if it is the intention of the Indian orfice to
place these Indi as on a self- support ing basis, why it
should not be commenced at once. The northern part of
the reservation, where the Indians are allotted, has
ample pasture for from sixty to teventy- five thousand
head of sheep during the summer months, and the south
addition to the reservation can accommodate
a like num
ber during the winter months. The south addition has
been leased for ver y nearly the aumber mentioned above
during the past two winters; and sufficient water has
been found there for the se sheep. It is therefore fair
to presume that the same number of Indian sheep can be
grazed and pastured thre. A like condition exists on
the northern part of the reservation, on the allotments.
If it is profitable
for lexicans
and other sheep men to
koop their sheep on the reservation and pay stated amounts
per head for Same, it would certainly be more profitable
for the Indians who would not have to pay for the privi
lege. There are a great many Indians who hate herded
seep and helped in lambing time, and are capable of
attena ing to whatever sheep could be purchased at this
time; and they need the employment. It would therefore
so em wise to delay the commencement of the time when
the se Indians are put on a solr- support ing basis.
