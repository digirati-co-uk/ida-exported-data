At the beginning of the preseason of two- a- days,
Coach Patrice and Coach Seatha Chavez were
refreshed with the excellent turnout of athletes. Not
only did the team receive high percentage of
returning players, they were also fortunate to have
many new students and transfer students. The
intensity and motivation was high for all athletes for
the upcoming season.

The leadership roles were assumed by three
returning Seniors.
" In my opinion," said Coach Seatha Chavez," all
three Seniors, Jillian Aguilar, Kristy Gutierrez, and
Shlynn Sanchez exceeded in our expectations. Jillian
Aguilar, who was the speaking captain of the team,
went above and beyond the call of duty."

In addition to the triple threat, the team had a
freshmen surprise early in the season. Christa Valdo
easily worked her way in the starting position and
maintained her position all season. According to the
coaches, she will be someone to look for in the future.
The coaches were also blessed this season with
sophomore sensation Sarah Carlisle; the coaches
believe that Sarah is the best defensive specialist in
the state of New Mexico.
" If she continues to improve in the next two years,
she may end up being the best volleyball athlete we
have ever coached," said Coach Chavez.

Another key player that provided consistency on the
court was Kyleen Chavez.
" Kyleen has been part of the volleyball program
faithfully for the past four years," added Coach
Chavez." Next year she will carry the role of captain,
and we expect her to have her best season ever."
All in all, it was another great season for the Lady
Braves' Volleyball team, and their fans look for next
year to be even better.
