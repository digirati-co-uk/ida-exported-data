STATISTICAL COMPARISONS: One of the ways to determine whether there bas
been an inexase or decrease in the quantity and
quality of Medical Work in the Navajo res is to compare the statistical
totals for two years, separated by a five year interval. This has been
attapted in one of the following tables for the years 1981 and 1935.
the same time the figures tor 1936 have been added to show the ironediate
increase or decrease in comparison with the preceding yoer( Table 1).
In Table 2 there is an analysis of each hospital in terms of rated bed
eapacity, total and per bod allotsent, the number of in- patients availing
themselves of these beds for one year, their average longth of stay and the
cost par patient per hospital day. In the case of 78. Defiance we incorporat
ed the hospital and Sanatorium in one total se there is only one allotmont
covering both.
Tablo 4 gives a breakdown of the Navajo Service Medical Personnel aa
of July, 1936. Or the 228 total Goversent employees 148, or 65%, sro
Indians and 80, or 35%, are whites. Most of the Indians, however, are em
ployed in non- professional capacity. Of the 80 positions oceupied by
physicians and nurses only 10, or 18%, are Indian occupants.
If there be those who think there are too many physicians and nursem
in Navajo Medical Service the following comparisons batween Navajoland and
the general population are offered. It is based on the number of physicians
and nurass on our records and as given on peges 14 and 16 in* An Introduetion
to Publie Health" by Dr. Sustard. I have excluded from the calculation hos
pitals for the feeblaminded, epileptie, maternity, isolation, children's, yo
our, nose and thront, orthopedie, skin& caneex, drug& alcohol, chronie and
incurables, trachoma, venereel and others. I have included only for the
general population of the United States the total number of hospital beds for
