| SoothingRainThe sun rises and a flower bloomsThe light spreads and the flower opens.Soon the sun peaks to middayand the flower flourishes. AThroughout the day and its lifeit fights the wind and enjoys the soothing rains.Still at midday the sun begins its long retreatthe flower begins to wilt.Now it sets and the flower has died bealone it stands ready... waiting for the next dawn togive it life.$.MikeLopezPaula Guiterez smiling.Fermin Lopez glancing.Rae, Chas and KenMelissa Chavez163
