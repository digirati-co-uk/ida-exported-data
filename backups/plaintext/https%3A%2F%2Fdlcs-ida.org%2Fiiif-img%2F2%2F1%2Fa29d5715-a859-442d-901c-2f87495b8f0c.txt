Dear Sirs:
Your letter of the 25th instant is received and contents
noted, and in reply I would inform you, that, by a ruling of the Depart
mont, it is necessary to obtain itemized bids.
Your bid in the aggregate for shingles, flooring and assorted

roquired.
Prices quoted in next lowest bid are as follows.- viz.--

I would also state that dimension lumber is quoted at$ 17,00 per
la and the doors at$ 2.50 each.
Our authority for this expenditure allows only$ 66,25 for the
1., 000 feet of assorted lumber, and even if the above bid was the lowest
it would be impossible to make the purchase at these figures.
