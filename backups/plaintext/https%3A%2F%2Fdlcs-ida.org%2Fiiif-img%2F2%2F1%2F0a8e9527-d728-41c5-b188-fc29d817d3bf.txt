These Indians have resided, made irrigation ditches, and
cultivated the lands they now occupy for centuries and no one dis
puted their rights to both the land, and the water until recently,
now there seems to be a systematic, legal method by which they are
deprived of some of their water rights, and some of their lands.
Fully 90% of the Justice's of the Peace in New Mexico are
Mexican's, a larger per cent of the water overseer's who regulate
and control the water, and who say how much any party shall receive,
and when they can have it are Mexican's; the water overseer's are
elected by the water consumers along the line of the ditches; when
there is an abundant supply of water there is no trouble, when water
is scarce, the Mexican water overseer will give his mexican friends
all the water they wish, and the Indians who have the prior rights
must be content with what water the overseer is willing to give him
no matter how badly his crops need water, if an Indian attempts to
assert his rights, and takes water he knows he is entitled to from
a ditch, he is arrested, taken before a Mexican Justice of the Peace
and is fined; in all cases the decisions are against the Indian.

they are deprived of this large tract of farming land they have
always claimed, cultivated, and supposed was their own, and are obliged
to restrict their farming to the 215 acres of farming land included
in their grant as approved by the U.S. Land Court, there will be a
vast amount of suffering among these people.
Several months ago agent Walpole forwarded maps, and wrote
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs showing fully the condition, and
needs of these particular Indians.
