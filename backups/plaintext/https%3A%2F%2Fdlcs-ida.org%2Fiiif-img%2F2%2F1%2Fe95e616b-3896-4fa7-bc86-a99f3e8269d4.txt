Mozdoo, selling whiskey to Ind lang.casog to date convictions have boon socurod.The Indian police have given aid in the approhensionof boot- leggers, but I do believe that there would be anyadvantago in their having a commission.These Indians make no intoxicating concootions.Ican learn of no cases whoro the Indians buy oxtracts forthe purpose of using it as an intoxicant. Most tradershave liniment for sale, but I Imom of no line of intoxicantsthat has been sold by traders, and there being no offensesit would hardly seem necessary to enact laws of restrictionso far as this jurisdiction at present is concerned.There is always an element which will supply Indianswith whiskey at every opportunity, and with the presence ofsuch men as Thomas E. Brents at frequent intervals to apprehend them, these peddlers will naturally become less bold,and such traffic lessened. It hardly seem possible to stopthe traffic in such towns as Callup,. Mexico.
