EXHIBIT" стA NARRATIVE REPORT ON THE CONDITIONSAS OBSERVED BY MEAMONG THE ZUNI INDIANS AND ABOUT THE AGENCYThe object of this report is, first, to point out a fewof the things which stand in need of improvementor correction;secondly, to suggest or offer remedial measures for their correction.I believe that the Zuni Indians are in dire need of a newhospital and that this should be of a general nature. It should,like a general hospital, be so divided and arranged as to havea ward for tuberculouscases, a ward for contagious and infecti ous cases, and a ward for obstetricalcases. Also, it shouldhave a well isolated ward for clean surgical cases. I stresswards because it has been my experiencethat the Zuni Indiansprefer them, especially the children. This building should bemodern and well equipped with a small laboratory, an X- ray, anoperating room, a diet kitchen, bassinets, dispensary, et cetera.At present we have an old structure which is beyond modernization and which has served its day well. It is designatedasa sanatoriumand operated in conjunctionwith a sanatoriumschool. Sleeping porches have been added on three sides of theoriginal building and the worst of all errors made in their construction is the fact that a heating element was omitted. I hadoccasion to visit these porches during the cold season and foundthem almost unbearablycold. Surely these conditions are notconduciveto health and comfort especiallyto youngsters who arehospitalized. These porches are called wards( male and female)and hold five beds each, making ten beds out of our sixteen bedhospital in the above condition.I have almost two thousand Zunis in my care. Several ofour boys and girls go away to school to continue their education. Most of them return to their homes after school and forvacations so that we can say at least 90% of the Zunis are athome at all times. The present structure cannot by any stretchof the imaginationbe called a sanatorium. It is really an infirmary for children. We haven' t any X- ray equipment, any laboratory, nor any physio- therapy apparatus. The small operatingroom, outside of a few instruments, an$ 18. 00 operating table,and a$ 10. 00 lamp, contains a$ 35. 60 electrical sterilizersuchas is usually found in a country doctor' s office. Dressings,which should be aseptic for surgical purposes, are sterilized ina$ 30. 00 pressure- cooker which is placed on the kitchen s tove.There is no special equipment of any kind for special work. I
