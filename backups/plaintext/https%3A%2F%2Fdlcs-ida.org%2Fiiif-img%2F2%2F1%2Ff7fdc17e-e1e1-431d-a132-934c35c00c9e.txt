the lines described
by the General
Supervisor
of Education
for this district
. Some of our schools
where
the children
are of the proper
age have enrolled
for 4- H club work. We have sewing clubs
for girls, rabbit
clubs
and handicraft
clubs
for boys, and in one or two places
cooking
clubs
have been established

teachers
are going away for summer
school
and for their
annual
leave these

of the teachers

of the school
will take care of the local
population
