Annual ReportCarson School.something unforseen develops the crop should yield over 100 tons.Late frosts and heavy winds in the spring make it difficult to get the more tender vegetables started in the garden,but with patience and care I am satisfied that an abundance ofnearly all kinds of vegetables can be produced at the school.The school garden this year will produce a fair crop of vegetables.The dairy herd is composed of about 20 Holstein cows.The school chickens have produced on an average ofabout 50 dozen eggs per week.There have been many improvements and additions to thebuildings in the past year. The additions to the girls' and boys'dormitories have filled a great need. Sleeping porches are stillto be added to these buildings.A dining room and kitchen is an imperative need of theschool, the places at present used for these purposes being inadequate and unsuitable.A new power house and improvements in the present sewersystem are also imperative needs of the school.other buildings and improvements are required, and itis hoped that as time and funds permit they will be supplied.The school grounds are greatly in need of improvements,but by grading the roads, planting more trees, and some flowersa nd keeping the lawns green and trimmed, the whole appearance willbe changed.The school here has an excellent opportunity for goodwork.- 2
