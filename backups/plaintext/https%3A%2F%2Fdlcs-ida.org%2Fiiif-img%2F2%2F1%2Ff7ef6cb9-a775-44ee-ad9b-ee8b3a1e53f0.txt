tourists who meet an attitude of courteous indifference,

The Indians have but two hundred fifty acres of irrigable
land with hardly sufficient water for crop insurance. The
original ditches used by Tesuque were constructed gener
ations ago, and, before the encroachment of the white
people, carried sufficient water for their cultivatable area.
A submerged daim to check the underflow of the Tesuque
river and diversion for surface flow was constructed to
aiement the water supply but is as yet of doubtful efficiency.
A well was sunk for artesian flor with less success, and
two small reservoirs for recovery of underground flow con
tribute little better in supply. Lining more of the laterals
with cement would correrve the available water and add to
the efficiency of the distributing system.
The mesugue valley gives excellent return from fruit,
and while the Indians will never become practical orchardists
because of the limited farm area and water shortage, well
selected fruit trees rightly located in protected areas would
insure plenty of fruit for community use.
Te sucue, the nearest pueblo to the ancient city of Santa
Fe, perhaps shows less change with the decades than any other
of the pueblo group. With a reported. 119 in 1850 the census

the pueblo and they hold reverently to their pueblo govern
ment, religious ceremonies, and seasonal dances. There is
Some aralcening in the arts and crafts of the pueblo and
improvement and new construction of homes, but unfortunately
their range, fields, and garÄ‘en production is limited by
the scarcity of water for irrigation.
