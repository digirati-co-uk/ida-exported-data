( 30)Indian officials.of course, the larger part of this communalallotment was made generations ago.Such lands are sold and inheritedaccording to Indian custom among the Indians themselves. It is nolonger permitted that these Indians alienate lands or lease tooutsiders without Departmental approval.RETBUR SABLE:On taking charge of the Southern Pueblos Indian Agency,September 1, 1919, Superintendent Crane found outstanding more thanfour teen thousand dollars reimbursable monies.The report madeOctober 31, 1919 showed as unpaid,$ 14,340.47, of which$ 4,000 wasdelinquent. To date of this report( June 1922 about 33 months)$ 8,000 of this indebtedness has been collected, and 276 accountsclosed out. It is true that the delinquency has increased, nearlyall the remaining indebtedness( about$ 6400) being delinquent,Considering the financial condition of the Pueblo Indians, it isbelieved that to have collected 57% of the indebtedness in this timeis worthy of mention;especially when it is known that the largerpart of the monies owing is from Laguna Indians, who seem to havebeen somewhat of the opinion that the" reimbursable plan" wouldeventually result in a gift. Because of this apparent viewpoint,I have recommended since 1919 to advance no additional reimbursablemonies.
