The juniors are upperclassmen, but not quite at the top.
They still have one more year to go, a year full of college
applications and assessment tests that they must endure
before college or the beginnings of their careers. Their jun
ior year was the year that they had to get everything ready
for the beginning of life as college students or members of
the working world. Soon, however, they would celebrate
the graduation of Santa Fe Indian School' s Class of 2002.
