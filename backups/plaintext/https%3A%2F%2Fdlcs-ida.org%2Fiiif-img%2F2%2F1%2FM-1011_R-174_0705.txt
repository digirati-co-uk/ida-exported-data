ANNUAL REPORT, 1925- ZUNI AGENCY, N. M.
POPULAT I QN.
The Councils of the Zuni Tribe are much the same as in
other Pueblos.
The personnell of these councils is generally
made up of older members of the tribe. While some of the se m.
members have rather a high degree of intelligence, others do not
average up very well. The whole fabric of the tribe is bound
up in this foom of Government. I sometimes think it would be
just as well to ignore them to a great extent. It would no
doubt be better to recognize them and delegate to them the
settling of many minor matters among themselves, and at the
same time do what we can to lead them into liberal progress
as time goes on.
