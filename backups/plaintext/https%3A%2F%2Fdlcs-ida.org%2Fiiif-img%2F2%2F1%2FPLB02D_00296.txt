The SanIldefonso Indianlan Is east ofthe Rio Grande river, as well as someof the non- Indian landsin the vicinity of San Ildefonso, could also, we are informed,be so irrigated by an extension of the ditches from thisproject into that region. A surveywould be necessary todemonstrate this.There is no evidence that at thetime the district was es.tablished, the United States or the Indian Office was consultedas to the inclusion within the District of that part of theSanta Clara Pueblo Grant lying cast of the river.
