Santa Fe, N.M., July 28, 1924.-12.to the plan at that time by the representativesof thestate, providing the mineral rights might, at the optionof the holders of the inside land, be reta ined.After that I made various trips to the Crown Pointcountry, to Gallup and elsewhere, to round up the matter,and secured the assent of practically everyone concerned,with the exception of the Arizona- New Mexico Land Company,which holds two or three townships of alternate sectionswithin the proposed area, There was some oppositionla ter developed in Gellup, and slight opposition in SanJuan county. But on the whole, this opposition was notvery material and could have been easily overcome.However, later, certain stockmen, who held some rangesin Rio Arriba county and were in the habit of using thewinter range in part of the proposed area, expressedopposition to the proposed plan, as also did, to at certa in extent, Governor Hinkle of New Mexico. The governorhas no sympathy for the Indians and but little understanding of the Indian question, and while he would notcome out in open opposition to the extension, neveracquiesced in it.I later went to Washington and a bill was drawnup with the approval of the Commissioner, and with therecornendation of the Secretary was introduced into theHouse of Representatives. It did not, however, elicitany interest on the part of Congress and failed of pagsage. This was a very great disappointment to theIndians in the Crown Point district as well as to the.stockmen own ing lands in that vicinity, all of whomwere anxious for the consumma tion of the plan. Theyare still anxious that it be brought up for cons ideration at the next Congress, and perhaps the work thathas been done and the record which has been made maybe helpful in securing its consideration at the nextsession. I hope very much that the Indian Office willbear this in mind when Congress reconvenes, as none ofthe parties interested are any less desirous than theywere of securing this extension, and many of the Indiansare pretty bitter about the situation. It was veryunfortunate indeed, in my opinion, that allotmen ts wereever made to the Indians in this general area,has produced a situation which is increasingly difficult to adjust as time goes on.
