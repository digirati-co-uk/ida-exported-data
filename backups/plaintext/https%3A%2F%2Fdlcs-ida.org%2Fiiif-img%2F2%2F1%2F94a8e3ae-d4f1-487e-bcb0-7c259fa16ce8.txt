My dear Mr. Commssioner:
I have the honor to forward herewith narrative section
of the annual report of Supt. E. F. Coggeshall for the fiscal
year, 1917. Delay has been caused by the severe 1llness of
Mr. Coggeshall, a shortage of office help, and an extra
ordinary amount of work incident to a change of superin
tendents.
Very truly yours,
Charles we stigham
clerk in Charge.
