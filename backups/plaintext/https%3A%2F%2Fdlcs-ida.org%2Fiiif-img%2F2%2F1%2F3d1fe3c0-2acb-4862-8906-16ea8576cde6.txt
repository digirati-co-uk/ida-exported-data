Tricks Of The Trade
Do you remember trading
something with someone else that
you knew was well worth the
swap?

Have you ever traded
something with someone
else that you knew was well
worth the swap? Sometimes
you can get a great deal on
E something you need and
sometimes not. Let us go
far back into your childhood
years or even this past year
and look at all the times that
you' ve exchanged something with someone else. How many
times have you ever loaned out a pencil to a friend or
neighbor in class that has needed it?
How many times has
someone owed you a favor
in return? Trading things in
life is as simple as saying
hello to a by- passing
person in the hallways.
Other times trading
something can be hard,
because the item may be
very special to you or you
may need it. The catch is that trading whatever you like is
always an act of goodness. Just look at it as kind of like
karma. You do something good for someone else and in the
end it' ll turn back to you, regardless of whoever it is you
decide to trade with. So, the next time you know you' re going
to be trading something, think about what good it does for
someone else.
