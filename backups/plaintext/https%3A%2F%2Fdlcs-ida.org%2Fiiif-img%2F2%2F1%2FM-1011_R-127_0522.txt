Annual Report,Law& Order- 9.Santa Fe Schooland Agency.actually on duty in the field. My plan would be for suchan officer to be constantly on the move about and amongthe pueblos, and I believe his efforts would be successfulin an appreciable decrease in the drunkeness and disorderamong the pueblosKnowing the indifference of the state officialstoward the enforcement of the law in the pueblo communities,and with an intimate knowledge of factional differences,promoted by a considerableincrease in drunkeness among theIndians in the several pueblos, I would respectfully urgeearly and favorable considerationof this recommendationwhich would provide temporarily, at least, pending thedecision in the appeal of the Sandoval case, needed policesupervision in the pueblo c ommunities,During the past yOrr, three Santo Domingo Indianawore indicted, and two were convicted and sent to the StatePenitentiary for a term of fourteen months each for larcencyin the theft of turquoise matrix from the Tiffany Company' smines at CerrilloB, An investigation of the facts of thecharges against the Indians subsequent to their arrest convinced me of the strong probability of the ir guilt, andafter consideration of the facts, both Mr. Wilson and I feltwe would not b warranted in providing a defense for theseIndians,Both the Santo Domingo and Cochiti Indians havebeen warned repeatedly in years past to keep away from theturquoise mines, In the past Indians from both of thesepueblos have been convicted and sentenced to the penitent.Iary for thefts of turquoise from these mines. They thor.oughly understand the penalty attached to conviction forthe 1st of turquoisand had no business which would takethem to this vicinity, excopt motives of theft. The Ind.ians had no defense except Cortain testimony, which seemedneither reasonable nor plausible. Under the circumstancesit se ened a poor policy for Indian olice officials to provide a defense, and so attempt to defeat laws of the stateprovided for the protection of property interests., Thetestimony brought out on the witness stand confirmed ourprior judgement, and fully justified and sustained ourposition in this matter.
