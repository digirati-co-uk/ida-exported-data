Thebuildings, most of them, are constructed of red sandstoneand are in a good state of repair.More buildings are badly needed, both agengy andschools. The Agency is in need of buildings as follows:A cottage for the use of the agency physician.The Government has never furnished a building for the housing of himself and his family. Thus far quarters have beenrented for this purpose. Nothing better being available,crude ad obe quarters have been rented. They are not suchas to make living in them even comfortable.Also a small building should be furnished by theGovernment for use professionally as a dispensary and consultation quarters. At present a small room in the quartersrented for the use of the family of the physician is usedfor this purpose. This exposes his family to the risk ofcontracting disease from the Indians and does not provideprivacy for his family.A small building is also needed for use of thephysician in which to house his team and rig, feed for theteam and storage of supplies. We have none at present.
