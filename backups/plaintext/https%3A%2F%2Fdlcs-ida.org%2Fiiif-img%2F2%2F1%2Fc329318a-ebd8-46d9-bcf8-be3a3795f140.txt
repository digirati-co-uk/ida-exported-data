This is the one page of the annuelstatistical report which should be accurate because it involvesfinancial considerations. Last year we had to send out an entirelynew questionnaire concerning this woric in order to get anywherenear reliable data and this year the material is coming in as pooras ever. You are expected to go over this sheet carefully to makecorrections for appropriations and for use to which the money isspent, whether for agency, hospital( Government or non- Governmentor school.You show no expenditures for the hospital. The cost shouldnot be entirely placed on the school column, but should be appropriated between that and the Goverwent hospital. You list nomedical expenditures for the hospital. Please give this matter yourcareful and immediate attention and submit it at your earliestconvenience.Very truly yours,( Signed) CF. Hauke7 RM 17Chief Clerk.
