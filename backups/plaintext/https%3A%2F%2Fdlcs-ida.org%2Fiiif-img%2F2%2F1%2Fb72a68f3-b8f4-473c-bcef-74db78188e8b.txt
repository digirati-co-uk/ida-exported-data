3Yover the public domain, and more particularly against those whograze their flocksoutside of their reservation, and there is danger of serious trouble arising from it in the near future unlesssomething is done to remedy the matter complained of.After having seen considerable of the Navajo reservation andcountry bordering upon it on the west and south, and also havingmet and conversed with a considerable number of the white men ofthat section, I am of the opinion that an extension of the Reservation boundary would be advisable.The present Navajo reservation,including the moqui reservation which is largely appropriated bythe Navajos for grazing purposes, while being extensive in area isbarren and worthless in many portions, and does not afford sufficient pasturage for their flocks, and I therefore concur in therecommendation of Major Constant Williams, Acting Indian Agent, inhis letter to the Department dated May 7th, 1898, regarding extension of boundary lines.Should the lines recommended by MajorWilliams be considered as embracing more land than would be deemedconsistent with public policy, I would then recommend that the linebe extended to the Little Colorado River as suggested by John S.Mayhugh, Special Allotment Agent, in conclusion of his report dated January 21st, 1894.The Little Colorado River is considerableof a stream and would give a natural boundary between the Indiansand whites, and there are very few white settlers, other than thefew Mormons at Tuba City, now locatedwithin the tract thatwould thus be added to the Indian reservation.
