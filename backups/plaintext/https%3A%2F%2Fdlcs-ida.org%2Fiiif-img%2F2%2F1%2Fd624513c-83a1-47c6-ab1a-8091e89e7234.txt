It is believed that the National Prohibition Act has possibly
increased the illegal traffio in 11 quors in Albu querque and other cities
near the Pueblos and ono result has been to make the procurement of
liggor easier for the Indians. In that respect the liquor problem has
possibly been somewhat complioatod.
There is no complaint regarding the use of drugs among the
Pueblo Indians and no manufacture of liquors among the Pueblos so far as
I am aware.
The practice of gambling is believed to be quite common among the
Pueblo Indians who generally use games which originated among their
ancestors. However gaming is not of sufficient importance to interfere
particularly with their industrial pursuits. Hence, unless cases
unusually flagrant are reported no attention is made to check the
practice of gambling.
No important decisions have been rendered during the fiscal year
ei ther by the State or Federal Courts affecting the Indians of this
jurisdiction. Certain matters of legislation are pending before
Congress which effect the land titles of the Pueblos and these are of
the utmost importance to the Indians of New Mexico.
