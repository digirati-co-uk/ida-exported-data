Pueblo Bonito School
Annual Report 1919
Schools.
At present the school farm consists of 35 acres
in cultivation, with water enough for twenty acres during
the dry years. The water used for irrigation of this land
is from the reservoir which is supplied from two artesian
wells, and I consider it would be a good investment to drill
at least two more wells and construot another reservoir, and
forty to sixty acres put into cultivation, as hay alone costs
the Government every year thirty to fifty dollars per ton and
with thirty acres of alfalfa with three cuttings a year, there
would be no necessity for buying hay after this crop could be
started. At this time we only have twelve and one- half acres
of alfalfa, but if we soon have rein we expect to plant ten
acres more.
Employees, with several exceptions, have worked in
ha rmony with each other and the Superintendent, and for the
interest and advancement of the individual pupil.
A moving picture machine has been purchased and
through visual instruction we expect that this feature of
educational, industrial and news films will be a point of
attraction for the pupil, with beneficial results to them.
No playground apparatus as yet has been furnished, but we are
hopeful that the office will take favorable action on the
purchase of certain equipment, before the close of this year.
