Mt. Pleasant SchoolMichiganANNUAL REPORTNARRATIVE SECTIONSection II--------- HealthThe general health conditions at this school was well asthose among the Indians on the outside, for the last fiscalyear, were very good. The school had some mila cases of mumpsand a few cases of chicken pox. These were of a very mildcharacter and very little time was lost by the pupils from theirschool work.The medical work necessary among the local Indians isdone by the county if the Indians are not able to pay for theirown medical treatment. An Indian need not go without medicalservices if he is in need of it as the county authorities arevery kind in this matter. There is no record available ofvenereal diseases but from information gathered from the localhealth authorities this is not a problem.This school has within the last year remodeled its hospitaland now has a splendid building for the care of its patients.It is a 31 bed hospital, light airy, and comfortable, as wellas convenient. Fortunately this building was not needed verymuch during the last school year. However should there be aserious epidemic at any time the school can very easily takecare of its patients. The hospital is so arranged that patientswith different ailments can be separated. It is possible tohave contagious cases entirely separated from other cases. Thehospital is not equipped as it should be and far more equipmentis needed. than we now have on hand to properly carry on thework necessary. One fine thing in the state of Michigan isthat children who are not able to pay their own hospital billsmay be sent to the University Hospital at Ann Arbor and receivetreatment without cost. Serious operative cases may be sentthere. The employees who are carrying on the medical workare sufficient in number.
