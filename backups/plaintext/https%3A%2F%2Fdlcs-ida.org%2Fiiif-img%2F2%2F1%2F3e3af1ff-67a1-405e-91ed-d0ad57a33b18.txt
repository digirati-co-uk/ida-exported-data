Lar and Order.
The present agenoy buildings in Albuquerque are inadequate.
The office is looated in a large residence which also provides
quarters for the Superintendent and his family on the second floor.
It then becomes necessary to rent quarters for the chief clerk,
property clerk, financial olerk, stenographer, physician, and the
agency mechanic who is located in Albuquerque.
The present federal building in Albuquerque is now over
crowded and many government offices are renting space in local
office buildings. Some of those renting are:
Federal Prohibition Office- Old Herald Building
United States Biological Survey- 3133 W. Central
United States Bureau of Plant Industry- Korber Bldg.,
United States Immigrant Inspector- First National Bk.Bldg.
United States Internal Revenue Collector- Korber Bldg.
Indian Irrigation Office- Korber Building,
Veterans Bureau â€¢ Korber Building
Bureau of Animal Industry- City Hall
District Forester- Gas& Electric Building.
The matter of economizing on rentals is up for consideration
and will be considered further during the fiscal year 1926. A large
Federal Building is needed in Albuquerque.
The present force of agency employees is sufficient for the
needs of the office.
There is very little disorder among the Indians. The Indian
police are quite able to care for practically all situations that
arise and it is not believed that additional legislation is needed
at this time.
