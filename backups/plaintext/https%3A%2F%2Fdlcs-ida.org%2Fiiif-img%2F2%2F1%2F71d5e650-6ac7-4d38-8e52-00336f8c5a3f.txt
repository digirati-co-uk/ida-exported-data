NARRATIVE1920Section VIS a I esJicarilla AgencyNew MexicoNo patents in fee nor certificates of competencyhave been issued to any member of the Jicarilla tribe.This should not be taken as evidence that there areno merabers that are entitled to such considerationfor a number of them have herds of cattle, sheep andgoats and are able to make theown way in the world.When the allotments were made the timber was heldin reserve as tribal during the life of the trustpatents and for a period of twentyfive years on allresidue.A portion of the reservation is yet unsurveyed and this fact with the regulation governingthe timber rather precludes any sales for a period ofyears.It should be remembered that the entire reservation is one large grazing proposition and allotmentsshould not at any time be sold to others than Indiansand to none other than Jicarillas except that suchpurchaser be formally accepted by the tribe.A number of heirship cases have been determinedbut a very large number of undetermined estates arenow open and funds to their credit have reached atotal of several thousand dollars which is heldpending hearings and settlements of the estates,â€¢ 25-
