NARRATIVE13CONTINUEDSection 4.IndustriesAnnual Report1914JicarillaAgencyNew Mexico.In general, it can be said that the Indians have helatheir own for the fiscal year 1914.On July 1st, 1912, theirindebtedness was$ 18,000.This was decreased in July 1,1913, to$ 12,000- partly due to a payment of$ 5,100 madethem in February of that year.On July 1, 1914, theirindebtedness was$ 14,193, the increase being on accountof tie cutters who have not received pay for ties cut lastspring. A very wet spring and summer prevented them gettingtheir ties to the railroad track for inspection. The tieswhen delivered will net the Indians about$ 2,400, whichamount, when paid, will leave their indebtedness slightlyless than the former year.Three pastures for horse breeding purposes were builtand the Indians brought their mares willingly for service, andit is proposed to purchase more horses for the next breedingseason and to induce the Indians to get rid of the ponystallions from the range.I think for the good of the tribeand the range that Indians should be hired to round- up allstallions of small size, as the individual owners will notexert themselves to do so and many are owned by old men andwomen who could not do so if they could.
