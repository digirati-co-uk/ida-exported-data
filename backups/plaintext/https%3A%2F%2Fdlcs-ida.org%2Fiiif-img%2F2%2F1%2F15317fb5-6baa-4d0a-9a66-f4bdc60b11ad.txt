He a ith
Jicarilla
Agency
New Mexico
The very high percentage
of aged people among
the remnant of the Jicarilla Apache tribe vouch for
their strength and vigor before civilization
gave
them hygienic problems
entirely foreign to their
pristine
experience
.
A century ago the Jicarilla
was strictly an outdoor character, migrating with
the seasons with little need for shelter or protection
from the elements
,
In this life they escaped tuber
culosis
and other insidious
ailments
but they gave
heavy toll to the more spectacular
plagues of war,
starvation
, and smallpox
.
Domiciled
on their present reservation
in 1887
with limited hunting grounds
amid vice and dissipation
common
to ratilroad
construction
camps, facing the
capricious
winters of high altitudes
, tribal equilibrium
was soon upset. Dissipation
, idleness
, privation
, and
disease
followed
in
turn, Tuberculosis
primarily
a
house disease
found maximum diffusion
in their poorly
constructed
houses and dugouts and tribal diminution
has been appalling
. Adjustments
are necessary
but
at their worst today, there is improvement
over their past.
