My dear Mr. Commissioner;
Section IV Industries
The industrial work at the Santa Fe School during
the past year was reasonably satisfactory with the exception of
the work in the carpentry department. Having no regular carpenter
it was necessary to employ temporarily and it was not possible to
find any one who was qualified to give very efficient service
Because of such inefficiency it was necessary to reroof one of the
cottages three times before we had a roof that did not leak.
The instruction given in the industrial departments was
not what it should have been. The principal supervised this instru
ction, but not many of the men in the shops are instnuctors and a
shop instructor should be provided
The farm teams and trucks have done all the hauling for
the school in addition to an immense amount of hauling of materials
for the new dormitory, including sand and gravel.
The following is a list of farm and garden products for
the year:
Milk 59200 lbs. 06Â¢$ 3552. 00
Roasting cars 650 doz 97. 50
Vegetables 118575 lbs. 3580. 75
Ensilage corn 140 tons at$ 10 1400. 00
Pigs 60 600. 00
Calves 1580 45. 00
Total$ 9275. 25
