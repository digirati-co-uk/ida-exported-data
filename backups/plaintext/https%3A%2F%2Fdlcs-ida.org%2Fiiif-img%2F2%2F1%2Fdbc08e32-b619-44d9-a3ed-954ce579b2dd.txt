Section IX--- Salos
Most of the information required does not apply to Boarding
Schools. We handle a small amount of Indian moneys which represent
the earnings of pupils. An effort 18 made to have one half of the
earnings saved and given to the pupils when they leave school.
small payments are made to pupils having funds.
