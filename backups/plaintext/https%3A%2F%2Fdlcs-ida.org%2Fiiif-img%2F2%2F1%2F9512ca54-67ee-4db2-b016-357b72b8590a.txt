There have been meny vacancies in the employee force, and this has
made the work hard and sometimes annoying. The positions of Teacher, of
Agriculture, and Farmer were author ized at the beginning of the year, but
a permanent appointment for Teacher of Agriculture was not made until
later in the year, and a nu nber of substitutes were employed. The
position of Farmer has not yet beed filled, and temporary appointments
have been made to this position from time to time. The school was, also
without a disciplinarian for the greater part of the year.
In the past, a great many primary pupils have been enrolled from the
Najavo camps and pueblos, but in the future, none below the four th grade
will be accepted, however, those now enrolled will be permitted to cor
tinue in attendance even though they are below the fourth grade. The
present enrollment for this year will be in grades as follows:
Second grade..
Third
Fourth"..
Fifth
Sixth
Seventh".

Seven of our graduates were in attendance at the city High school during

of the graduates, Finnie Lynch, has been employed as stenographer and
typewriter
by the Occidental Life Insurance Company in Albuqu er que.
The other gradva te, Bell Begay, has taken the teacher' s examination and
expects to teach in the public schools.
