Indian Industrial sahool,Santa Fe, Jow Mexico,Angust 2nd, 1913.Mrs. Alice G. Dwire,TaO8, New Mexioo.Dear Madam:In reply to your lutter of August12th in te tereno e to the Soho01 boys who workedat Rocky Fora desiring to have their money, Iwould say that the boys earned as follows:Severino Archuleta$ 26. 95Onesimo Archuleta" 31. 65Ben Kirabal26. 25Santano Martinez28. 45Before leaving, for their homes, I advanced eachof the Bo BoyB 88200 apie00. A Te0eat oironlarfrom the Indian Ortise states that no moneys received for pupils shall be paid to them withoutprevious authority from the Indian office. However, as this is very unexpected and unknown tothe pupils, I enclose herewith a ohook of$ 20. 00drawn to your order, out of which I would like tohave you give each Boy$ 5. 00. As you will see,they will then have dram nearly one- half of theirearnings for the summer.It is oustomary at most boardingBohools of this character to set aside at leastone- half of the boy' s earnings, to be given tohim in case of some special need or at the timehe leaves school. I wish you would try to impressupon these boys that they should not draw all oftheir money at once, and spend it without havinganything to show for it. When they return toschool, they will want to buy certain things,and I wish if possible to keep their balanceshere for them.Very respectfully,PS( C)Asst. Superintendent.
