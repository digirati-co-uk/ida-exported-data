Annual Report- 5Santa Fe Schoolbrings the conclusion that the contrary is trueIn contemplation of such an important step as governmenttrusteeship of the Pueblo lands, there are many phases whichpresent themselves for care ful consideration, in the apparentdeparture from the fundamental policy of the Office in preparingthe Indian for the lifting of the government hand by allotmentin severaltyIf in pending or future litigation the courts should declare the provisions of the Enabling Act of New Mexico, affect.ing the Pueblo Indians and their lands, unconstitutional, anddeclare correlatively unconstitutional the Act of Congress exempting the Pueblo lands from taxation, and should- as wouldfollow such decision- the lands of the Pueblos, or even the irsurplus lands, become taxable, a decade would see the Pueblosstripped of their only material asset- their lands.In this connection, it must be understood that at presentthe Indians eke out a scanty existence and raise barely enoughcrops for their own subs is tence, with no surplus product formarket.
