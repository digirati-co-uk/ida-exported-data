sufficient justification exists to assign a regular teacher
to this necessary work.
Attached to this statement are the annual reports
of work done by each teacher during the year 1933-34. We
realize that the work done has many imperfections. However
the teaching staff is trying to break away from the errors
of the past, avoid mistakes of the present, and develop a
sound educational program which will train our pupils to
be thinkers and doers in trying to solve the difficult and
serious problems facing the Navajo tribe.
