In 1900 this agency was abolished and responsibilityfor the Pueblo Indianswas divided between the superintendentsof the Sante Fe and Albuquerque Indian schools, in northern andsouthern New Mexico, respectively. Except for a brief periodduring 1911- 12, this administrative organization remained ineffect until 1914.
