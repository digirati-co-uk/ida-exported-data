We should have aphysician who wants to do ali he can for these peoplewith the equipment he has. Our hospital is a fine onoand we have an excellently superior force in it exceptingthe physician. I am greatly dissatisfied at the smallresults gotten with this investment and know that wecould do a great deal more if we had a right kind ofphysician here. There is a splendid opportunity to togreat work and the hospital should be full at alltimes, with the end in view of covering the full fieldand handling all kinds of cases. It appears to me that with5,000 Indians we would have little trouble in keeping thehospital 100 per cent. efficient at all times if we couldget a physician in charge that would be both capableand industrious enough to get in the patients and handlethen properly after he got them. The Indians, so far asI can see, are interested in and friendly to this work.They certainly need medical attention,4. Venereal Disease is not so bad here as one would think,but there is no concertod effort or systematic plan tocontrol it. We do what we can in the field and help thelocal conditions a great deal, but do not make positiveexaminations only in suspected cases.a. There is no records and therefore no way of even approximately stating number of cases on this reserve.b. We treat every case we run across or that is reported.6. Our medical force has perfected no plans for an aggrossive campaign against this disease. It is too sma uto do this.“ า ก:NoteWWEЯ5. I am sorry to say that we have ben without a physiciana considerable part of this past fiscal year and alsohave had a young physician here since January first whohas been able to do very little toward improving ourinterest and medical conditions. He is not fitted at allfor such an important place; he is too young and inexperienced and considers too lightly the wonderful chanceshere to do a great work. We have the hospital and equipment.le prevents its use in behalf these Indians. Our today'sHospital Report shows we carry two patients in our 30- bedhospital. Is there anything more to be said? There is atleast 40 per cent Trachoma among these Indians and ifnothing else was done the hos pital should be filled at alltime with these patients and they held then till cured.Our physicians here and at Oraibi do a great deal ofwork in the field and make tripes several times each weekto the Day Schools, Villages, etc., and do a great deal ofwork among Indian homes. This should not be overlookedin considering what we have done, for it is important toget to cases where they can not get to us.Dengan semeone threr han
