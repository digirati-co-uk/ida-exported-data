Section 6, Field: Irrigation
.
No water filings
have been made, to my knowledge
, for
irrigation
purposes, the water being mostly secured from
reservoirs
constructed
by the Government
on Indian allotments
or tribal lands, and the title held by appropriation
and
usage.
Section
7- Allotments
The allotting
of the Jibarilla
Apache Indians was
commenced
August 1907 and completed
in August 1909. Very
few errors have been discovered
, but there are a few which
should be remedied
. About 12 Indians have been given agri
cultural
allotments
, varying in size from 2 to 10 acres,
on patented land. These must be changed. There are also
three Indians, from 14 to 16 years old, who were overlook
ed, or more likely hid out to escape school, who have no
allotments
, agricultural
or grazing, that should be allott
ed.
None of the surplus lands were opened for settlement
,
but several
settlers are scattered
among the Allotments
,
who had claims patented
or patents pending at the time of
allotting
. Very little surplus land remains, and is of
little value.
Section
8- Contracts
.
No business councils
are held by the tribe: they de
pend chiefly on the advice of the officer in charge or
their elected
chief, are easily convinced
and willing to
follow good advice,
They have no tribal funds or annuities
of any kind,
and depend entirely upon their individual
efforts to ob
tain the necessit√©es
of life, with the exception
of the
older people and children
, who are partially
supported
by rations given them semi- monthly by the Government
.
No patents in fee have been issued for any of their
lands, no sales of inherited
lands made, no estates pro
pated, and therenare
no Individual
Indian Bank accounts
to supervise
.
