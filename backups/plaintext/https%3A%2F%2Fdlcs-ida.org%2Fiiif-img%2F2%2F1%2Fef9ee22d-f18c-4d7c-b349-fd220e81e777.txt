The Girls need actual experience in Housekeeping.
I believe suffic
ient drill in meeting daily problems in the Hogan Home Economics De
partment will emphasize these points sufficiently to make valuable
life habits.
Of course, I do believe that every boy and girl should have sufficient
industrial experience in all of these things suggested above, but per
haps not to such a thorough degree as the part particularly suggested
for them.
The present curriculum lacks greatly in subject matter for Geography,
History, Civics, Arithmetic and perhaps-- Culture. Much of this could
be local subject matter but they need a better background in other
subject matter, too, if they are to be educated to compete with those
outside of the reservation.
