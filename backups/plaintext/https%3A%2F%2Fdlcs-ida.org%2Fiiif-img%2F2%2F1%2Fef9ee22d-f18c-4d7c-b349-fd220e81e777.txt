The Girls need actual experience in Housekeeping.I believe sufficient drill in meeting daily problems in the Hogan Home Economics Department will emphasize these points sufficiently to make valuablelife habits.Of course, I do believe that every boy and girl should have sufficientindustrial experience in all of these things suggested above, but perhaps not to such a thorough degree as the part particularly suggestedfor them.The present curriculum lacks greatly in subject matter for Geography,History, Civics, Arithmetic and perhaps-- Culture. Much of this couldbe local subject matter but they need a better background in othersubject matter, too, if they are to be educated to compete with thoseoutside of the reservation.
