Clique
By; Christian Becenti
You can go to any other public school and see that there
is a difference between what they have and what we
don' t. I' m not talking about ethnicity. I' m talking about the
other side of what todays trends are all about. Cliques! “ Our School doesn' t
I know some of you guys out there from time to time
feel that you have to belong to groups just to be known nave na
n have Cliques. Just
or have some kind of existence( believe me I' ve been normal People ”
there). It scares one to see how far you' ll go just to get Scott Martinez
a reputation.
So when we compare ourselves to
other public schools around the state
we begin to see this huge difference.
Sure our school has groups of friends,
and you see them all the time. The only
thing that these friends don' t set for
themselves is boundries, and having
limits is what makes a true clique. I' m
talking about making rules for each
other, such as not wearing blue on
your best friend' s boy/ girl friend.
Thursday or dating
Whatever these rules are, they exist in
other schools. But not here- not at SFIS.
This is what makes the Santa Fe Indian
School so peculiar and different from
other schools. Not that it' s a bad thing,
but I' m sure high school would be at its
best and a little bit more exciting.
Cliques would clash and where you sit in
the cafeteria would be crucial. So lets
just pray that fifty years from now, SFIS
will still be the same laid back school it" I think the guys mostly
is today.
have Cliques."
