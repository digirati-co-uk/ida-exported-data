NARRATIVE.Industries( Cont' a)I have a very nice start on a tribal herd for the purpose of raisinga better grade' of rams for the Indians. The authority given mehas made it difficult to get the number. The price of sheep has goneso high. But I have 500 now and shall get 500 more ewes in thenext three months. What I have are worth several thousand dollarsmore than I paid for them and they are doing well. Conditions thisspring have been very bad on the range and I have had to feed somehay. but now the rains have begun and if they do not play out weshould have range feed enough.REMARKS.The whole situation here is bad on account of the uncertain statusof the Indians with regard to their lands. So far as I know theyhave not any title to the Castle Butte District and it is there thatmost of them live.Allotment selections made nine years ago have not been patented tothem. And if they are and this land is the limit of the Indiansrights they will nor have enough to live on.Development along the lines of stock raising, agriculture or anyindustries where tenure of land is concerned must necessarily bedependent upon the action taken to secure these Indians their homes.The Indians have no title at al 1 to water on railroad lands, stateschool lands, or public domain, and development cannot be do ne wherethey have no title.It is hoped that their land matters will be handled to their bestinterest in the near future. Until this is done all is uncertainty.Respectfully submitted,Stephen Janus,Superi rit endent.
