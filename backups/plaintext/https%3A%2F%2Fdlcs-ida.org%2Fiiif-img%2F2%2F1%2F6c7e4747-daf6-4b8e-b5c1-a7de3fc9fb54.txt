Santa Indian School,Santa Fe, 1. Modon,Doombor 1, 1916.Mr. C. A. Podorson,loomita, 1. Midoo.Der Bir:In reply to your letter of November 28, 1916, I woulday that Joe Pocanto and Jou Loon ran away from this cohoolover a week age, but they were apprehonded by people of theAlbuquerque Indian School and I expect that they will be backhere in a day or two. So far as I know, these boys have noreason whatever for running awey and I regret very much thatthey have taken this course as they seemed to have been verysatisfactory pupils until this occured.Very sincerely yours,Superintendent.
