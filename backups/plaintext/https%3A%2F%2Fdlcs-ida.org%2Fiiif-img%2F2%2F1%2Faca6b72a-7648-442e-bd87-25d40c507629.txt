Amual Report

San Juan School& Agency
Thus far I have met with full cooperation on the part of
the state authorities in the efforts made for the suppression
of the liquor traffic on this reservation.
I believe it would be advisable to have Deputy Special
Officers' comissions issued to agency farmers.
It is frequently
necessary for them to visit points outside the reservation and
such commissions would be for their protection and an aid to
thera in obtaining evidence and making arrests in connection with
any case of furnishing liquor to Indians which might come under
their observation.
The Indians of this jurisdiction do not make intoxicating
drinks such as tulapai or tiswin.
The use of peyote or mescal is unknown among the Indians
on this reservation.
None of the traders on this reservation handle intoxi
cants or patent medicines which contain a large percentage
of alcohol. A limited amount of extracts for flavoring and
cooldng are carried by the traders, but these extracts are not
sold to the Indians.
A sufficiently close supervision is main
tained to prevent traffic of this sort.
The enactment of state prohibition in Colorado has w
doubtedly aided in eliminating liquor on this reservation and
in preventing druzenness among the Navajoes who visit the
toms in that state, contiguous to the reservation. Local
