Most of our seed is saved from our owncrops. However, we have had to purchaseSome seed this year. I am rna king an experiment this year with the Aztec bean, of whichI secured about fifty kernels at the TubaIndian School last fall.The plants are coming along in good shape and I hope to secureenough seed to enable us to plant a goodlyareanext spring. Also, last winter I foundat the Leupp Indian School a variety ofcorn which appealed to me very strongly.I brought an ear along and planted it inour garden. It gives promise of being athrifty plant and one which will yield well.We haven small green- house about 20square. This should be enlarged considerably. We us eds this place during the pastwinter and spring for starting our vegetableplants and for the protection of floweringplants.The cabbage, tomato, and otherplants started therein were, of course, transferred tothe gardens as soon as the weatherpermitted.On July first of this year we changedOur mode of water purchase from a flat rate of$ 1600. per year to a meter basisOf courseI cannot tell at present whetheror not theamountof$ 1600. allotted by Congressisgoing to be sufficientto enable us to keepup our usual gardeing activities.
