LifeSky illuminatedflames flickeringhigh.Smoke covering,encircling the air.Terror, panic starta stampede,galloping for Life.Hooves tearing, newlyscorched earth.Eyes white and rolling.Running to the oceanstraight ahead, beyondyellow, orange, red,flames of Death.Pushing shoving tofreedom.Standing on theother side, tired, breathless,looking out to their oncegreen home, now black,and dead.If only it were a dream.Piano students get their homework assignment.Top: ALP students at Native American Opportunity Conference in Socorro.Above: Kathy, Audrey, Kelley and Regis wait forpiano lessons.ALP reception for Honor students was well attended.Serious David listens carefully.92
