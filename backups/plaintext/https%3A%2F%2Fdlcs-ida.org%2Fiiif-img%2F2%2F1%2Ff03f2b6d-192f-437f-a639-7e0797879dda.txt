remain
in the employ
of the present
Superintendent
for another
year, their
position
under
the present
management
would
be render
ed extremely
uncomfortable
, to say the least, for this man and
this
woman, have reduced
to a fine art the science
of petty,
malicious
persecution
, whicla
would
be unscrupulously
applied
to
them
.
Therefore
, and for these two reasons
, and more egebially
the latter
one, I leave
the matter
where
it now stands
, tristne
,
and firmly
believing
, that eventually
the truth will be brought
to light, and that these people
will reap just auch harvest
as
they have sowed, and that all who have* 119 unjustly
suffered
at their hands will be vindicated
, and further, and mainly, that
the good intentions
of the v. S. Gov't in the behalf of the
Indian children
will be fully carried out at the Santa Fe School,
Respectfully
,
