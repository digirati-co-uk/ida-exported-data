School
Groves made a survey of the pueblo of Santo Domingo,( the most backward
in the state) and found these improved conditions obtai ned in homes
where girls have attended boarding schools.
The Indians of the Southwest during the last year have improved
in industry, in the building of better homes, in the care and up- breed
ing of their stock. We believe the schools have had some influence
in bringing about the better conditions. Another thing is noticeable
and that is the desire of the Indians to have their childreneducated.
During the last year the difficulty was, not to fill the school, but
to know when to refuse to take more pupils.
This school enrolled 100
more than it should and then refused 60 to 70 who were eligible and
entitled to school. Opposition to schools is an unheard of thing, ex
cepting that it is vodced by a certa in class of people who do not care
to have the Indian educated or desire to find fault with the efforts
and policies of the government.
All pupils receive instruction in setting- up exercises, some mili
tary drill, the use of playground equipment, and the boys in baseball,
football, basketball, trakk work, etc. The girls are also instructed
in tennis and playground ball. The athletic director has charge of
this work for boys and girls.
There are many fullblood Indians in the Southwest for whom school
facilities were not furnished until recently. The Albuquerque school
is located right in the centre of the Indian country and should be
among the last to be discontinued. It is my opinion that there will
begreat need for this school for the next one hundred years.
