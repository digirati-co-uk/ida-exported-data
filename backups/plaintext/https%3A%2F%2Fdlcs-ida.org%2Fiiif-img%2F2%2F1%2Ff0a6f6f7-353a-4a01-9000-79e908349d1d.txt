Section lll..... Continued...SchoolGroves made a survey of the pueblo of Santo Domingo,( the most backwardin the state) and found these improved conditions obtai ned in homeswhere girls have attended boarding schools.The Indians of the Southwest during the last year have improvedin industry, in the building of better homes, in the care and up- breeding of their stock. We believe the schools have had some influencein bringing about the better conditions. Another thing is noticeableand that is the desire of the Indians to have their childreneducated.During the last year the difficulty was, not to fill the school, butto know when to refuse to take more pupils.This school enrolled 100more than it should and then refused 60 to 70 who were eligible andentitled to school. Opposition to schools is an unheard of thing, excepting that it is vodced by a certa in class of people who do not careto have the Indian educated or desire to find fault with the effortsand policies of the government.All pupils receive instruction in setting- up exercises, some military drill, the use of playground equipment, and the boys in baseball,football, basketball, trakk work, etc. The girls are also instructedin tennis and playground ball. The athletic director has charge ofthis work for boys and girls.There are many fullblood Indians in the Southwest for whom schoolfacilities were not furnished until recently. The Albuquerque schoolis located right in the centre of the Indian country and should beamong the last to be discontinued. It is my opinion that there willbegreat need for this school for the next one hundred years.12.
