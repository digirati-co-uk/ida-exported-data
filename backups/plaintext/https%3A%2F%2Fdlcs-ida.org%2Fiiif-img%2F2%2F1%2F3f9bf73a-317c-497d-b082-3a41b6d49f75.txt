CLASS SONG
Fare thee well our Alma Mater
Fare thee well our Santa Fe
All thy teachings we will cherish
All our learning will not perish.
Chorus
Hail to thee our Alma Mater
Hail to thee our Santa Fe
Fare thee well our Alma Mater
Fare thee well our Santa Fe.
Tell us not in tones of sadness
That our years of joy have gone
Sing a song in voice of gladness
For us life has just begun.
