In reply yo your letter of the 16th instant(" A" 5155-92),
zlative to my request to 2.11 bacon and purchase onions and pota
tes with the proceeds, I have the honor to say that I estimated
for the bacon for 1892 before I knew that the Indian chuI.dran dd
10t like baoon; And I .stime ted for 2000 pounds for 1893 expecting
to dispose of worse that we now have, and have a fresh supply for
the next year.
I have since learned shat I can exchange a los
hundred poimda of bacon( nat to exceed 1000 pornds) at 8 ponts par
pound for potatoes at 1 cent per pound,
It seems to me thia
of food
rould be a good exahance to make, as a greater variety is desirable
and potatoes are reasonable in price at 1 cent per pourid,
TL
you deem it advisable I should like to make the exchange as above.
Very respectfully,
Superintendent.
