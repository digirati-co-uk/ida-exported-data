EASTERI NAVAJO JURISDICTION
NARRATIVE
SECTION.
Section
IV
INDUSTRILS
.
The entire economic
situation
, referring
particularly
to
the Nava jo Indians
living off the reservation
, hinges upon the ability of the Government
to definitely
protect them as to their
rights upon the Public Domain through consolidation
of lands
with the railroad
company, the purchasing
of some tracts, and
the allotment
to individual
Indians as this is the foundation
of everything
else, homes, schools, livestock
industry, and
health work, and for 22 years I have put forth every endeavor
to bring about a better situation
in this respect and in the
last few years some progress
has been made.
Applications
for individual
allotments
for the present
has
been discontimed
until further consolidations
and purchases
can be made. It is very urgent that this work be concluded at
the earliest
possible date as this unsatisfactory
situation
has
been a barrier to the progress
of these Indians all these years
and their rights in many cases are now in jeopardy, and it is
only through very definite action on the part of Congress and
the Indian Bureau that we can hope to completely
remedy this
unsatisfactory
si tua tion.
The Nava jo is always hopeful and at times we have hoped
aga inst hope that plans could be effected whereby satisfactory
changes could be made and rights to their land perfected without
long delay in the future. It would seem that 22 years is entirely
too long a period to settle the land question for any tribe of
Indians
. The people of the state are unsympathetic
and not
favorable
to the Indians on the Public Domain receiving
allot
ments to which they are justly entitled, and it is often charged
that many Indians come from the reservation
in order to secure
allotments
, which is far from the truth, as the majority
of these
Indians have never lived upon the reservation
proper, but have
lived all their lives upon the public domain. However, as I have
said, some progress has been made in the direction
of securing
title through exchanges and at the present time some 23,000 acres
have been reconveyed to the United States for the benefit of the
Indians in those two townships
, but this is a very small begin
ning. Something
like 75,000 acres have been purchased
for the
use of the Indians, but there are approximately
7,000 Indians
living upon the public Domain within this jurisdiction
and every
individual
represents a specific case and requires some attention
in order to protect the improvements
which he may have there, and
his watering places as well as his range for his stock.
