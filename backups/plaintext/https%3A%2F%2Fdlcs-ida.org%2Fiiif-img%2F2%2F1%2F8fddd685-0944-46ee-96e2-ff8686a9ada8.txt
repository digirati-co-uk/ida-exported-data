U.S. INDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL,
Santa Fe, N. Mo, August 18, 1892.
To the Hon. Com'y of Indian Affairs,
Washington, D. C.
Sir:
I have the honor to again request that I be authorized to
make payment, amounting to$ 11.20, for the hand- cuffs, etc., as
covered by the two duplicate vouchers inelosed herewith,
I first
requested this authority in March, 1891.
Your office refused
authority at that time, and I wrote again under date of April 10th
1891, explaining why I purchased these articles. In reply to
( under date of April 22nd Education.)
the latter communication you asked me to" return the vouchers for
the further consideration of your office".
I returned the
vouchers with letter dated April 30th, but have never received a
reply.
These instruments are used only very rarely and in extreme
cases.
Where bad boys could be
secured by simply putting
them in the lock- up for a time, that means alone has been used,
However, it is possible that handcuffe will be needed some times.
Very respectfully,
Amient
Superintendent.
