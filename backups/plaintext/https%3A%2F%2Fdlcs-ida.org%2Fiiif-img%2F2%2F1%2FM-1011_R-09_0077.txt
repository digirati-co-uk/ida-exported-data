OF INDIANSRECHHIV HD 6.JUL 211910COURSE OF STUDYThe course of study has been completed and is in thehands of the printer. In all of its essentials it conformswith the courses of study used in the various states. Thetime has passed when people argue that Indian education shouldbe radically different in matters of procedure, subject- matter,and the general principles involved from elementary educationas it is carried on in the thousands of public schools scatteredthroughout the country. However, we have taken the best thatcan be found in several hundred such courses of study and adaptedthis material to our needs, with the result that our young peopleobtain a thoroughly common- sense education; furthermore, if theyso desire, it will serve them as a vehicle or stepping- stone forcontinuing their education in higher institutions of learningwherever they may beIn this connection, mention shoula be made of a veryimportant matter both to teachers and to administrators. Overall the country we hear the cry of alarm and criticism frombusiness men, manufacturers, and professional men that too manystudents leave the public schools without a thorough groundingin the elements of knowledge, namely, reading, writing, andarithmetic. In the aim to aaa more a√•vanced branches and togive instruction in the so- called classics, advanced mathematics,and the sciences, too many schools have lost sight of the fundamentals in education, and so in our Indian schools this is a matterof vital importance. It cannot be emphasized too strongly.
