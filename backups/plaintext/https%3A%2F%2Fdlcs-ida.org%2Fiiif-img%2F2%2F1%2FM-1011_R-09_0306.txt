Commi–ísioner of Indian Affairse econd edition which will soon be off the preseOne of the things that impressed us most was thatin requiring a pupil to give two years to the completion ofone grade in the common branches we were doing him and theGovernment an injustice, It has been demonstrated in otherinstitutions, which I might name, that by giving three hoursper day to academic work and the other half of the day toindustrial theory and practice, one grade each year can becovered; and, beginning with next September, we shall followthat line of procedure hereWe were, moreover, impressed with the necessity ofproviding for boys and girls of relatively advanced mentalattainmentg omething more than the merest grade work inthis school. A goodly percentage of the young people enrolled in this school the past year were of sufficient ageand attainments that if they had been els evwhere than in anIndian School, the chances are they would have been enrolledin first, second, third, or even fourth year high schoolIt occurred to us that by cutting out nonessentials in thegrades, and thus shortening up the time a pupil had to giveto the common branches, we could in many cases give pupilssomething more advanced in the way of technical instructionfrom the viewpoint of a secondary school. To that end, thenew vocational courses in agriculture, mechandio arts, homeeconomics, and nursing have been drawn up and promulgated forthe coming year. Each of the first three of these courseswill require three years, The preparatory course in nursingwill require only one,These courses are fully discussed in the catalogueand synopsis recently published, copy of which has been furnished to the Indian office. During the past year the linesof industrial instruction for boys were as follows: Blackeithing, carpentry, furniture making, shoemaking, masonry( including cement work), tailoring, sheet- metal work, paint. ng, plumbing and steam fitting, printing, steam engines andboilers, baking, farming. In order that the nature of thisinstruction might bear a closer res emblance to school workthan to mere shop work, an order was issued at the beginningof the school year requiring all instructors in industriallines to prepare work outlined a week ahead and to spend atleast thirty minutes every week in going over these outlineswith the pupils in the respective shops, This plan has beenvery satisfactory, and under the new courses of study recently promulgated, the plan will in all probability be considerably extended.
