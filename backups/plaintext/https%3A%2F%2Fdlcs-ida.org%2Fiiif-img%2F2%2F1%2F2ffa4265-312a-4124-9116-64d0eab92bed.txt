SFISDear Students,The disastrous events of September 11th have been traumatic for all of us in ourgreat nation, the Indian Nations, and here at the Santa Fe Indian School. When facedwith catastrophes of such a tragic nature and great magnitude, it is imperative that we askourselves what we can learn from these tragic events, and to think about how we can growstronger from what we have learned. As Native people, it is important that all of us reflecton the values that have been sustained by our ancestors and ourselves.The lessons to be learned are important to us all, but especially important to thegraduating seniors because it is they who will first step into a very challenging new world.And, it is they who will be tested at solving problems our forefathers would not havedreamed of encountering.Finally, the events of September 11th challenge us to think about our most basicvalues, about what aspects of our lives are most important to us. Again, as Nativeve been brought up to value our families and our communities. Itis incumbent upon today' s young people to aspire to the roles of leaders----- leaders whoseek guidance from the strength and wisdom of our native cultures. In addition, Iencourage all students to use what you have learned at Santa Fe Indian School to aspireto careers that serve the best interests of young people, your communities, your nation,and your world.Sincerely,Quel chestJoseph Abeyta, Superintendent5
