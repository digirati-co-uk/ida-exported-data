-26The elevation of the Tocito sandstone, which outcropson the apex of the Hogback dome, in 5153 feet above sealevel. The elevation of the same horizon on Rattlesnakeis 5340 feet; 5892 on Tocito and 4679 at Table Mesa.Itmight be said that Table Mesa is too low and that anytendency toward oil accumulation would be offset by thehigh head of water in the Dakota sandstone coming from itsoutcrop high on the flanks of the mountains to the west.This condition would not prevail then on the Tocito structure, as its elevation is greater than any of the others.For the sake of argument, conditions would perhaps bebetter for accumulation were this the sole factor, andthe outcrop of the Dakota is not a very great elevationabove that of the structure,The other feature, is the location of the structureswith respect to dikes and the mountain group to the west.Although the Table Mesa and Tocito structures are in closeproximity to plugs and dikes, it is thought by the writerthat they probably had no effect, so far as barriers areconcerned, in the two structures proving barren of oil inthe Dakota. As a matter of fact, the Rattlesnake structureis just a short distance from one of the largest plugs anddike systems in the vicinity, that of Shiprock itself.It is possible, however, that Table Mesa and Tocitohave been effected by a greater degree of me tamorphism throughtheir folding, as an analysis of a coal sample secured fromthe Tocito well in the Dakota sandstone showed a fixedcarbon ratio of 63. This is in line with the theory advocated by Dr. White, where the fixed carbon ratio is usedas a criterion in determining whether or not metamorphismhas advanced to such a degree that any accumulationorretention of oil would be impossible.Log of Well No. 2Rattlesnake.FromТоThickness0404555681751852703206507607648108358404045556817518527032065076076481083584084640510131071085503301104462556Tocito sandstone.
