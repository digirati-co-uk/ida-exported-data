The southeasternside of the structure contains rather steep dips, but thisarea is outside of the lowest closing con tour.The working out of this structure geologically was verydifficult, due to there being few outcrops to base a surveyupon. The Tocito sandstone lies 525 feet below the surfaceon the apex of the structure and work had to be done byusing thin, brown ferruginous stringers in the Mancos shale.This structure is so low as compared to the surroundingstructural areas that no hopes are held for the finding ofoil. A good 1500 barrel flow of soft, fresh water wasencountered in the Tocito sandstone, and practically everysandstone below that point has also carried water. The topof the Dakota was found at 1405 feet and considerable sulphurwater with it. This well is now shut down at 2005 feet inthe Nava jo sandstone.The 3,000 foot minimum drilling depth specified in theleases on the exploratory structures will take the TableMesa well into the lower part of the Wingate sandstone,without encountering any possible productive horizon, excepting that of the Dakota sandstone group, and all of thiscarried water.The test well on this structure, as previously mentioned,is being drilled by Mr. J. C. Ba iley and the Producers andRefiners Corporation.
