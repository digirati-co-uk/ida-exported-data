ADDRESS REPLY TOTHE ATTORNEY GONERALAND REFER TOINTIALS AND NUMBERDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICEWASHINGTON, D. C.230 Postof ice Building,Denver, Colorado, Dec. 8, 1928.George A H. Fraser, Esq.,special Assistant to the Attorney General,c/ o Pueblo LandsBoard,Santa Fe, New Mexico.My dear Mr.Fraser:Enclosed find bid of the Clark Quick- Printing Company,as requested in your letter of Dec. 6.Then it came,I didnot know that you had asked for bids and thought that itmust be some thing more about the check they never got, soI opened it.I suppose no harm is done, however.I note you may be back in Denver in about 10 days.I am in doubt whether I should ask Mrs. Hickman to cleanyour rooms at once. Of course Icannot see her todayanyway, this being Saturday so that she leaves before Icone. She likes best to clean your apartment on a Saturday,but will doubtless do it some other day if necessary. IsupposeI shall hear from you more definitely about that ina day or two.P. S. I wrote you about the sincerely,matter of bids a couple ofdays ago; but since I wrotethe above the Eastwood peoplhave called up to know if theycan see a similar bill to the one youwent and said they will be over for thatpurpose, so I suppose they are going to bid."
