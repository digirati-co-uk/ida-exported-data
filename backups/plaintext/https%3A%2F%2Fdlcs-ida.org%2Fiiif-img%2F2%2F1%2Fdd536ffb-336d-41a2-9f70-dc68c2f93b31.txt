Page 4NARRATIVE.Annual Report 1915.Section 1---- Law and order.It would be advisible if the Department could induce theState to deputise an employee here to keep at work along the railroad for the suppression of the 11quor traffic. A special liquorofficer for work along the Santa Fe is needed regularly.No intoxicating beverages are made by Indians in this reservetion and peyote or mes cal is not used.Licensed traders have been cautioned not to handle extracts,etc., where the proportion of alcohol is great. Nearly every traderhandles some" home remidies" but the trade is not great and theNavajos have considerably greater confidence in medicine given themby the Physicians. Confidence in the Physicians and hospital workamong the Navajos has greatly improved during the year.The liquor problem apparently is no greater now than it hasbeen for some years. If the reservation should by any chance beopened up or more mining developed around or on the reservation whichwould bring an influx of settlers the problem would be come greater.With twenty- four saloons at the railway point where practically alltrade of this reservation is done and drunken Whites and Mexicans acommon sight it cannot be wondered at that some Navajos follow intheir footsteps. The aim is to make the Indians self- supportingcitizens. With the continued sale of liquor to citizens at the mainrailway point the effect is bound to be noted on the reservation.If a special officer could be detailed for work along the Santa FeRailway south of the variaas Navajo reservations and keep at itconstantly the number of bootleggers would grow less.
