O
English languae under the supervision of an instructor.
There
should be suggestions in the curriculun as to how the teacher could
make herself the companion of both boys and girls.
I always found
it profitable to walk with the boys one way and the girls coming
back as they are not congenial during this level and always walk
separately.
It is very true that the suggestions of level B may be reviewed
nevertheless the aim of Level C is s.ltogether different and should
be written differently.
Other foring of overooming this timidity should be worked out
in detail in the curriculum.
The girls of this level are more
timid than the boys and will want to speak softly when they talk.
Another difficulty the children have at this stage of education
is the pronouns
.
Some few children have learned some pronouns
incidently but most of the class find them very confusing.
" He and She" should be taught after they know" Boy and Girl".
They are taught in the same way as" boy and girl" ie., going about
the group touching a boy and saying" He and then touching the girl
and saying" she" and having each child in the class do the same.
Also for forming the habit of saying" I am, He is, She is" threee
children stand in a group, a boy and a girl facing the speaker who is
first a boy and then a girl. The speaker says,
" I am a boy, or
I am a girl" in answer to the" Are you a boy" or" Are you a girl".
Then pointing to the boy, he says," He is a boy" and the Girl," She is
a girl."
In teaching," You are".
The speaker,( boy) asks." Am I a boy?"
Class answers," You are a boy."
