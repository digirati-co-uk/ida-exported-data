OEnglish languae under the supervision of an instructor.Thereshould be suggestions in the curriculun as to how the teacher couldmake herself the companion of both boys and girls.I always foundit profitable to walk with the boys one way and the girls comingback as they are not congenial during this level and always walkseparately.It is very true that the suggestions of level B may be reviewednevertheless the aim of Level C is s.ltogether different and shouldbe written differently.Other foring of overooming this timidity should be worked outin detail in the curriculum.The girls of this level are moretimid than the boys and will want to speak softly when they talk.Another difficulty the children have at this stage of educationis the pronouns.Some few children have learned some pronounsincidently but most of the class find them very confusing." He and She" should be taught after they know" Boy and Girl".They are taught in the same way as" boy and girl" ie., going aboutthe group touching a boy and saying" He and then touching the girland saying" she" and having each child in the class do the same.Also for forming the habit of saying" I am, He is, She is" threeechildren stand in a group, a boy and a girl facing the speaker who isfirst a boy and then a girl. The speaker says," I am a boy, orI am a girl" in answer to the" Are you a boy" or" Are you a girl".Then pointing to the boy, he says," He is a boy" and the Girl," She isa girl."In teaching," You are".The speaker,( boy) asks." Am I a boy?"Class answers," You are a boy."
