AFFAIRE
The fiscal year ending June 30, 1924, is marked
with a number of incidents that will be remembered at the
school for sometime to come.
The school opened the first week in September
and continued in session for forty weeks. The average
attendance for the year 1924 was 424, viith a total enroll
ment of 457.
Twenty- four pupils graduated from the eighth
grade. This is the largest class to graduate in the history
of the school. Among the graduates this year there were 15
Paiutes, 8 Washoes and one Shoshone. The average age of the
graduates was 18 years.
Due to the fact that the enlargement and remodel
ling of the schoolhouse was under progress the greater part
of the school year, the building could not be used for class
rooms until late in the year. The class roome were scattered
throughout several of the other buildings at the school and
this was a great handicap to school wor: in general. The
school building is now a tvo- story one and the school rooms
and halls are light and very satisfactory.
There were no chan es in the class room teachers
during the year, and the class roon work on the whole was very
satisfactory.
