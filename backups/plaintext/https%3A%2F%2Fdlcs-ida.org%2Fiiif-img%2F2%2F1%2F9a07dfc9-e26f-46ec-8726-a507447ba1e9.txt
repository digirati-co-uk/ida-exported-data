POPULATION.
1. W always have a number of business councils and
meetings among these people and the employees each yaer.
These are helpful to us and to the Indians alike.
We get on these committees and for judges the leaders and
most influential Indians in order to get best results.
These leaders take great interest in helping us help
their people.
These men are very friendly to this administration and I
do not know what I would do without their friendly help
and advice.
2. We have no annuities or shares from principals
of trust funds. Wo have but one individual Indian
account--- that is, one family only has individual
Indian monies with us.
