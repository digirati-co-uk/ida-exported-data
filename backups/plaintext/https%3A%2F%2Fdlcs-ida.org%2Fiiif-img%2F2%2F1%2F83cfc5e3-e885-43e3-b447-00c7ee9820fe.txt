-22.THE RATTLESNAKE OILFIELD.The second discovery of oil made in the Shiprockregion was on the Rattlesnake structure, located 8 milessouthwest of Shiprock, This structure is quite large andcontains approxima tely 10,000 acres within the lowestclosing contour line.A lease comprising 4800 acres is held on top of thestructure by the Santa Fe Company of New York City, havingbeen purchased at the Nava jo lease sale in October 1923.GEOLOGY AND TYPE OF STRUCTURE.The Rattlesnake structure holds the same positionstratigraphically in the geologic column that the Hog backfield does. The Tocito sandstone outcrops on both structuresand is underlain by approximately 800 feet of Mancos shale.In well No. 1 the top of the Dakota sandstone was foundat a depth of 821 feet. Thus it may be seen that the in terval from the top of the Tocito to the Dakota has increasedslightly over that found in Hogback, an increase of 49feet in about 13 miles.The Rattlesnake structure is an anticlinal type offold, whose axis trends north- northwest to south- southeast.The top of this structure is about 190 feet higher thanHogback and although the Dakota sandstone con ta ins waterback of the oil, it is not of sufficient head to cause itto flow. In well No. 2 the water rose to wi thin 60 feetof the surface and has maintained that level.This situation with respect to the underground waterwill probably have a bearing on the development of the lea seand the recovery of oil.QUALITY OF CRUDE.The crude oil found in Rattlesnake is similar to thatfound in Hogback, if anything slightly higher in gravity,approximately 64 degrees Baume, Instead of being goldenamber in color, the oil has more of a greenish cast than hasthe oil in Hogback and apparently is free from hydrogensulphide.Another feature of the field, which is unlike Hogback,is the fact that there is some gas present along with theoil, in sufficient quantities to cause the wells to flow byheads. No. 1 averages about 5 barrels of oil per day. Whenthe well is closed in for a few hours and then opened aga ina considerable head of gas has accumulated, enough to cause
