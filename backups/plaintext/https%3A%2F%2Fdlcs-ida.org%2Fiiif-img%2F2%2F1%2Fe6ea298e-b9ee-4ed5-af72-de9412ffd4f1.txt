These children need an endless amount of drill to gain the use
of" It" as it applies to things in the English language. Teacher
touches an object:" What is it?" They say," It is a table."
It
is a ch√©ir." A game of" there" may be played." Where is the ball?"
" It is under the table."
where am I?"
You are
in the corner,
Plural Pronouns( we- you- they) can be taught in this same manner
using the same drill, substituting several children for
one child.
There must be very much drill in having one and many referred
to as" You".
Place a label" You" upon one person and at the same
time put another label" You" upon a group.
Then have the group
and
the one person ask the same question, as" What am I doing?"
" What are we doing?"
To teach Non- English speaking children to use correctly the
past forms of verbs is no easy matter. Many games can be played to
accomplish this aim such as:
The teacher says or writes on the
board," Come to me". The child obeys and says," I came to you".
or the teacher says" Run to the door". and is replied by," I ran to
the door."
Other drill games teaching the parts of speech should be brought
into the curriculum.
Nearly all children like to" play act" or drama tize.
The Navajo
children naturally are a little tiid especially if there is much
talking.
I think a way of making dramatization enticing should be
worked out.
The handwork activity is an excellent time for teaching the new
language if the children can be persuaded to speak in English instead
of their native tongue.
This is a time when they should be taught
