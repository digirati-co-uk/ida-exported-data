...... School
The Albuquerque school is located in the Rio Grande valley,
one mile north of Albuquerque, a city of 35, 000, the largest in the
state.
The climate is dry and temperate. The altitude is 4949 feet
above sea level. The altitude and climatic conditions are ideal
for the pupils coming from the Rocky Mountain tribes; viz., the
Navajo, Zuni, Apache, Hopi, Ute and Pueblo of New Mexico. Pupils
coming from lower altitudes and damper climates are greatly ben
efited. The school has capacity for 450 boys and 400 girls, total
850. During the year, 501 boys and 402 girls were enrolled and
the average attendance for the school was 864. 7
When the hospital is erected and the central heating plant
completed,( work on the former will be started soon and is progress
ing nicely on the latter), the plant will be in fair condition.
To make it fairly complete and efficient, a building for en ployees
and a library should be added, as well as a cottage for the domestic
training of girls.
During the year, a concrete boiler house w ith metal doors and
windows has been erected; a one hundred horse power boiler installed
therein, and the central heating plant extended to four of the
main buildings. The lavatory annex to the small boys' building
has been enlarged; nineteen toilets, extensive wash sinks, twenty
