IORIGINALAlbuquerque Indian SchoolJuly 3, 1914.Section II---- Health.The health of the pupils has been generally good. There havebeen a number of cases of pleurisy among the boys, most of whom wereNavajos and undoubtedly had a latent tubercular infection before entering school. Six boys troubled in this way were returned home during the year, most of whom were in an improved condition but were obviously unfit pupils for a boarding school.One girl was sent home with pulmonary tuberculosis and diedsome two months later. This was the only death among pupils senthome and there have been no deaths at the school. Another girl wassent home because of chorea.There were nineteen cases of mumps, four of whooping cough andtwenty of chicken pox, all in a mild form.Twelve cases were operated for trachoma and treatment was continued in many of the old cases. No new cases have developed at theschool. Â· All pupils were vaccinated against small pox regardless ofprevious vaccination and all primary cases not taking were re- vaccinated.Care was exervised to prevent the spread of diseases from thecity and we congratulate ourselves on the fact that neither scarletfever nor measles, which were epidemic there for a time, were introducedin the school.The monthly weighing has been of great value in determining thephysical condition of the pupils and those found to be losing weightwere given special attention.The school building, hospital and dormitories were thoroughlyfumigated at the close of school in 1913 and now being fumigated. Theschool plant is in good sanitary condition.
