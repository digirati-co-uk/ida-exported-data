Section II---- Health.
The health of the pupils has been generally good. There have
been a number of cases of pleurisy among the boys, most of whom were
Navajos and undoubtedly had a latent tubercular infection before en
tering school. Six boys troubled in this way were returned home dur
ing the year, most of whom were in an improved condition but were ob
viously unfit pupils for a boarding school.
One girl was sent home with pulmonary tuberculosis and died
some two months later. This was the only death among pupils sent
home and there have been no deaths at the school. Another girl was
sent home because of chorea.
There were nineteen cases of mumps, four of whooping cough and
twenty of chicken pox, all in a mild form.
Twelve cases were operated for trachoma and treatment was con
tinued in many of the old cases. No new cases have developed at the
school. Â· All pupils were vaccinated against small pox regardless of
previous vaccination and all primary cases not taking were re- vaccinat
ed.
Care was exervised to prevent the spread of diseases from the
city and we congratulate ourselves on the fact that neither scarlet
fever nor measles, which were epidemic there for a time, were introduced
in the school.
The monthly weighing has been of great value in determining the
physical condition of the pupils and those found to be losing weight
were given special attention.
The school building, hospital and dormitories were thoroughly
fumigated at the close of school in 1913 and now being fumigated. The
school plant is in good sanitary condition.
