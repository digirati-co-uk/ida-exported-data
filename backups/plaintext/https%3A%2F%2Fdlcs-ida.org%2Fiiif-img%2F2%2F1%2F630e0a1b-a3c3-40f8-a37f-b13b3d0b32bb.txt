... SFIS is a special place, as special as life itself, fixed in
time, for us to share together as the stars in the night...
. Santa Fe Indian School.
Santa Fe Indian School is now
over one- hundred years
of age. This year 1998- 1999
honors the graduating seniors
who will be the last class of
this past 100 years. Santa Fe
Indian School has gone through
changes and movement. Fall
1998 unfolded into a series of
events which birthed the place
ment of North campus to eclipse
the previous St. Catherines In
dian School. Growth, tearing
down walls and renewal in
development of new buildings
was the focal of this 1998- 1999
year. The SFIS dedication and
commitment to overcome ob
stacles has been a driving force.
