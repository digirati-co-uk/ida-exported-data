The governorand council ofSanta Clara expected that this alfalfa seed, as had beenthe custom in the issuanceof supplies in the past, wouldbe issued to the heads of familios in the pueblo, and informed me in the early spring that the Indianswere readyto receive their alfalfa seed. I deemed this procedureat variancewith my plans for the intelligentassistanceto be renderedthe Indians through the farmer, to issuearbitrarilyto each head of a family a certainamount ofalfalfaseed without regard for the acreagein the individual cases to be planted in alfalfa, or with no means ofassurance that the Å¿eedwould be planted, and 11 planted,that it would be properly put in the ground,
