Santa Fe, 1.1., July 28, 1924.-13Another feature of the matter which has not beforebeen mentioned in my correspondence with the office, isthatine drive for the eradication of trachoma which hasbeen inaugurated by the Department( a movement which willhave to be continued for several years in order to beeffective), this area will be hard to control unless itis absolutely within the jurisdiction of the office. Itis true that a good many of the allotted Indians wouldbe outside of the proposed extention, but I still believe,as I frequently stated that if the extension were made,a majority of such outside allottees would ultimatelycome within the new boundaries of the reservation. Asto trachoma, it is as bad or worse in this area than itis in the reservation proper, and of course is there agreater menace to the white population than it is withinthe reservation boundaries,One feature of this matter which has been broughtup by those opposing the extension is that the Nava josare not now fully making use of the range they already own,in that they insist on keeping a large number of more orless useless ponies which eat up a great deal of grassthat could be much better used for productive stock.This is true, and in spite of the fact that it is a delicate and difficult subject to deal with, I have notfeiled whenever I have talked with the Indians, in councilor otherwise, to fully emphasize this fact. At the council held recently at Shiprock, I particularly broughtthat out, and believe that most of the Indians are atlast fully impressed with the necessity of attacking thisphase of their problem.LIVESTOCK.According to a memorandum han ded me by Dr. F. L.Schneider, of the Bureau of Animal Industry, there wereon January 1st last 686,000 sheep. 257,000 goats, 36,000cattle, and 67,000 horses on the Nava jo Reservation. Ido not know whether this includes the Crown Point areaor not, but in any case the number of horses is undoubtedly excessive,A great deal has been done in recent years by thegovernment to control the doureen eradication situationand it is exceedingly unfortunate that funds were notavailable this year to consummate the work which hasbeen very effectively commenced this year in that respect.
