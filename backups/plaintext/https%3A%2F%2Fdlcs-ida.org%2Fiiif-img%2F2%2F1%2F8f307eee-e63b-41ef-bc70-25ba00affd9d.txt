Canyon
de Chelly, 85 miles from Gallup, with
its principal
branches
, del Muerto and Monument
,
is about forty miles long. The sandy bed of the little
stream
( almost dry at time, at others brim full)
is hemmed
in by sheer walls of red sandstone
that
tower skyward
800 to 1500 feet; on either side are
pinnacles
, crags and towers of great height, sculp
tured by winds and rain, of these El Capitan stands
supreme. Canyon
del Muerto
gets its gruesome
name from the massacre
of Navajos
by Spaniards
in 1804. Scores of prehistoric
cliff dwellings
nestle
in high crevices
along the precipitous
rock walls;
the White House, Antelope
Ruins and Mummy
Cave
are the most widely known.
El Navajo Hotel, Gallup. New Mexico
The Navajo Indians
live in these canyons
in
the same primitive fashion
that they lived cen
turies ago when the Spaniards
first came.
