pueblos.
The pueblos north of Santa Fe-- Pecos, Te suque, Nambe,
Pojuaque, San Ildefonso, Santa Clara, San Juan, Picuris and
Taos-- with a population approximating 2064, were con
solidated with the Santa Fe school last year, the superin
tendent having administrative jurisdiction over the school
and pueblos. Taos is 75 miles north and a
little east of Santa Fe, Picuris 65 miles

north, San Juan 35 miles, and the other
and
pueblos within 30 miles of the capital city.
Roads
A Federal Aid highway runs from Santa Fe to
Taos, and state roads in fair upkeep branch
off to the other pueblos one to eight miles
from the highway, save Picuris which is 15 miles from the
Taos highway, over a mountain road difficult to negotiate
in winter season because of unusually deep snows on the divide.

from Spanish crown, approximated 147, 560 acres, of which
34, 800 acres or 232% were lost to the Indians

about 112, 750 acres, of which less than 39%
is cultivable and irrigable, with water there

Congressional action 49, 576 acres have been added to the
Northern Pueblos, giving them a total land area of about
162, 250 acres or little less than 80 acres to the individual
Indi an.
A brief resume of Pueblo history points to a few sig
nificant dates around which have centered movements for
their material and social advance:
1540- Pueblos visited by Coronado and in the half
century following by others for exploration
and colonization.
