Dear friend:
I return the receipt rolls again for your signature
on line number seven for December.
I guess you overlooked it
when you were signing before.
Please return it as soon as
you can and greatly oblige me.
I inclose an envelope to re
turn the papers in,
The children and employes are all well.
We hope you are
well too.
Very truly yours,
Elmer&. Harrison,
Asst. Supt.
