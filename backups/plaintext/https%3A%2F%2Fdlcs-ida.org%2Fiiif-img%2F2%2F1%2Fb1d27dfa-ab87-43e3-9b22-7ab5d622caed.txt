Supt. Reuben Perry,
Ft. Defiance, Ariz.
Dear Mr. Perry:
I have a Navaho woman veaving blankets at this school and teaching
the Pueblo girls the art that formerly was alone possessed by the Pueb
los, and which for many generations has been a lost art among them.
I find that to spin the warp takes much time, and I wnderstand that the
traders on your reservation are handling the woolen warp which is spun
at the mills. If this is 60, and I believe from what I can learn that
it is true, will you buy for me say about three pounds and send it to
me under Goy't frank. As this is school business you can do so. I will
remit as soon as you let me know the cost.
My weaver will go to St. Louis to spin during the Vair, and I de
sire to have her do as much work in advace as possible that I may know
her work better.
Trusting that this will not be too much trouble, I am
Very truly,

Superintendent.
P. S. I should like to get another good weaver from your reservation, as
여 A
I need two for the Fair.
