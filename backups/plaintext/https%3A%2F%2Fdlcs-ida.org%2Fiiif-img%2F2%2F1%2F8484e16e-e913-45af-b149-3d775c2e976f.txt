years old and a senior ai 5 F I. S.
I enlisted in the United
States Navy in 1946 for two years.
I took ny eight weeks boot train
ing in San Diego, California.
Then I was given five days' leave
in June 1946. I was kept in the
U. S. A, about nine months. After
that I was transferred overseas in
October of the same year.
During the second year I was
stationed in the Alutians. When my
year was up I came home and re
ceived my discharge at Seattle,
Washington in February 1948.
Here are various things I
learned in the navy: personal hy
giene and first aid; physical i
fitness, swimming and life saving;
naval customs and courtesies; con
struction and equipment of ships;
recognition of air crafts of the
navy; palinting; cleaning; and
maintainance.
Concerning my experience, I
might say that we traveled a great
deal and received a certain kind
of education in service,

TR. 5ior lass made a trip
to the way office on Wednes
day, 6: 5
we walced a few minutes for
the manager who took us upstairs.
There we saw about twenty girls
in a row sitting at the switch
bosrd. One girl was taking train
ing. It takes about three months
of training to become an operator.
Then we went into the information
operator' s division, Training in
this division is much harder than
that of an ordinary telephone ope
erator. It was very interesting to
watch them.
After this we went to a room
where the operators cook their
lunches and rested,
We saw such things as tall
dialing, special networks, radim
relay system, coaxing cable system,
modern Aladdin' s lamp and a multi
channel telephone. We all enjoyed
the trip very much,

GIRLS ENJOY WEAVING

Section two of the twelfth grade
girls go to arts and crafts all the
afternoon for weaving. First they
learn how to work the looms. They
then start on their weaving project.
They weave material for their em
broidery work, belts, scarfs, of all
kinds, luncheon sets, etc. The sr
ticles they make are sold at the
Srts and Crafts shop. They also
weave for people who put in orders.
The girls get half the money form
the sale of the artciles.
Not all girls weave. Some who
like to embroidery do embroidery
work. They draw their own designs
on a piece of paper and later fol
low that.
