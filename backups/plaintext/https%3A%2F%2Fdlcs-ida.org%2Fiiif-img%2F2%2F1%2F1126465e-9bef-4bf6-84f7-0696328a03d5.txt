Santa F Fe, N. M., Oct. 11, 1903.
r. C. F. Spader,
Jemez, N. M.
Dear Sir:
I learn that
cattle belonging to you and Mr. Stephen B. Whita ha vo
destroyed about all of the corn belonging to the Sia Indians. As they
have no other crops, this
becomes an unusual hardship. I learn that
Mr. White has offered to settle with the Indians for a nominal 8 um, in
no case more than$ 1.00 to each Indian.
I trust you will see that the
Sia Indians are justly remunerated for any loss they may have sustained,
and that they may not suffer thro any fault of yours or Mr. White's in
allowing your cattle to destroy their
corn.
I am very truly,
Banda
colo
Superintendent.
