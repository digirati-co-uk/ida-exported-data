Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. Commissioner:
Receipt is acknowledged of office card dated
September 5 requesting my narrative report for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1930.
As the Office is fully aware we have been
experiencing a great deal of trouble with floods,
necessitating the delay in opening our school until
September 15.
The blanks we have on hand are headed" Annual
Report 1929" and if these are not the correct blanks
kindly forward blanks required for the period ending
June 1930 and this matter will receive my immediate
attention.
Very truly yours,
KUhuru
J. E. Ba lmer,
Superintendent.
