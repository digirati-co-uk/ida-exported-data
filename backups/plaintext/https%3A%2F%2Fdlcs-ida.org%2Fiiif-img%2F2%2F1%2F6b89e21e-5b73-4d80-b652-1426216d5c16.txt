Section 1-LAW AND ORDER( Cont'a)strengthen and support the position of the Pueblo Governor andhis council. The proposed Simms Bill, in my opinion, would provemost helpful in the administration of Justice within the Pueblosand in rapprossing minor crimes and offenses.5.

These dances are of but one daysduration, are held at the Indian village, and I believe that theadvancementof the Indians is not seriously hampered as a result.( a) I believe that nothing would be gainedthrough efforts to discourage these dances,but that much offorts might tend to creato amoro intenso interest in them. The youngergeneration is gradually getting away fromthese ceremonios.( b) Children and returned students indulge inthe dances to somo extent.6. Marriage and Divorco Customs.( a) Practically all of these Indians belong tothe Catholic faith, and in nearly all instances,marriages among these people are performed bythe priest and in accordance with State laws.( b) No difficulty is encountered in havingthese people comply with State laws governingmarriago.( c) I am not deputized by the State to issue marriagelicenses.7. It is believed that the State laws aro adequate to meet allconditions, but these laws do not apply to Indians and IndianQrant lands, and therefore are ineffective. foderal legislationmuch as is outlined in the proposed Simms Bill no doubt wouldprovo beneficial.8. No Indian court is maintained at this Jurisdiction.91 The religious welfare of the Indians of this jurisdictionis entirely in the hands of the Catholic Church. Resident
