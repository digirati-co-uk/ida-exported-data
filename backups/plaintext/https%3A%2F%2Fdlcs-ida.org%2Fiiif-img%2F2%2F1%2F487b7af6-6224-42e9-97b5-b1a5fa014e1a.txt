Action of the Indian Bureau to
be noted in this Column.
at this place except to put on new roofs, to
protect the property until they are able to show
much better results,
Supt. informed the Inspector that he had
obtained authority to expend$ 350 to make this
dam and ditch; the same has cost$ 300, and he
says he is spending the remaining$ 50 in build
ing a much needed shed to store the school
wagons.
Should this dam prove a succes8 it will ruin
the present road from the school to the Agency,
and the next call will be for authority to build
a new one which will be quite expensive to make.
