Page Two.AFFAranereis maruAUG 15 1910 The Indians here know nothing aboutFFICE OF INDIANnot to my knowledge a pair on the reserve who akce joined together byany compact whatsoever more than a selection by heathen custom andthis latter consists merely in a mating quite similar to that of theanimals who live in pairs; there is very little domestic trouble.They seem to understand that each man must respect the other's selection of a Squaw and it is considerezd final. There has been but onecase of Squaw stealing since I came. This was immediately and positively remedied and I was supported by generla sentiment of the Indians. They seeming to think one man had no more right to steal another's Squaw than to take his horse; I know of no peciliar customsotherx than certain dances which I regard as harmless and the practicing of Medicine Men whihc latter is the most pernicious Indiancustom of which I have any knowledge. I am doing what I can to discourage these frauds and will give them a jail sentence if argumentwill not suffice; these Indians have never been in close contact withWhite people and are thoroughly heathen; there is no spirit of progresssion to be seen other than a disposition of some of the young ones towork which disposition is the only hope of these people. By supplyingthese willing ones with work, enouraging them in every way, and bringing some pressure to bear on the other able- bodied ones, I hope to dosomething for these Indians other than issue rations to them which appears about all that ever has been done for them.I asked for a court of Indian Offences but the Office deronelnied the request.
