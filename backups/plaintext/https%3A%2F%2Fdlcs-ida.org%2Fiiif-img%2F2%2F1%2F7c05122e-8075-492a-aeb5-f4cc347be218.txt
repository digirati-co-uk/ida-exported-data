SALUTATORY
The clock of our life as normal students
is stm'king
18 night,
and as we the nambers of the class of '99 sit here listening
to its
colling out the old and chiming
in the new days of our existence
vary+
ing fancies
speed through our minds and conflecting
emotions aris.
our breast
.
Among the many thoughts which present themselves
, there comes the
of the significance
of an accasion
which is honored by the presence of
30 many prominent people of Santa Fe, and which is surrounded
with
every outward sign and accompaniment
of joy and gladness.
In behalf of the class of '99 I extend to you a most hearty greet
ing, and would be- speak for those who are to constitute the class of
1900, the same earnest encouragement-
for I know that this gathering of
Iriends is not due simply to idle interest
and curiosty, but rather to
2 deep and kindly feeling of sympathy
from the hearts which beat in
unison
with
ours
.
This day witnesses the successful
ac coroplishment
of years of study
and years of discipiine
and the old sense of longing faint at first,
but waxing stronger as we neared the goal is felt no longer, In its
place has come a sense of joy, yes of exultation
; that we have stood
true to our colors through the long, long years or battle and are here
tonight
to wear the laural crown of victory.
We have had our days of dark despondency
, when the goal seemed to
recede as we advanced
and when there came a half- forned dread that our
strength
must fail re we had cross its magioline
, but bright eyed
Hope whispered
words of sweet encouragement
and stern faced Duty pro
ducing a scrol before our eyes pointed
in silence
to the legend--- No
CROSS
no Crown."
Our first great battle
in life has been fought and won, and now
the future stretches
before us, its long vistas festooned
with ill- de
fined but glorious
possibilities
,
The dawn of our new life has been broken most auspiciously
. Will
its noon- tide be as unciouder
, and will its sunset cast a mellow light
cver aspiration
realized
, and success achieved
?
God grant it may be so
bur ist us ever bear in mind that the best laid plans of men gang aft
agieo", so that if our fair sky becomes o'r cast by the clouds of dis
appointed hopes, we may learn to look beyond the gloom to the bright
land of eternity
.
The principles here taught us have sunk deeply into our hearts and
the foundations
of our careers have been laid broad and deep, but the
hour has come when we must put our hand to the superstructure
and
build on alone. But whether the edifice prove a thing of beauty or a
mis- shapen pile the work of the instructors has been well and nobly
done. Our gratitude to our Alma Mater and our appreciation
of her
kind fosterage
we cannot now adequately
show. For the words which we
speak in her honor, 12ke a wreath
of frail Clowers, will adorn her, but
