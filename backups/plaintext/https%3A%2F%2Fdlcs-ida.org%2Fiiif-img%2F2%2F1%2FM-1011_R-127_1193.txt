My dear Mr. Commissioner:
Referring to the Office letter
dated Oct. 16, 1928 relative to cost of medical work as
furnished in annual report for fiscal year 1928:
You refer me to page 7h and page 7i. Please note that
page 7i is for day schools and therefore not applicable
On page 7g we gave cost of physician,
nurse,
cook, which
are correct. One item of$ 20, 00 should have been added under
91, full- time physician,
column" Support& Civilization of
Indians tÂº
On page 7h there is no space allowed for food supplies
supplied from school funds. Note at bottom of page states
that these expenses are in connection with clinic of special
physician. This school had no such expense
Referring again to page 7g, there is a total charge of
$ 2460 against Indian Boarding schools for personal services
in hospital. In addition to this expense there is$ 400
. 00
for medical supplies and$ 470 for food supplies. However,
it was considered that this being expended for pupils was
not necessarily intended to be a charge against the hospi.
tal work. Food, especially, which was consumed in the hos
pi tal, would have been consumed by pupils whether in hospi
tal, or school dining room
This office considered these items carefully in getting
out the report, and as stated above, there seems to be no
provision made in the forms for food and medical supplies
when used directly in boarding school hospital and paid from
Indian Boarding schools funds
Very respectfully
