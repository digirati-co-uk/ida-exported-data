Classes were not heldin it as has been the custom. This was made possible by the building of the annex. Withmany new books added, both reference and fiction, there has been no need for students notto enjoy the library periods to the fullest. Every teacher has carried on a reading campaign this year. Now the students carry it on.The English Classes under Miss Gapen met in the library the first semester, and did alot of reading. In their journey through Bookland they read over 2100 books. The ReadA Book A Week Honor Roll, based on membership through the entire year, showed thefollowing members:Pauline Cadman, Imogene Chosemona, Zella Herman, Iola Nez, Elinor Sawtrom,Pauline S., Eva Atsitty, Lois Piwiki, James Anallo, Miguelita Pondo, John M.

These classes have made their own course. They have studiedIndians of America, beginning with those on the eastern coast, and moving westward studying all Indians as they went. When the classes reached the Southwest, it was the beginningof the second semester. Since that time they have been engaged in the study of Indiansof the Southwest. Mrs. Reichard will spend the summer in gathering, writing, and compiling all the material gathered into mimeographed lessons for classes next year. This willbe a very valuable addition to the library as an entire set is to be bound and placed on theshelves.Mrs. Canfield has been our librarian this year, and has made the library very attractiveand useful. A stranger stepping into the room full of students will find the decorum, interest, and atmosphere of any good, well administered library. Many employees have donatedbooks and so have many of the students.'The Cup Contest is an annual event which is sponsored by Mrs. Helen E. Lock of the— th grade English department.
