SECTION II----- HEALTH.( C ont' a).
The health or medical work during the past year
has accomplished much more that for the last preceeding
years. A tho. irdugh examination has been made of all
members of the Zuni tribe, Dr. Perkins has been here and
operated and treated eys needing attention. The field
matron and the field nnr se sent here by the" Eastern
Indian Association have been very active along health
1ines.
The most urgent need for carrying on the medical
and health work on the reservation is, as heretofore sta
ted, providing of 1iving, working quarters for the phy
sician and field matron, and the fi11ing of the field
matron position( now vacant) with a health worker
Also more suitable subsistence
for sick and underted
chitdren should be provided.

Should the field nur se, sent here by" The Eastern
Indian Association
", be permitted
to remain here regularly
we need no additional employees for the health work.
Should she not be left here, we need another field nurse,
regularly appointed by the Government.
The field matron has been directed to give especial
attention to care of babies, including cleanliness and
proper diet; to the betterment of home cooking and home
sanitation.
To reach the Indian women visite have been made
frequently to their homes. Mothers meetings have been
held. Demonstrations have been put on in the village
on the proper care af babies.
There being over 600 families, the field matron
is not able to utiit each family as often as is desired.

The reservation is too large to be properly covered
by one field na tron. She is located at the Zuni Pueblo.
This is centrally located in the reservation. Occasional
visits are made to the four principal outlying pueblos
when the weather permits,
