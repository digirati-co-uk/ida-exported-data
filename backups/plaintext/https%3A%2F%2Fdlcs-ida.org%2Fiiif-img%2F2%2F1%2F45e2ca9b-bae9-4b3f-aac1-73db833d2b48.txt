( a) Lighting. There is an appropriation this present yoar of$ 3,000.00
for a gasoline plant, I greatly desire however to have the school
lighted by electricity, and am sure that with this money tho wires etc.,
can be placed in position, and connection made with the Territorial
Penitentiary, and for a fixed and reasonable allowance light will be
furnished by them. The new Capitol building now being brocted will
be furnished light by the Penitentiary, and the new dynamo to be purc
chased could also furnish light for this school at not moro than
$ 500.00
per year.
( o} Heating Steam heating is necessary in the new school building
now being erected. The original plans and specifica
Sons of this building called for steam heating, but the same was left
out as the appropriation for the building was not surficient to include

priation and a sum not less than$ 1,500.00 should be authorized for

good, and the ventilation of the dormitories will be
properly attended to when the main building is roofed.

It is iny opinion that with this amount the proper congostions
to these buildings can be made, and also many or the old and worn out
pipes can be removed and replaced with new and better ones.

I have also the honor to call your attention to the fact that
a dormitory building for girls should be erected at this school.
All of the pupils now occupy the main school building, and there
can never be an increase to more than to pupils at this school until
a naw dormitory building is proov.d. This main building should be
exclusively ior boys, and I am positive that I would not have the least
trouble in filling it to its utmost capacity at any time.
