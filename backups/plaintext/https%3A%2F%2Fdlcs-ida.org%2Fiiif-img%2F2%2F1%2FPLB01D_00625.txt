the continuity of the ad
po ed upon
by claimant
The appeal as to the remaining
claims
presents
the single
question
of the sufficiency
of the evidence
to sustain
the find
ings of
the trial court as to adverse
possession
;
in each case
the claimant
had color of title and had paid all the taxes as
sessed
since
1902. In each case
the trial
court saw and heard
the witnesses
, and his findings
are not to be lightly
over
turned
. It would serve no useful
purpose to set out
the evi
dence
on each claim; much of the land
solved
uncu rated,
not irrigated, unfenced
, and of little value, the
claimant
would
cultivate
as small
tract near his house, and would use there
rest
for pasture
; being unfenced
, other cattle would
sometimes
graze on the land, either, with
or without
permission
of the
claimant
; sometimes
he is diligent
about
driving other
stock
off, and sometimes
not. The appellant
claims that such a pos.
session
is not sufficient
under the statute.

No hard
and fast rule can be laid down as to what acts
ire sufficient
to cr ite advers
possession
, ince all the
circumstances
, and particularly
the location
and nature of
the land, must be considered
. In Ewing
v. Burnet
, 11 Pet
41, 53, the Supreme Court
said:
" So much depends
on the nature
and situation
of the
property the u Ohich it ca
be applied, or to
rhich the o
ro claimant
may choo:
to apply it,
that
is difficult
to y down
any precise le, adapted
to all cases. But it may with
safety
be said, that where
acts of ownership
have
been
done upon land, which,
from
their nature, indicate
a
notorious
claim of prop
erty in it, and are continued
for twenty- one years, with
the knowledge
of an adverse
claimant
, without inter
ruption
