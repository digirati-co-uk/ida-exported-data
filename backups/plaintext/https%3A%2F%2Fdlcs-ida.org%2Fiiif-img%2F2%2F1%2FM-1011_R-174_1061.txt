utbilstojala:Report by F. Ellis Nielson, Agenoy Farmer, Zuni Indian Agenoy.There are five farming districts upon the Zuni Reservation,the main settlement at Zuni; Nutria, Pescada, Tekapa and OjoCaliente. Some water is available for irrigation at each ofthe se settlements while dry farming is used not only at thesettlements but along the valleys between them. At the mainvillage, at" uni, which lies below the Blackrock Irrigationproject is the largest irrigation area. This lies in the centerof the uni River valley and has a cultivated area of approximately 6300 acres only one- half of which is being used becauseof the scarcity of water caused by the silting of the Blackrockdam. The soil here is not as fertile as upon the other projectsof the Reservation, being a heavy adobe and wind- blown silt butbecause of the large number of Indians living adjacent and farminghere, is of the greatest importance to the Munis for their futurewelfare. While this area does not produce a large return pera cre; wheat, Alfalfa and garden produce is grown and an upperstorage reservoir which it is hoped may be constructed as soonas funds can be provided, would assure a permanent water supplyfor this section. Considerable dry farming is done in the Zuniarea, the principal crop being corn. This dry farming is gener-ally done along washes or arroyas, dams being constructed by theIndians allowing silt and sands to accumulate at each flood period. The heavy winds and sand storms from May until June haveto be contended with but it is an exceptionally bad year when acrop is not produced.The Nutria settlement is the highest in elevation and themost fertile of any part of the Reservation. There are 1000acres under cultivation, 500 of which are irrigated from waterfrom springs and that diverted from the Nutria creek. The Irrigation Department completed a diversion dam here this summer.The principal crops groun arei oats, wheat, corn, alfalfa, potatoes, beans and garden products. The crop in this section isgood and promi ses a good yield. However, the acreage is not aslarge as it should be due to the washing out of the diversiondam and the necessity of the farmers there replacing this whenplanting should have been done. Their gardens suffered becauseof water not being available until late in the season caused bythe early floods.Pescada is a very fertile farm district located upon thePescada branch of the" uni River. The irrigation water there isfrom permanent springs, a storage and diversion dam. Some 1000acres are under cultivation, the greater part being irrigated.Here, alfalfa, wheat, oats, potatoes, corn, beans and gardenvegetables are produced, the yeeld being double that of the Zunivalley. The Irrigation Department constructed a diversion andstorage dam and drained the water- logged lands the past yearand this settlement is growing. If it were not for a plague ofgrasshoppers in this vicinity the past season, the crop yieldwould be considerably above any previous year.Tekapa lies below the Zuni Village about six miles, on thebanks of the Zuni River and is inrigated by water diverted fromthe River and impounded in a storage reservoir. About 700 acresare in cultivation, the principal crops being, alfalfa, wheat,corn and garden truck. The soll is quite fertile due to thedeposit of silt from the River.
