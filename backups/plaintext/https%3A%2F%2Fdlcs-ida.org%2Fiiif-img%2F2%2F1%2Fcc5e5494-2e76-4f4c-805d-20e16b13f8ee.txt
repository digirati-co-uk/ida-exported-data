only suggestion I have to make with reference to handling
the problem is that our present laws be enforced. Local
and National prohibition have almost completely stopped
the traffio of intoxioants among the Indians and so far
as I have been able to ascertain has not increased the
use of drugs among them. I know of no Indians or others
on the Pueblo grants who are making their own beer, whis
key or wine for either home consumption or illicit sade.
So far as I know gambling under my jurisdiotion
is absolutely nil.
The only important decision handed down by the
Federal Courts applicable to this jurisdiction that has
come to my notice is that handed down by Judge Neblitt
in the Lonergan habeas corpus case. This was the case
where lr. Lonergan, former superintendent of the jurisdiction,
was sentenced to six months imprisonment for contempt of
court( State) in that he refused to obey the mandate of
the court and turn over to it various papers and insignia
of Pueblo officers belonging to the San Juan Indians. He
was purged of contempt and the court declared that the
Secretary of the Interior by his duly castituted re
presentative had exclusive jurisdiction in the manage
ment of the internal affairs of the Indians living on the
various pueblo grants in New Mexico.
I do not know of any legislation enacted by the
State during the past year involving traffic in liquor
or along these lines that is of interest or affect our
work among the Indians, excepting the Memorial to Con
gress by the State Legislature asking that the status
of the Indians be defined and recommending in effect, I
believe, that our jurisdiction be discontinued, and that
they be placed under the exclusive jurisdiotion of the
State.
