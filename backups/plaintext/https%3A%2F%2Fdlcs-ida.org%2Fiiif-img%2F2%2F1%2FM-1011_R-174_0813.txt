The Zuni Indians are not users of drugs.
These Indians do not manufacture beer, whiskey or wine for
home consumption or sale.
As stated above the prohibition law has not affected the se In
dians for the reason that they do not indulge in intoxicants.
With reference to gambling, there is a certain amount of the
old- time games, with small amounts bet on the outcome, indulged in
by the older Indians, and at the time of the stick races they bet
considerably on the outcome. As this is in the nature of an exchange
of commodities and very little inarm results, no effort is made by
this orice to stop these practices. However, some or the Indians
indulge in gambling with cards and when these games are discovered
the Indian police nas orders to stop them ana punish the offenders.
It is generally the younger Indians who gamble with cards and very
little trouble is experienced in stopping them as one warning is
generally sufficient.
No important decisions are known to have been rendered during
the past fiscal year by either Stete or Federal courts unless it is
the decision in the Arizona courts whereby the stock of Indians which
are pastured in that state are subject to taxation there.
No legislation has been enacted by the State involving the traf
fic of liquor or other lines affecting the work among the Indians.
