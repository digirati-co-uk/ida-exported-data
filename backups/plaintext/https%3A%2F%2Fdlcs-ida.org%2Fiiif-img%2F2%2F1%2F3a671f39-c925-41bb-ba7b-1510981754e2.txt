OSection III Health-( Cont'a)13. The Indian, in most of the villages, or pueblos, istaking a greater interest in the day school from year toyear and is learning to appreciate sene, which is asatisfaction to both teacher and superintendent.14. The Pueblo Indian does not care partioularly tomix with the Spanish- Americans.15. The expenses for 1926 for this agency were$ 77, 434. 69.The expenses for 1927 were$ 76,840. 10, 6594.69 lese in1927 or the present year. This is due more or less to theamount of building done. The expenses are thereforepractically the same this year as last.16. Fairly good use is made of playground apparatus.( a) The trouble with the modern playgroundapparatus, not only in the day schools butin the boarding schools, is that there isno proper supervision of the Indianchildren during the play period.( b) The same facilities are given to the girlsas to the boys.17. It seems to me that I have been answering questionNo. 7 for many years, at least trying to answer sane,and after thirty- five years in the Indian Service I amno better qualified to answer it than I was when I didso first, It looks to me now as though the day school* 111 have to be continued among the Pueblos indefinitely.These Indians at present pay no taxes and are unable tomaintain a public school. I am perhaps more responsiblefor these Indians not paying taxes, as better thantwenty years ago I was active in having a law passedexempting these Indians from taxation. I sometinesthink that I was wrong when I did so. As long as theyremain wards of the Government and pay no taxes theywill be unable to maintain a public school, and theyare not inclined, as I have heretofore stated, to mixwith the Spanish- American people or the Mexican peoplewhen they have an opportunity., J.
