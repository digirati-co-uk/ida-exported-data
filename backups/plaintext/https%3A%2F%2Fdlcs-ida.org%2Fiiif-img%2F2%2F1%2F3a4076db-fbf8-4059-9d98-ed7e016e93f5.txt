Some suggestions for improvement:
1." Books for reference only, as stated in the introduction.
My children kept asking for more books. They seemed to
enjoy reading and looking at books. I would suggest then,
that more time be spent on the Reservation becoming famil
iar with their environment, so texts and readers could be
written which would suit the interests and needs of the
Navajo children.
Standardized tests not sufficient. I would suggest just
using the Standardized test not more than once a year, and
have the teachers make test on the material the children
should know, and have covered.
3. Grouping of children not entirely satisfactory. I might
suggest grouping the children more according to their
social and chronological age, than has been done in the
past. Children with ages of 10 and 17 in the same group
certainly have very different interests and abilities.
Material in the curriculum could be condensed, by not
having repetitions, and having statements brief and concise.
One well written Unit by each teacher given in an interest
ing, helpful, and detailed manner would prove more worth
while than several Units of less importance.
6. I believe that the work in the various departments should
be correlated more with the work in the classrooms. Where

ever possible one teacher should handle as much of the work
as she can in her group, and have it connected with the
unit than in progress of development.
