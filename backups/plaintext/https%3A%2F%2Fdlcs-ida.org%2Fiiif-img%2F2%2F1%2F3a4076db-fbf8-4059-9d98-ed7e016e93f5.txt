Defects:2.Some suggestions for improvement:1." Books for reference only, as stated in the introduction.My children kept asking for more books. They seemed toenjoy reading and looking at books. I would suggest then,that more time be spent on the Reservation becoming familiar with their environment, so texts and readers could bewritten which would suit the interests and needs of theNavajo children.Standardized tests not sufficient. I would suggest justusing the Standardized test not more than once a year, andhave the teachers make test on the material the childrenshould know, and have covered.3. Grouping of children not entirely satisfactory. I mightsuggest grouping the children more according to theirsocial and chronological age, than has been done in thepast. Children with ages of 10 and 17 in the same groupcertainly have very different interests and abilities.Material in the curriculum could be condensed, by nothaving repetitions, and having statements brief and concise.One well written Unit by each teacher given in an interesting, helpful, and detailed manner would prove more worthwhile than several Units of less importance.6. I believe that the work in the various departments shouldbe correlated more with the work in the classrooms. Where4.5.ever possible one teacher should handle as much of the workas she can in her group, and have it connected with theunit than in progress of development.
