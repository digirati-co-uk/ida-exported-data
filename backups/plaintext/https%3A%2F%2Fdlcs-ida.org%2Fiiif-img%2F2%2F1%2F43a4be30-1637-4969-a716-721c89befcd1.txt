San Juan School and Agency.
This is manifest in their plans for improving their herds
and in the development of their irrigated tracts on the reserva
tion or under the Hogback ditch project, above referred to.
Special and continued efforts will be made to encourage these
ex- school children in making the most of their opportunities, which
the reservation affords.
The books furnished from the authorized list seem well
adapted to the school work.
The school is well equipped with buildings.
The present plan, formulated by the irrigation service, for
the protection of the school plant from the high waters of the
San Juan River should be carried on.
The protective work put in
place this year served the purpose. However, the water was only
ordinarily high, and there is no promise that sufficient work
has been done to withstand some of the rises of recent years.
During the year, under the irrigation service, a drainage
systema
was placed in the farm lands north of the school build
ings. This was successful in ridding the land of a considerable,
quantity of alkall surface water, which had all but ruined the
so11 within the past two or three years.
It is expected that
this soil will show further improvement next year.
