The Indians in question, therefore, had no owmership to transferto say nothing of the ir incompetence, or of the direct prohibitionagainst leases or other conveyances mentioned in plaintiff' sOriginal brie.The Pueblo Lands Aot, of course, lends no help todefendant.IL, as plaintif1 suggests, the individual Indianshere concerned had given an outright deed to defendant, it might( although Vod on its fase) const1 tate color of title and givedefendant a defensible right 14 he had held under 1t for tenyearswithout challenge. But he had held less than six years beforethis suit was brought, and therefore has acquired no title underany statute of limitation or any construction of that act2.

The act of 1834 duoroes the utter deal18ty of any" lease or other conveyance of lands, or of any titleor claim thereto, from ary Indian nation or tribe of Indians."The Candelaria case says that the Puo blos are within this statuteas tribes of Indians, Franklinvs. Lymoh, 233U. S. 269, 271,constrating the same section of the same Act, says:" As the tribecould not sell, thorofore, neither could the individual members,for they had neither an undivided interest in the tribal land norvendable interest in any particular tract." Under the Act of 1884therefore, as thus authoritatively construed, individual Indianscannot sell, and equally they cannot leas, because the Aot forbidsthe one as exploitly as the other. It matters nothing whether aleaseis achattel interest or not. It is undeniably an interestin land."
