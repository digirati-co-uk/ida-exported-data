tional nurse for night duty, and one more fireman for night duty at powerplant. Those four additional employees should- be allowed.The field nurse does not visit each family during the year.Being a R. N. and having public health experience does not solve ourfield nurse problem.One must also have tact, judgment, ability to drive acar, ride a horse, drive a team, and above all have the spirit, desire andpatience to help these people in their home life.It is the most difficultposition to fill satisfactorily that we have. The public health experiencerequirement, for the position, rather limits the fibld, and those who havehad that experience do not as a rule care for our particular work here.GO
