There are but few Zunis working off of the reservationasthe opportunities on the reserva tad on at the present time are somuch better that several who were working or the reservation havereturnedWelfare and Coial ConditionsI would state that the economic status of the Zunis at thepresent time is not very good. A very late spring, with highwinds, destroyed a great part of their crops and the agriculturaloutlook for the year is not promisingSince the order of the secretary of the Interior has closedparks and national monuments to machine- made Indian wares, therehas been a considerable demand for products along native arts anddrafts, in fact, more than can be produced locally. This will at.Lord work during the winter months when but little can be done onthe work in connection with the Reforestation.Family conditions upon the Zuni Reservation have not improvedas there are entirely too many Indian marriages and Indian divorsaise, The fact that an iridis an aivorce can be accomplished by eitherthe man or the woman leaving the home; while where legally arriod1t is necessary,to go through a process"of law before a divorcecan be obtained, encourages the Indian, and works against the logal marriage. A number who have been legally married have rear.ried without due process of law, and as the county of Ticials showbut little in terest when cases of this na tare are brought beforethem, it is a difficult problem for the superin tondent to solveas to what action should be taken in the case.But little difficulty is experienced at Zuni in handling theLaw and Order matters as but few indulge in intoxicants, and otherinfringements of the law are handled by the superintendent workingwith the officers of the villageSECT ON IIAgricultural DevelopmentThis was sent in in March as requested in CircularThe Use of LandsThere is attached here to the Annual Report of R.
