Jicarilla
Agency
New Mexico
There is but one public school on the reservation
and that is located on the grounds of the Pagosa Lumber
Company about one mile from the agency.
No Indians
were enrolled
during
the past year.
Four children were enrolled in non- reservation
schools.
The Reformed
Church Mission school near
Dulce had an enrollment
of fifty and the sanatorium
had twenty eight, thus showing a larger attendance
in
schools
than for several
years.
The sanatorium
places special emphasis
on the
health side and pupils are given only such classroom
work as individual
conditions
may warrant
.
Close
attention
is given to diet, rest, weights
, exercises
,
and hygiene
. Tribal apa thy growing
out of the heavy
mortality
in institutions
may be modified
by the
suscess of a few years work of the sanatorium
and
hospital.
Their
distrust
for institutions
may be
changed
to a feeling
of trust and support
as these
institutions
play their part in the health
betterment
.
