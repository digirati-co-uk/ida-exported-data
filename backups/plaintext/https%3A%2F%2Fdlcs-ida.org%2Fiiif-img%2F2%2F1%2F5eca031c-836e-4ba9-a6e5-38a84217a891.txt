They were very happy for they had meat to eatevery day.One morning the mother deer went to see the corn fields to seeif the corn was ready to be harvested.In the meantime the dangerous family from above had decidedto go to the foot of the mountain to see who lived there.The mother deer returned to her young ones and told them thatthe corn was ready to be harvested. They all sat down to dinner andas they were eating the youngest of the family smelled somethingwhich frightened him. They all jumped out doors to see who wascoming. They saw something coming down the hill. As they gotcloser they saw that it was the wolf family come down to makefriends with them. Finally they made friends with the wolf family.For many days they were good friends and their children usedto play hiking when the family above used to come to visit the deer.The mother deer told her children," If I am ever killed and thewolf brings you meat to eat, first put it to bake at the firemeat gives a sound like a whisper three times, that means I am killed,and don' t try to eat the meat."One day the mother wolf and her children came down to visitthe deer family. The wolf asked the mother deer to go down to theriver for a walk, and so they walked down to the river. As the motherdeer stooped down to drink the wolf jumped and caught her by thethroat, and so that ended the deer.That evening the mother wolf brought the meat to the youngdeer. When they put it on the fire to cook it gave a sound like awhisper three times and they knew that their mother was dead.When the mother wolf took the meat to their cave, the littlewolves were left at the house of the deer family.| One of the wolves asked the older why their hair was so pretty.The deer told him the reason their hair was so pretty was that theirmother always locked them in where there was a lot of smoke; thatsmoke would turn the wolves' h√†ir as white as snow.The deer got corn cobs and started a fire and locked the littlewolves in and shut every hole so the smoke wouldn' t escape. Thedeer stayed outside ready to run away. They told the wolves thatthey would have to stay shut in a certain length of time. The deerran away, but first, they made tracks in every direction so that themother wolf would not know which way they had gone.The little wolves died from the smoke in a few hours.When the mother wolf returned to the home of the deer and opened the door the smoke came out so thick that she couldn' t see, butfinally she went inside and found her little ones lying dead.She tried to track the deer but they had gone to their uncle atthe White lake where he lived in the middle of the lake. Here theywere safe from the wolf.lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIllillllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll-!|-|-|-||-----------|---|------------------ llllIl---|-|-|-|-|--|||----Page Thirty- seven
