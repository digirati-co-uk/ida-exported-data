Ft. Defiance, Ariz.
Dear Friend:
I have an Indian weaver from your reservation, a woman about 83 yrs.
of age, and she is kept busy weaving all the time. I aim to fach the
Pueblos the art of Navaho blanket weaving. I also exp.ot to send a
class in the Spring to St. Louis and keep them there throughout
the Fair. What I want now, is another young woman who is expert in
blanket weaving. I can pay her at loast$ 10, por month and everything
furnished. She can possibly make more. Now I would like to have you
find me a good decent girl or young woman tho≈° sabes the art, and I will
go out after her. Perhaps the tradors would give you the desired in
formation. I should want this woman for at least one year, as I should
expect her to go with the other girls to St. Louis.
Let me know what
yo il can do for me.
Respectfully,
Superintendent
