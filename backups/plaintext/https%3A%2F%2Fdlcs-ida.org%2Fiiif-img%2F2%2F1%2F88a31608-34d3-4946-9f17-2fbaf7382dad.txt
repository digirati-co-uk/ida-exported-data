Seven months later the enrollment was increased to ninety- three. Among thoseattending were 42 from the Pueblos, 34 Jicarilla Apaches, ll San Carlos Apaches; and Â· 6Navajos.

By 1915 the capacity of the school was 350 boarding students.Life at the school was rugged in those early days. Water had to be hauled forboth domestic and agriculturalpurposes. In spite of this, the barren land soon blossomed with many fruit trees, gardens, and ornamentalshrubs. The sewing room furnishedall of the clothing for the girls and mended the boy' s clothing. The students helpedto provide the school with food by working in the gardens and orchards.During the first world war the influence of the military could be seen on thecampus.
