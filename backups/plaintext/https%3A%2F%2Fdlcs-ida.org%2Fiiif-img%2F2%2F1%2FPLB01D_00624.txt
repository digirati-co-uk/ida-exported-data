The appella es upon a deed mad in 1818 by one
Quintana to the Puebl of San Felipe purporting to a
" a half ranch of untilled lands which ranch is between the
leagues of the Pueblos of Santo Domingo and San Felipe,"
the half conveyed

to by inheritance
from his deceased father, and which the

pellant contends is confirmatory of the deed of 1818; that in
strument is supposedly executed by an heir of Fernandez,
and not Quintana; it
refers to a conditional donation
of 1815,
and is of no assistance. There is no evidence that any pos.
session followed either of these instruments
, and we agree
with the trial court that the evidence concerning
them is too
shado
to serve as a muniment of title. The decree of the
court as to complaint No. 71 is affirmed.
THE ALGODONES CLAIMANTS.
The remaining appellees, in their answer, assert title by
adverse possession
, and also under a deed made by the Pueblo
of San Felipe in 1826. The trial court sustained their defense
on the ground of adverse possession, but denied relief to
others( who have not appealed) who also claimed under the
1826 deed. The record discloses no formal delivery of pos
under Fuch deed. The appella
