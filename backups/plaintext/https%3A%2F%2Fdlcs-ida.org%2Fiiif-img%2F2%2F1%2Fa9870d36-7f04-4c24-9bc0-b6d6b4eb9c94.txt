work. Indian girle, particularly our Southwestern Indiens, are coming to us
now from the schools with suffiolent training in Homo Economics for us to
place them in private homes where they can give satisfaction. In most cases,
of course, it is necessary for the Indian girls to take some apprentice train
ing in a private home at very small wages, after which their wages are raised
and in some cases we are able to transfer them to work in the surrounding in
stitutions such as hospitals, sanatoriume, orphanages, etc.
