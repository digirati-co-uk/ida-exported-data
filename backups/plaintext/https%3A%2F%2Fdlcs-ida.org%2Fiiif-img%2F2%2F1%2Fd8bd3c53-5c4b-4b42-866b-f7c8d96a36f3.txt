High School Academics
A Special Place
My school is special to me because it is part of my
INDIAN community. A place where my friends and
relatives and other people come together for a short time
to learn from one another. A place where my people' s
values are as precious as rain on a dry day and ideals are
nurtured as we do the corn in the fields.
Here, I learn about the needs and desires of my
people, my community, and I learn how I can help them
through remaining and participating with those I love.
Thus, we will remain one HOUSE, one VOICE, one
HEART and one MISSION: and that mission is to
strengthen and foster the INDIAN WAY OF LIFE.
From the way I' m taught and treated, I learn to
respect others, to have pride in myself, and to always be
socially, physically and spiritually strong.
I' ve learned that EDUCATION and WISDOM
happen whenever people speak with GOOD
THOUGHTS; and, that my teachers are all those who
help me to understand myself and the world.
There is a larger society, a larger world that I must
learn to live in, to survive in, but I must never forget
WHO I AM and WHERE I AM FROM. The PAST
helps me to see the FUTURE.
The basic skills of reading, writing, arithmetic I learn
not as tricks, but as means to help me reach an
understanding of all men' s commonality through books,
music, and customs.
As a young person, this is MY TIME to explore, to
seek new experiences and to walk new paths, but always
to remain true to my INDIAN SELF.
A SPECIAL PLACE, this school, as special as LIFE
itself, fixed in time, for us to share together as STARS
IN THE NIGHT.
