.NARRATIVE1920Section IVIndustriesJicarillaAgencyNew MexicoTh e total water storage available for irrigationon the reservationis estimatedat 1500 acre feet andsuch storage would not serve to exceed one thousandacres of the cultivated area. Not less than sevenhundred acres of the irrgable area is allotted andit is our purpose to get the larger portion of thisarea in alfalfa at the earliest possible date whichwill insure forage for winter feed for individualstock.All water for irrigation purposes is suppliedfrom storage lakes and it is excessively alkaline.La Jara lake shows considerable" black alkali" whichis but simple soda and its action on organic liferesults in the brown color from which it gets itsname.It is so corrosive that tender plant lifeis often destroyed and its effect on the soil isvery harmful. Its tendency to crust the soil surfaceand prevent even germination presents a problem andthe crust from year to year gets much harder to subdue.Fall plowing which will permit early spring seedingoften insures germination without the application ofWater and would therefore give better returns.
