V- Piold- Forestry
Annual Report, 1913
The timber on this reservation is all on unallotted lands.
Seventy- five per cent of this is ma tured and should be
sola in large sales for general market, and in the stump.
The method of logging best adapted to this region
is by rail.
The areas most liable to damage by fire are west and
north of the sawmill in the slashings. These ares are well
guarded by forest guards during the dry season.
