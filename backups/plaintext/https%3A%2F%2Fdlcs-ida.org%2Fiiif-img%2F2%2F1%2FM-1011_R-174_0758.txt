Section 1,( continued).
The Zunis are not addicted to gambling as are many other
Indians, although they will bet on their stick races, which are
a weekly affair during the summer months. They gambie in a
small way with the old fashionedIndian stick game, but very little
gambling with cards is indulged by them. Nothing has been done
except in a general way in discouraging gambling, both by the
missionaries and this office, towards stamping out the evil. A
few cases where card gambling was indulged in were stopped by
the Indian police, the offenders being told that if this was not
stopped that they would be handled through this office. This
was sufficient as no other report was received of gambling of
this nature.
No important decisions have been rendered during the fiscal
year to my knowledge, affecting the Indians, either by the State
or Federal courts.
