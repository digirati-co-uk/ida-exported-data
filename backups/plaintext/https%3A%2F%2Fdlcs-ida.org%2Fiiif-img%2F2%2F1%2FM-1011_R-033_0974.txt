ANNUAL REPRT 1927.NARRATIVE.Sec.2,ТЕАТун.PAGE 3, Eastern NavahoAgoy.The general health of the school for the past year was very good,with the exception of Impetigo, the disease being very perniciousand difficult of cure, At the beginning of vacation period nochildren were permitted to go home who were not cured 80 now thereremains not a single ca se for treat me nt and all pronounced curedbefore leaving.sanitary condition of the homes are showing some improvement,fewer Indians have vermin, more cupboarsd for food are noticableand at nearly all meetings, the subjects of health, cleanlinessand sanitation is brought up and when we find homes, cleanly andorderly we compliment them for their effort. Plans have beendrawn for a hospital and should be constructed at an early dateas the building now used for this purpose was not intended fora hospital and is poorly arranged. Our equipment is limited,special effort should be made to provide uptodate equipment whennon Hospital is constructed. Children in school who show loss inweight are given spesial diet and the last month of school alimited supply of goat milk was provided. Indians of the reservationwho show tubercular tendencies are induced to go Laguna Sanitariumor Fort Defiance, but little can be done for the advanced ca se 8.The eye situation in the' school was the best in this respect, thothere were a good many cases of sore eyes and, but little trechoma..A number of trachoma co se s still exist among the Indiansin the more isolated sections, that have not received treatmentthey seldom come in contact with the agency physician and areaverse to coming to the hospital for treatment as they are underthe influence of the Indian Medicine men. More physicians andequipment are badly needed that every family may be withinreach of a hospial and physicia.At this time we know of no cases of venerial disen.se, when evermy cases are found they are brought to agency hospital and notpermitted to leave until oured. There were fewer cases thepastyear than in 1926. The health situation in general is betterthan any former year. Field matrons can not operate to advantageas the Indian homes are widely scattered and if field ma trons wereprovided they could not keep in touch with any large number offamilies, tho there is a great opportunity for results in betterhome conditions for the right matron, who may have the courageto tackle a life of isolation and richly endowed with realmissionary spirtt.
