Hon. Commissioner o
The Fruit, shade trees, etc., herein asked for must be planted in the
proper way, and considerable fertilizer is required for this purpose,
The$ 126.96 for fruit shade trees etc., is a raro bargain as
can be seen from the prices herein given, which are less than one- fourth
the prices quoted in Denver or Kansas City, and as these trees were
grown within two milos of the school there is no doubt but what thoy
will prove successful.
other
le Gran Rivenburg of Santa Fe, N. ito, whose Nursery is located in
the Archbishop's garders must vacate in the Spring, and for that reason
is willing to dispose of the trees etc., at less than one- fourth the
regular prices.
There are no fruit trees at this school now and I am most anxious
to start a small orchard this yeer. I have the ground for the orchard
fenced in, and in such a location as to be quickly and easily irrigated
At anytime.
These trees will be planted in the proper way, and will
not be left to take care of themselves.
The shade trees are greatly needed here, and in a few years would
greatly add to the beauty of the place,
The Asparagus and Strawberries can be successfully grown, and
will be a most desirable addition to the school ration,
Very respectfully,
Your obedient servant.
