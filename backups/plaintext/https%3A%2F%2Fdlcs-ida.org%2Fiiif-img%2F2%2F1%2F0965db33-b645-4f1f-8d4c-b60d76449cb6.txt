OSanta Fe, N... July 28, 1924.-10in any stratebetweenthe Dakotasand the Pennsylvanians,that arrangementsmight be made there or on the Rattleenake for an actualPennsylvanientest,I am thereforeof the impressionthat every properconcessionshouldbe made to the Midwestto inducethem to make such deeptests, providingalwaysthat the governmentis sure ofsuch a test beforethe conceseionsare rede.I encloseherewitha map which has been preparedby my assistent, Mr. Ra√°cliffe, showingthe variousstructures in the Hogbackdistrictas now definitelyor tentatively determined.
