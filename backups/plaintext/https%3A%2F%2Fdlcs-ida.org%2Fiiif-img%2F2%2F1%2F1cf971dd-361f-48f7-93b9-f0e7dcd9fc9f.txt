8clbSeotion I---- Law and Order- Continued.ments were made practically at the discretion of the railroadcompany without regard to the value of the animal killed andin many cases, where the claim was made before a local justiceor some party not in the Indian Service, the Indian receivedvery little of the small amount paid over by the railroad company.The Superintendent has also taken up with theandlocal authorities, and even without their assistance,/ prosecutedthefts of horses and cattle and prevented trespass upon Indianlands by Whites and Mexicans living in the vicinity of theirgrants. A pernicious practice oarried on by the local authorities in the vicinity of the pueblo of Isleta by which they,in disregard or rather in defiance of all law, have mulctedthe Indians under trumped up charges of violation of State laws,has been broken up.The fact that the Superintendent is a practdeing lawyer has enabled him to do this without the hiring of legal assistance or any additional expense to the Government.
