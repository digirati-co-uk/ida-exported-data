1SynopsisofReport of Indian School Superintendent PileyontheKEAM'S CANON SCHOOL.--- 000February 2, 1887.After two days' journey I rcached this place, but found noschool, and I could not l carn that anything had been done towardthe organizationof one since my departure from Washington.However, being here, I thought it might be well to visit the.Hoquis Villages and learn from them personally their dispositionin the matter.Upon reaching the village I arranged for a meetingof the leading men.I conversed with them upon the subject.They claimed that they had waited so long for the promised schoolthat some of the children that they had intended to send had beenmarried and some had grown too large.All seemed to be anxious to have the school begin withoutdelay, and they pointed out many children that they vished to send.I see no reason to doubt their sincerity and from what I couldlearn, belicve that an attendance of over 80 can be secured.Several Navajons living on the west side of the reservation,over 100 miles fran the Agen cy, were found waiting for my returnto Keam's.They asked to be allowed to send their children andsaid they would send more than 100 if allowed to do 30.I can add nothing to the information on file concerning thebuildings, land, etc., at Keam's Canon, except to say that it isthe only point on the Moquis reservation that I know or can hear of
