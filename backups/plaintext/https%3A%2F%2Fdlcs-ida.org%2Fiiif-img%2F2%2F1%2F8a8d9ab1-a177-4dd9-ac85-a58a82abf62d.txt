food for food values

A farm unit
gives practice
in practically
all the processes
required
of tr. this
level
. Rhese processes

and selling of farm products
; the buying
of implements
used upon the farm; the use of the various
measures
, as, pint, quart, gallon
; peck, bush ell; inch, foot, yard, rod, mile.
Outcomes
: The unit gave practice
in working
together
sharing
It stressed
the right
attitude
toward
farmers
; it showed
our
;
dependence
upon them.
The children
gained
a knowledge
of the interdependence
of peo ples of different
localities
,
One outstanding
gain was to be seen in the children's
use of library
books
; in their ability
to look up references
. This type of work also developed
a desire
to be helpful
to others
. For instance
, a child
in looking
up something
pertaining
to his assignment
would
find something
pertaining
to another
child's
assignment
. He would
, in most instances
, with pleasure
call the other child's
attention
to what he had found.
The children's
geographical
knowledge
was broadened
. They made marked
improvement
in expressing
themselves
both orally
and in writing
.
This unit could easily
be made to lead into a unit on trans
portation.
