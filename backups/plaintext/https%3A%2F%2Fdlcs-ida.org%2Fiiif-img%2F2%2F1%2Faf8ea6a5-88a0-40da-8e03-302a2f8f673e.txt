In the middle of Humanities
Class of 2008 lies as one community
Hallway chaos at every ten- minute break
You hear 2008' s native tongue" j' kiddin" and
“ Hey punk"
" Hey loser"
" Hey dork"
yea, these are common greetings
They seem harsh but never lead to any sad beatings
Laughter is the soul of Class of 2008
Smiles make our days beyond great!
Did you hear that so and so is..
" Nah uh"
" You crazy"
“ Ahlac"
Yea that' s what she said...
Some of us have grills
Some of us wear specks
Some of us play sports
Some of us are considered dorky
And then they' re the ones who are ten minutes late
" Oh, duh, I get it"
" I knew that"
Whether were blonde, tired, feeling blue,
Nerdy, cool or just plain rez' d out
We love each other the same
Hugs are natural
Handshakes are rare
Belly pokes are always there
Someone falls
Everyone laughs
But it' s normal
Only because we' re cool like that...
“ Ah jus joking"
