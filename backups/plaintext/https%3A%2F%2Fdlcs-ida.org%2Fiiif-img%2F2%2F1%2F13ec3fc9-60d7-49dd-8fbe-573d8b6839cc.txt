A CRITICISM OR EVALUATION OF THE PRESENT CURRICULUM

Although the present curriculum as made last summer
is by no means& finished product, it seems as though it
18 a step in the right direction, Some of us have long
thought some thing should be done to make Navajo Indian
education more practical, so the curriculum was written,
An attempt was made to strive only for those objectives
that were not impossible to attain. Such objectives to
be reached through units of activity.
DEFECTS:

it a year, it is found many things need to be added, left
out, shifted to another level, or revised. It is impossible
to anticipate at first all the things needed of not needed.
b. Progress levels G and I need to be separated
from level F. The three were written as one level at first.
Too much material alone suitable for the home
economios de partment was included in the upper levels.
d. There is not enough subject matter suitable for
G and H levels.
No provision was made for practical Navajo number
aotivities.
