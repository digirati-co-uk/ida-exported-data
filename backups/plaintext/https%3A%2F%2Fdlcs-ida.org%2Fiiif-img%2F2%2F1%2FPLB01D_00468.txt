letter of November 22, 1932 to you and to the commissioner
or Indian Affairs, I attacked this bill on sveral round:
which I believe to be sound. None the less, if you should
conclude that the validity of the act is inddoubt, or
indeed in any event I think it would be worthwhile to
consider whether any comprani se resure could be agreed
upon vihich would satisfy the I idians and close this
controversy: This for the folloning reasons:
1. Although the additional amounts asked by the
Chavez bill are very excessive, yet, in my opinion, the
Board' s awards are probably too sna il
Adational awards are clared on to theories,
( a) that the board Tound that verious areas could not have
been recсrеrеr by the United States by seissonable prose
cution, and therefore awarded no compensation therefor
whereas in Teant they were recovereble;( b) that the Board
awarded compensation for a terriehts lost by the Indians
to the settiers on the basis that they were secondary rights
only, subjeot to recapture by the Indians whenever they
needed more water either for lands already irrigated or
for now irrigation on other land, thereas in Taot the
Indian priority had been los to the extor to which vauer
had become a urtenent to the land or Auccessful settlers
by beneficial IJss
