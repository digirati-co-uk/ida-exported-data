021July 24, 1914,Pueblo Day Schools, Albuquerque.NARRATIVESection V--- Field Forestry.S.The timber of this jurisdiction is confined to the grantsowned by the Pueblos of Isleta and Laguna, and the only timberof commercial value is upon the land of the Isletas.Some ofthis timber is ripe and an effort has been made to sell it, butowing to the fact that it is exceedingly hard to get at aproper price has not been offered, at least not one that theIndians would accept. It is believed that no loss will occurto the Indians, for the available timber supply in this sectionis becoming limited; therefore the timber belonging to theIndians is increasing in value and a price satisfactory to theIndians is expected within the next few years.The Indians appoint their own pueblo officials to lookafter the timber md prevent loss through fire, and there hasbeen no loss of this description during the year.
