Almost anything
in good easy literature
would be welcome
and useful
.
Aside from what the Deaprtment
furnishes
( books),
we have no literature
excepting
the Sunday
School
papers
that are
sont us from different
friends
,
I think
the children
would appreciate
a croquet
set, if you
could
give them one.
They have but few games of any kind,
Thanking
you for your kindness
, I am,
Very
respectfully
yours,
ant
Clear
Superintendent.
