15598A. I. P. C. ChairmanALLINDISO COUNCILCAN PUEBIt has been said, that only the educated are truly free. To receive the fullimpact of such a statement, one mustfirst define what is education, and themeaning of freedom.The first definition is one that we, asIndian people, are in the forefront innot only defining, but enacting. For us,education goes beyond classrooms orthe laboratories, the textbooks andgrading sheets. For us, education islife itself: the process of learning whowe are and the potentials we represent. Whereas, education has been defined as an egocentric endeavor, for usit is the process of being able to betterserve our communities and the everincreasing challenges faced by ourcommunities.This, to a great extent, is what make this school unique and exemplary. Curriculum, activities, policy and objectives, find direction from the served communitiesown members' input and guidance. The school is guided by the leadership of aschool board and administrative staff that see their youth as perhaps the greatestof all assets and the greatest hope for a brighter future. With this in mind, whatthe Santa Fe Indian School has strived to provide each of its students, is not onlythe knowledge imparted by books, but also the wise knowledge gained in learningthe fact that each of us is precious and invaluable in his or her own right. This, isthe freedom alluded to at the beginning of this statement. What this school hasattempted to establish is not education for its own sake, but education for thesake of those who tomorrow must inevitably lead others. The pride and responsiblility that goes with this task is what education is really alkabout. After yearsof struggles and uncertainties, the Santa Fe Indian School and its student bodyrepresent symbolically what we, as an Indian entity, can do, if righteousness,clear vision and other human resources are the impetus for our ideals.Delfin Lovato
