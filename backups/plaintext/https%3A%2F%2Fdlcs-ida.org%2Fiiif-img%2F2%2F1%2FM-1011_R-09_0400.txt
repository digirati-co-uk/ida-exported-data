NARRATIVE.Homov. ONE- 1812Section 1, Law and Order.Annual Report1912Carson Indian School.This being a nonreservation school no agency is maintained.It has been the custom in the past for the Superintendent of thisschool to exercise some oversight over the scattering Indians ofthis. vicinity, but during this year a position of Special IndianAgent, whose duties are to look after the detached Indians of thisState, has been established which has taken this work out of thehands of the School Superintendent; however I might state brieflythat the old Indian dances are sometimes held by the Indians living in the Carson valley and as far as I am able to learn the effect upon the participants does nothing toward raising the moralstandard among them which is low.There are but few legal marriages among them, it being thegeneral cust orn to follow the old Indian customs of marriage.But very little if anything is being done in the way ofreligious instruction to the adult Indians of this vicinity, thereason for this being that they are scattered over the country,findi ng employment at ranches generally, which makes it impossibleto get them together for religious services.There have been numerous convictions of parties accused offurnishing liquor to Indians but the fact remains that Indiansseem to experience but very little difficulty in obtaining liquorin any of the neighboring towns.The Indians of this vicinity are nearly all inveterategamblers, the women as well as the men indulging in this practice,cards being the usual method.
