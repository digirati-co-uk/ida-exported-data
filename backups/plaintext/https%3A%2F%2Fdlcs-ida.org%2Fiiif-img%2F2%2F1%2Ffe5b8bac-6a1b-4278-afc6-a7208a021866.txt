ValedictoryBy ANITA F. PADILLATo our superintendent, employees, and kind friends: I bring the message offarewell from the Class of 1931.We are indeed grateful as we realize that without the guidance of oursuperintendent, our principal, our teachers, and all others, who so willinglyrendered their help, we would not be where we are today. We appreciate theirclose care over us and their patience with us. They have taken the place ofour parents in caring for us while here. We must now go out into the pathof a new life; a path full of struggles and hardships and we hope to meet withsuccess at the end.If we should at times feel that we cannot go through these trials, may thespirit of the A. I.' S. encourage us.The Class of 1931 will never forget the kind help of our instructors. Toshow our appreciation, we will try to prove our worthiness and we hope thatthey may some day be proud of this class because of what we would haveachieved.Classmates, the last link that has bound us a class is broken. It is withsaddened hearts that we sit here looking into the faces of our dear friends whoshall ever be remembered by us.A. I. S. has long been our happy home. We have known each other formany years as one family, and it is sad to say that we must now part.I charge you with my best words, to keep in your minds and hearts allthat you have learned of good from this school, and so live in the future, thatyou may always be a credit to the Albuquerque Indian School.
