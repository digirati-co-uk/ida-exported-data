TeachingTomorrowseaders132 TOT 131, 67The class of' 94 is doing something unusual.They are teaching young Indian kids in differentpueblos throughout New Mexico and Arizona. Theprogram was started by the sophomore class of1991- 92 who wanted to teach other Indian youthabout science.The concept came from the students whothought it was a good idea that high school students talked to little kids in the elementary. Highschool students telling them as role models thatlearning can be fun and not boring.The lessons that are being taught are on drugs,space stations, teen pregnancy, and rockets, are allrelated to science. All the lessons that are beingtaught were all developed by students. The studentteachers thought it would be a real neat experiencebecause no one has ever prepared an educationprogram like this. The program will help youthrealize that high school students care about themand want them to go in a positive direction.Schools that got the lessons were the ones whoresponded to the letters sent to them. The schoolsthat have participated are San Juan, Santa Clara,Cochiti, San Felipe, Laguna, and Hopi.Students who are teaching todays youths aredoing a real good job!
