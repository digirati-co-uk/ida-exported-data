Hopi 27.
and Holbrook being finished in June. It is 76 miles long
and of first- class construction, We can now do business
in a more economical and business- like manner and be
in touch with civilization
continually.
The special Trachoma work among the Hopis and
Navajos of this reserve, by Dr. Ross and his outfit,
has been a wonderful thing for these Indians. Dr. ROSS
has done faithful and painstaking work. He has covered all
the Hopi communities and is now working among the
Navajos. He has been at Indian Wells, He is now camped
here in the Canon. He will then go to Sand Springs and
from there to the Pinon district. In that way he will have
camped in the four sections of the reserve and covered
all the Hopi reservation
in the best possible manner.
The Indians are co- operating heartily and friendly
with him and if the work is followed up as it should be
after he leaves we will eradicate that terrible disease
from this reserve. Dr. Ross has been given every pos
gible assistance
by this agency.
The Indians have not had any serious epidemios or
trouble here the past fiscal year.
This report should not be ended without this agency
offering thanks to the Office for its many helps over
rough places and its patience in extending advice and
instructions as well as allotments in times of need.
This attitude is valuable to us.
Respectfully submitted
