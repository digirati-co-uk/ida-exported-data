Sir:
In reply to office Letter, Education 22085, '98 of May 14,1898 I
desire to say that the conclusions drawn therein are unjust to me.
By the transferring of Mr. Lamar and the voluntary departure of
his wife and the promotion of Miss Silcott and Miss Busby, a gap or
considerable importance was left to be looked out for in order to
keep the work up to the mark.
Miss Dissette did not report for duty until the Ist of May and
sou one had to perform her duties as all the other teachers had
their full work assigned them, and
two out of the three extra teng
porary nominations were Indian 8.
The work of three teachers absent had to be supplied
I have no interest in the matter further than to keep up the orric
iency of the school and the temporary promotions made by me were in
the regular grades to which they were entitled by the work assigned
the.the
Very respectfully,
Supt.* Specl
