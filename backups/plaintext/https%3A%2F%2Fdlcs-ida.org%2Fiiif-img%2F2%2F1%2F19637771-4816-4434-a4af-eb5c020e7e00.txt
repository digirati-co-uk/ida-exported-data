ing of the girls'clothing and the boys underwear. Soveral of the girls
are capable of cutting and fitting dresses without any assistance.
BAKING.
All the baking for the school has been done by the baker with the ac
sistance of two or three large boys.
The bake- oven, made of sheet- iror,
is too small for the present needs of the school.
A brick oven of sui
able size should be constructed at once.
One of the boys who has wor√§d
in this department the past year, with a little more experience, will be
able to perform all the work connected with a well regulated bakery.
COOKING.
The work in the kitchen has been well conducted the past year.
Details have been made to assist the cook, generally, every two months
the plan is to keep four boys and two girls in the kitchen all the time
some of whom have experience in this kind of work. Owing to the smal?
i
mamber of girls in school, is necessary to detail boys to assist in the
kitchen. The dining- room work is performed principally by girls.
