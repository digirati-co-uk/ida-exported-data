It consists-- what thereis-- almost wholly of Pinyon and scrub cedar.( b) Pinyon.( c) Very thin.( a) The timber is old enough and as vigorous as the aridityof the soil will permit.( e) There has been no effort at reproduction of the forest.This can hardly be done until a system of irrigation is instituted. Theonly timber here consists of stragcling cedars and Pinyons on the foothills and a cluster now and then in the canyons.( f) None.forThe wood here is excellent, fire- wood and for litttle else-- certai nly there is not a log of saw timber on the reservationÂ· and there is sufficient for agency and for individual Indian use, forgood many years. What timber there is is fairly well distributed along the various arroyas and foothills.I have been unable as yet to get any authentic mapof the reservation, I applied to the U. S. Registrar of the Land Officeand was informed that he had no maps showing this reserve by townships,There xxxx have been probably ten cords of woodused at the a ency during the past year and forty or fifty fence postsfire. The timber is too far apart,gotten out. There is no danger fromand there is no undergrowth or tvegetation.The Indians express no interest in the timber except that they would like some summer range XKXXXXXXXXXXXXX where thereare trees and where there is snow water enough to produce grass.
