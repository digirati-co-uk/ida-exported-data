Annual ReportSantaFeNARRATIVESchoolSection IIHealthHealth conditions in the pueblos are not what they should be,due to lack of sanitation and sufficient medical force to insurethe adoption of preventative measures as well as to carry out thetreatment and administering of medicines prescribed by thephysiciansThe medical force at present consists of two regu lar physicians and one contract physician for the agency and a contractphysician for the boarding school. On recommendation of this of.fice Dr. Holt, regular physician stationed at San Juan,was relieved of Picuris pueblo, which was combined with Taos underDr. Williams, who entered on duty June 12th. This arrangementcannot but result in much benefit, both to Picuris and the otherpueblos in the territory which is covered by Dr. Holt, in thatit will insure more frequent visits to Picuris, of longer duration,and allow Dr. Holt more time for visiting Santa Clara, San Il.defonso, Tesuque and Namba pueblos which coinprise his districtIn my opinion Dr. Holt' s territory is now too large to se.cure the results we are working for, in that the distances aresuch as to necessitate the doctor spending the major part ofhis time on the road, which leaves too little opportunity forbuilding up the confidence of the Indians and for getting theint imate personal knowledge of pueblo conditions necessary ifsatisfactory progress is to be made in the treatment of sicknessand disease, and in the betterment of health conditions in thepueblosThe four pueblos in the southern division of this districtare under one regular physician, Dr. Brock, who is 9tationed atJemez. Here, again, the territory assigned is too extensiveIt is some forty- five miles from Jemez to Santo Domingo, and thedistance and difficulty of travel are such that visits cannot bemade to the pueblos with sufficient frequency. In considerationof this fact, and owing to the need for and amount of work whichshould be done by a physician at Santo Domingo, recommendationwill be made that Cochiti and Santo Domingo be combined underone regular physician stationed at Santo DomingoFrom observation of health conditions in the pueblos, I amstrongly impressed with the urgent need for field matrons. Onrecommendation of this office a field matron was established atSan Juan last May. On the several visits which I have made toSRINCE THE TREATMENT FREE PRESS STAFF REPRESENTATIE RIERRE HERE
