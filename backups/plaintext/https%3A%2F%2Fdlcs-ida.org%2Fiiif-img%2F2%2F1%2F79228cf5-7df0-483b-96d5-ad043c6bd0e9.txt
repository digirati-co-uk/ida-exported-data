ANNUAL NARRATIVE REPORTSCHOOL ACTIVITIES1933-1934General StatementbyM.J. Chadsey, PrincipalEastern Navajo SchoolThe Eastern Navajo School found that its teachingefficiency was handicapped by the lack of a curriculum whichaimed at being a guide in helping solve the specific problemsin education faced by itself in training Navajo pupils.Since no approved curriculum provided by higher authority wasavailable, it was decided to provide an experimental one forour local needs.This curriculum was prepared in a hektographed formduring the summer 1933, and used during the school year 19331934. A copy of this curriculum has been mailed to the Indianoffice. This summer( 1934) it is being revised.At the time the curriculum was compiled, it was realized that use would bring to light many faults. These imperfections would be corrected as fast as possible. It is real.ized that as conditions change, so must schools change to meetthem. For this reason we are trying to prevent our curriculumbecoming a fixed thing. We aim to keep it flexible, tentative,and experimental. In the past we have found that teachers toooften waste time in perfecting refined methods of teaching subject matter, which criticalanalysis, from the standpoint ofNave jo needs, does not justify being retained in the curriculum.Therefore, in constructing the curriculum, the committee has as its principal aim: to meet Navajo needs. Thismeans that it must correct any tendency to transplant a publicschool to the Navajo country. It must help the Navajos to understand, and solve their own problems, in a way which willenable them at the same time to understand and to fit intoAmerican civilization. The committee believes that at no timeshould an issue be made to choose between Navejo and whitecustoms. There is no need to make a bad Nevajo adaptation ofwhite civilization, or a foolish white approved adoption ofNavajo customs. What is needed is the development on the partof both peoples of a habit of mind which will recognize theproblems which must be solved, and then try to reach a sanesolution for the common welfare of all. This will make use ofthe best knowledge and experience of both races. Thus we recognize the fact that basically there is no need for a racialconflict. Our greatest difficulty lies in the human failing
