He expects,however, to continue his practice in Porto Rioo,During the last year, it has been nade possible bythe establishment of a little store on the school grounds, forthe Alumni Association to have a permanent secretary at theschool, Mrs Emily Peake Robitaille, Class 1893, was selectedfor this place and has been giving faithful attention to allAlumni affairs, carrying on most of the correspondence withthe graduates and returned students and editing the Alumninoted in the two school papers, in addition to her otherdutieBAs before stated, the system of grading the pupilshas been changed, so that instead of requiring two years tofinish a grade, only one year will now be required, Our planis to make each grade of work correspond as nearly as possibleto the same grade in the course of study for the average stateof the various states from which our pupils come, This planought logically to bring our course of study about on a parwith that of the state of Pennsylvania, There is only onereas on why we should attempt to run along lines parallel tothose of the state course of study for Pennsylvania, and thatis that many of our pupile spend a considerable portion oftheir term of enrollment here under our Outing System andattend schools maintained by the state or the locality. Iam not sure but that our requirements, grade for grade, aresomewhat higher than those of the state of Pennsylvania. Iknow that when pupile from our schools go under the Outingthey are almost invariably carried in the state schools fromone to three grades higher than here cannot tell whetherthey are graded in these state schools according to attainments, or according to age, It is a fact that the averageage of our students in any one grade is considerably higherthan the average age of pupils in the same grade in the statesohools; and I recognize also the pedagogical inexpedi enoyof putting a large boy, for example, into a class of youngstersseveral years his junior, Be all this as it may, in many instances during the past year when a pupil came in from theOuting, and showed me documentary evidence of having finishedgrade seven or eight, for example, in the country schools, hewas positively unable to carry the work of the Barne grade inthis school. I contemplate aeking our field agents for theOuting System to make this matter the subject of inquiry andinvestigation during the coming autumn and winter
