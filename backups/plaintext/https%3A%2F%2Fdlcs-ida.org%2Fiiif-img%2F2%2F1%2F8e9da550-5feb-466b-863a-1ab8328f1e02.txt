Jicar illa Indian School.
III Schools:
There are no public school privileges within the
reach of the Indian pupils of this reservation, hence, there is
no relationship existing between the Indian schools and the pub
lic schools.
The State course of study, which is very well
adapted for the use of the Indian schools of this reservation,
is furnished for the teachers and the work is outlined as near
ly as possible to compare with the same.
The industrial training given in the school for
boys and girls is confined principally to the duties connected
with a Boarding school, changes of details, to the different
departments, being made monthly. The girls have training in sew
ing, cooking, laundering, earing for the slek. The boys are
given training in engineering, steam heating, caring for stock,
carpentering and painting.
The school plant, generally speaking, is in ex
cellent condition, with the exception of the lighting system,
which is inadequate.
Tarming bas not been successful on the account
of not having available water for irrigating purposes. However,
the prospects for the future are better, as a ditch has been ex
tended, which will irrigate a part of the school farm.
