Education Bivision, School Sectionstion,posRECHIVEDAUG2-1910The Pueblo Indians generally marry in accordance withthe laws of the Territory. There have been a few exceptions duringthe year. The Navajos marry according to Indian rites. The morality of these Indians will average high, but those who congregate atAlbuquerque and other places for the sale of pottery, etc., donot have as high a standard of marality as those remaining attheir homes and engaging in agricultural pursuits. The moral conduct of the pupils of this school has been above reproach and asgood as it could be in a boarding school for white pupils. Theboys and girls meet at Saturday evening socials and at partiesgiven by themselves, and their conduct on such occasions and allother occasions has been exemplary. The boys have acted as perfectgentlemen and the girls are always ladies.The Pueblo Indian, so far as his old and peculiar customsare concerned, excepting the Lagunas and a number of the Isletas,have made but little progress; but in the way of farming, stockraising ad other pursuits pertaining to their material welfare,they are reasonably progressive and I think farthe advanced thanthe native New Mexico population.There is no Court of Indian Offences among the PuebleIndians and cannot be for the reason that they are citizens andare amenable to the laws of the Territory and would not be subject to a Court of Indian Offences.In gardening, farming, care of stock, irrigation work,carpentering and blacksmithing, the boys are getting the trainingthat they will need at their homes and getting it in a way to enable them to put it to practical use at home. It is true thefarm and garden at this school are rather small, but the acreageunder cultivation is as large or larger than the average Indianfarm can be and the methods of farming and irrigation are thesame as the Indians should use at their homes. The improvementof the soil at the school furnishes good examples for the Indiansat their homes. The training the girls receive at the boardingschool can be put to practical use in their homes.- 8-
