Materials unsuited to Progress Level E- 21.I believe in some places too large groupings are suggested.It seems to me that it would not be wise to take up thesubjects of food, clothing, all in one year. Rather Iwould suggest taking up just one phase of a subject suchas the" Study of Corn." Most of the worthwhile materialcould be envolved without covering too much ground.2.It suggested in one place" to think a sentence through beTore speaking." I believe that would inhibit a lot ofspontaneousness that you might otherwise obtain from thechildren. I think our first consideration should be toallow the children to express their thoughts freely without so much attention to form.There seems to be not suggested vocabulary list for thislevel. Such a list might prove helpful.3.4.Not enough was included in the Arithmetic objectives, ifthe children are to do acceptable work in the Standardizedtest.I would suggest more of problemsolv√®ing connedtedwith the Unit.5.Under the subject of Social Activities, I would suggestthat the activities consist of really doing these variousthings as far as possible, instead of so much discussion.
