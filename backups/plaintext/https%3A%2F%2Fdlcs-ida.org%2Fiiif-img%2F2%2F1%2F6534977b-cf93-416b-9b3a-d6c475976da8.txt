Materials unsuited to Progress Level E- 2
1.
I believe in some places too large groupings are suggested.
It seems to me that it would not be wise to take up the
subjects of food, clothing, all in one year. Rather I
would suggest taking up just one phase of a subject such
as the" Study of Corn." Most of the worthwhile material
could be envolved without covering too much ground.
2.
It suggested in one place" to think a sentence through be
Tore speaking." I believe that would inhibit a lot of
spontaneousness that you might otherwise obtain from the
children. I think our first consideration should be to
allow the children to express their thoughts freely with
out so much attention to form.
There seems to be not suggested vocabulary list for this
level. Such a list might prove helpful.
3.
4.
Not enough was included in the Arithmetic objectives, if
the children are to do acceptable work in the Standardized
test.
I would suggest more of problem
solv√®ing connedted
with the Unit.
5.
Under the subject of Social Activities, I would suggest
that the activities consist of really doing these various
things as far as possible, instead of so much discussion.
