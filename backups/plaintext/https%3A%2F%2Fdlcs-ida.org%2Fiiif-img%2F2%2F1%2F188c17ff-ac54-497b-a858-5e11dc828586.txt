Pulled 5 joints and shut down.TOCITO STRUCTURE.This structure, which was considered the most ideal,has given many disappointments. The Gypsy Oil Companyof Oklahoma purchased the Tocito tract for$ 46,000 andhave been splendidly equipped for the drilling of thetest well. Satisfactory progress has been made in theface of great odds, as most of the drilling below the842 foot depth has been with a hole full of water. Thesame situation exists in this well as it does in TableMesa, so far as water is concerned and practically everysandstone encountered has carried some water. In thiswell, however, the water is soft and fresh, no sulphurwater having been found.Discussion has already been made relative to thebarrenness of this structure and nothing more can be said.It is believed that oil production might possibly bepicked up in the Shinarump conglomerate at approximately3,100 feet to 3200 feet. A final depth of 3022 feethas been reached in this well and the Gypsy Company hasthereby fulfilled their contract without encounteringa show of oil. They have pulled all casing from the holeexcept the 15" and the 121" and arrangements have beenmade with the Indian Department for the purchase of thewell as a water well.Log of Tocito Well04510045100350350709709759Gray sand.Tocito.Dry.Sand and shale.Dark gray to black shale with thin,fine sandstone laminae.
