and, naturally, is very discouraging to any person who wants to
lind employment and needs work with nothing to be offered.
TO
remedy the situation, we are urging through the chapter organ
izations that every person, every young man, or family increase
cultivated areas this year and endeavor to raise more potatoes,
beans, squash than ever before in order to provide subsistence
which they are now wable to buy as there is no market for their
products at this time. We are urging the Indians to discontinue
making saddle blankets or poorly- made blankets of any kind, but
if they will endeavor to prepare their wool in a better manner,
to take more pains in the spinning, carding, and weaving of their
rugs and adopt designs which will result in the making of a rug
of good type and pattern, they can always find a market but there
is no sale or demand whatever for the poor grade with which they
have been flooding the market, and we believe with such advice
carried into effect, we may be able in a small way to improve
the present sub- normal economic situation.
The academic work has received serious attention with all
teachers working under a definite daily program which means much
for the efficiency of the work. Girls receive some instruction
in home training and home economics and the boys in shop work,
farming and gardening, but we so rely need facilities to malce our
instruction and work more effective. Increased expenditures for
subsistence permits of better rations and menus than ever before
and I doubt if there is any school in the southwest that provides
better food for their children than the Eastern Navajo Boarding
School, and the noonday meal for the children at the pinedale
Day School. Provision must be made to furnish noonday lunches
for Indian pupils in the public schools as but few of them have
the proper food with which to prepare lunches from.
It will be necessary to maintain Government- supervised
schools within the Navajo country for a great number of years for
the reason that there are a few white people living within the
Indian country and it would not be possible to establish and
ma intain public day schools in the country and it will be a long
period of time before the Indians will be financially able to
maintain such schools, even if they had the disposition to do so.
