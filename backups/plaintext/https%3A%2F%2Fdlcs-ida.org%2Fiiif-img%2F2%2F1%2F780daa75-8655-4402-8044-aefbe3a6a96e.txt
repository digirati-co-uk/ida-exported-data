Leupp Indian School& AgencyLeapp, ArizonaSection IIINarrative.Schools. Cont' d.Here on the Little Colorado River there is an abundance of goodwater. This alone is enough to be a determining factor in the futuredevelopment of school facilities for the education of the largenumber of Navajo children of school age yet to be provided for.But it is also close to railroad teansportation, and there isnever a time when heavy loads cannot be brought from the station atCanyon Diablo thirteen miles distant. Our truck easily ma kes troloads a day.The altitude is four thousand feet and extremes of eitherheat or cold are rare. It would be ideal for a large hospital.There is a splendid quarry of brown sandstone within one andOne- half miles of the school and the rock can be got out at minimumexpense.I have emphasized the necessity for the students to acquirea comprehensive knowledge of the English language. If a school doesnot do this for the Indian it is a failure no matter what else itclaims to have accomplished. Next is the acquiring of a vocation.The greatest success is attained by those who specialize.And no school can properly fit its students for the battle of lifeunless it is large enough to handle the vocational courses thoroughly well.This little school has adapted itself to the needs of the Indian in so far as it possibly can. English and industries are carriedas far as our limited facilities will permit.But both efficiency and economy demand that the school bereconstructed on a larger plan in every way.Financially the past year has been one of making ends meetif possible, and doing without, Conditions were so extraordinary thatno fair comparison can be made with any normal year.
