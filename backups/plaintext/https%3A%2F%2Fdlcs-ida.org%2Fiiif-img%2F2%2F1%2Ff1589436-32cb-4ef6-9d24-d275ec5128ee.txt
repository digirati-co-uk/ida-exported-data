324Santa Fe, N.M., Fab'y. 4th, 1896.The Hon. Comissionerof Indian Affairs,Washington, D.C.Sir:I have the honour to report that the brick iaundry- buildingis in bat condition. It was originally badly constructed, only onebrick in thickness and two stories high. The window and door frames arenow so far from the walls that they fall out in every heavy wind, and,although, having been wedged in, they soon get loose again by shrinkageof the walls. When the staar- enging and laundry is at work, the buildering shakas so much that I am fearful of some serious accident, unlessI an authorized to make some decided change in the way repairs to it.' I an informed that the walls might be strengthened by abutments out-side and iron rods through it; but as my pre ontappropriation willnot allow noney enough to nake the repairs, I cannot ask the authority.I, therefore, hope that you can raake some arrangements wi th the Hon.Serstary of the interior, by which money enough from the general fundset aside to be expended at his discretion can be had to make this yearbuilding at least safe from falling down and killing some one,If you can secure the money, I will make an estimate and send it to youbut I do not believeit can be made perfectly safe under an axpenditure
