A barn is needed for use in housing the team
used by the physician, for the storage of feed for tean,
buggy and other supplies. At present a very small space
is rented to house the team- the rig for his use standing
out of doors, subject to injury by the weather at all
seasons of the year. It is very urgently recommended
that quarters for the physician be constructed at an early
date, which will be a credit to the Government.
A building for use of the field matron. This
is urgently needed in order to provide suitable living
quarters and quarters for her to meet the Indian women
and working quarters wherein the Indian woinen will have
opportunity to do family sewing, laundry, etc. At present
samill rented quarters, consisting of three stall rooms,
unsuitable for hunan habitation are provided for the
field matron. They are by no means large enough, or suit
able for quarters in which to live and provide place for
work with the Indian women, however nothing better is avail
able
Tand has been reserved at the Pueblo adjacent to
the Day School, where quarters for the physician and field
matron may be placed and connected up with the Day School
water system and sewer system
