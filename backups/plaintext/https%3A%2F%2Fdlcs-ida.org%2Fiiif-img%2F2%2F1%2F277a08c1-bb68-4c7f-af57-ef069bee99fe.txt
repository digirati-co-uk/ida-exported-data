the high school and will be able to graduate in two years.
In this connection I desire to state that Cruz Sandoval and
Concha Leon, who graduated from the 3th grade at this school four
years ago, have just finished the high school course and receiv
ed their diplomas and expect to teach this coming year. Concha
Leon has already been employed in one of the public schools.
This report should not be closed without mentioning the s
school band, its part in the year' s work and the advancement male
by its members. The band has been ably instructed by Mr. Robt.
B. Haymes, Assistant Disciplinarian and is believed to be the best
organization of its kind in the State. At present it is composed
of 28 pieces. It has furnished music on all important occasions
in the city of Albuquerque and was engaged by the State Fair Asso
ciation for the fairweek last October and has been engaged to fur
nish music for the next State Fair. The organization furnished
concerts in the city park during the summer months last season.
The school band has luring the last year or more been highly ap
preciated by the citizens of Albuquerque and the State. During
commencement week it aided with the various programs and furnished
a concert each evening at 7: 00. Twenty- one beginners have been
started in band music as a second organization and were discours
ing good music at the close of school. It will be necessary to
supply the band with some new instruments early in the fiscal
year 1917.
