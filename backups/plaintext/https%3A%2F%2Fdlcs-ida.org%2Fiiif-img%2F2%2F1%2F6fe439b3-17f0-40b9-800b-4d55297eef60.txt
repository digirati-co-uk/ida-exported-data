Confiscationof artiolos for introduotingliquor.None.COMMENTS.The State officers have not been asked to cooperatein suppressingtheliquor traffic among the Indians. Usually the action of the courts of thiscounty does not justify one in making much of an effort to secure indietments for selling liquor to Indians.There is quite a large illegal liquortraffio going on among these Indians, but owing to the great area to becovered it has been impossible to secure convicting evidence. The Mexioans along the eastern border of the reservation frequently come on the rereservationwith liquor and are gone again before we learn that they arethere. The same thing happens on the south border close to the railroad.It would take the entire time of one man to properly control this traffic.Several requests for a Special Officer have been made, but none of therequests granted.
