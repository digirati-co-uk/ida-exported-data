The operating room of which one corner is here shown is a large
bathroom. but serves admirably for the purpose it is being used,
being well lighted. Walls and woodwork are painted white.
Floor is covered with linoleum. The physician is Dr. P.G.Eilers,
who is in charge of the hospital. Miss Mary E. Dennis, formerly
field matron at San Felipe but now hospital matron, is at his left.
The patient on the table is Francisco Casquito, a Jemez Indian, who
sustained severe burns of the face and eyes. Had it not been for
the efficient treatment this man received at the hospital his eye
sight would have been lost.
