diet, some times a change of work, some times rest and frequently, a
glass ofmilk in the middle of the fo renoon and another in the mid
dle of the afternoon.
The food has been sufficient in quantity, well cooked and
at tractive. Sufficient vegetables were furnished during a large
share of the year but during the latter part of the winter, and
early spring, a lɛrge variety of vegetables and green- stuft has
not been supplied. Po ta toes have been furnished throughout the school
year and we have had a good supply of dried and canned fruits and some
vegetables.
An endeavor has been made to have the bakery department furnish
something extra once a day for instance, pie, cake, ginger bread, hot
rolls, etc.
About 12 pints of milk per pupil has been supplied the school
during the year. The dairy has improved and is under better supervision
than here to fore. It is believed that our supply will provide at least
1š pints per pupil during the next schoal year.

Every child has participated in cales thenics or a thletics unless
excused by the physician. These exercises are super vi sed by the a thl e
tic director. When weather permitted, the exercises took place in open
air, at other times in a large and well ventilated gymnasium. The foot
bali, basketball, baseball, and track teams have represen ted the school
with credit.
The housing of pupils in the three dormitories and sleeping porch
additions has been satisfactory. Adjoining the sleeping porches are
steam- heated rooms used for study and dressing purposes. I regret to
have to say that employees are not as well housed as are the pupils.
