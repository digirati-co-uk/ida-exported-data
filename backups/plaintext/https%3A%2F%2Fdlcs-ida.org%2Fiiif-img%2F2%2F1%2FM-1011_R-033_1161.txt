- 2-ANNUAL REPORT,1929.SCHOOLS,Cont'a.NARRATIVE SECTION.EASTERN NAVAJO JURISDICTION.The Rehoboth school, operated by the Christian Reformed Church,has been doing very creditable work up to and including eighth grade.The Farmington Methodist Boarding School is also a school of high standing tho their work was interferred with in early spring on account ofa lire which destroyed the Refectory and Dining Hall. The advancedpupils were allowed to go home for a time, but they rebuilt and arenow ready for an early enrollment of their former children.The Eastern Navajo Boarding School enrolls many new beginnerseach year and tries to put them thru the sixth grade, but this is notalways possible on account of the requirements of having to transferto the non- reservation schools, these being replaced by new ones fromthe Indian country. Text books and course of study as now followedseem to be very well fitted to the Indian pupil. Boys receive instruction in farming, gardening, construction, health, livestock industry,while the girls receive home training, cooking, laundering, sewing anaweaving.Our school is very much in need of a home economics building, aswe cannot provide suitable quarters for the industries properly comingwithin the scope of this training.Employees in the main have been interested in the welfare and advancement of the Indian student, and have given their best endeavor toadvance them in the work. The schools for the Indian people must besuch as to educate the Indians with the whole purpose of fitting themfor complete independence and such instruction given as will fit themfor some special profession or trade.The playground equipment in use consists only of swings and shouldbe added to as fast as funds are available for this purpose. Supervision of playground activities and games has been given.This is a semi- arid country, the livestock industry is the maindependence for a livelihood, both by whites and Indians, but it has beenvery emphatically demonstrated that they cannot occupy the same rangeor country and for that reason it will be many years before the Government can place them in position for the Indians to establish and maintain their own schools.
