d. There are times of the year here when the Indians
do not work as they should for the do not see the need of
building fences, homes, etc., in winter time and when
the crops are harvested, as the white man does. We are
after them all the time about this. Our influence is
bearing fruit and more permanent homes is noticeable
among the Navajos.
The Navajos make excellent shovel men and teamsters.
They are poorly adapted to cotton picting. They are fine
in the woods as swampers, eto. They make poor mill hands
on inside work. The Hopis like cotton picking and if they
take their families and all work, can make fine wages at
it. The Hopis are liked better than any other help in
the Salt River Valley and elsewhere. They are very
dependable people, industrious without a boss as they are
with one. They are good workers no matter where they
work or the nature of the work.
