The ton. Comissioner of Indian Affairs,
Washington, D. C.
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of office letter 0
Dec. 7-( Finance 52297 98) in answer to my request for authority to
expand$ 70 for 1500 feet of drop siding for the Cow Barn. 1500
The only
explanation that I am abie to give is that the" barn" in question
stands here untinished.
It is boardet uend down with common IxI2
bare very poor ones at that) and not oatien edo
The only lumber here when I wok charge of the school was a few
Ix12 boards which I was compelled to use as shelving in the warehouse,
The lumber dealer strongly meintains that the siding in question was
Gevared and taken from the yard by the sc200 ans.
I again renew may request for the authority to expand$ 70 in the
purchase of 3600 fees of drop- viding to be used in residing? the cow
bar.
l'he necessity for this is shown from the following facts. Ist: The
0923), 23 it is, is useless, so much so that the cows are now kept in
che herse barn much to the inconvenience of the Industrial Teacher end
