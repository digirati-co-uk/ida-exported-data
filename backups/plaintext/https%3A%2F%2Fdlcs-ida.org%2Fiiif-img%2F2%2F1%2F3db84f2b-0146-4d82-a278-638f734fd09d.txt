Schools.9.it is now the only Government Indian School in Michigan, sincethe Bay Mills Day School was closed June 30th of this year. Wedo not go outside of the state to fill this school and areunable to accommodate the number of needy Indian children who seekadmission.The relations between the city public schools and thisschool are most amiable. Since the new course of study foruse in the United States Indian Schools has been adoptedthe state course of study, formerly in use here, will bediscontinued. The industrial training given for girls and boysin this school in the prevocational division is obligatory andis arranged so as to have each boy and girl take those courseswhich will qualify him or her, to do the every day work ofa rural hondand to secure an elemental and practical knowledgeof those industries which are necessary in the maintainance ofthe home and in the proper support of the family. The new courseof study requires a great deal of thought and study in order todetail the pupils for the industrial work in the prevocationaldivision in such a way that they will receive the exact amountof time required for each subject, but we hope to hea* e anoutline which will actually work out by the time school startsSin September.Our girls' home is crowded, as both large and scall girls150 in all, are quartered in the same building. The presentbuilding should be used for the large girls only. A new buildingis urgently needed for the small girls in order that they mayLargÂº-be separated from the sent 14 girls and receive more individualcare and attention.
