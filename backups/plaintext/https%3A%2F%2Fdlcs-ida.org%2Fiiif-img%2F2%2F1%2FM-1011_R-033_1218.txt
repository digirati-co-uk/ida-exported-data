8.HEALTH.1930:NARRATIVE S$ CTION.EASTERN NAVAJO JURISDICTION.The health in general of the school and reservation has been verygood during the past year with the exception of an epidemic of themeasles and numerous deaths on the reservation were due to impropercare and lack of medical attention and death usually occurred frompneumonia complications. Our situation is now somewhat relieved as wenow have a regular physician to take charge of the improvised hospitaland we are endeavoring to secure the services of another physician,who can qualify unded the Civil Service requirements, his work to belargely in the field. The impe taga condition, which was prevalentlast year, is practically cleared up. Quite a number of tubepoulosispatients were sent either to Laguna or Ft. Defiance, which is a longways from where most of our Indians live and Indians in the Star Lakeand Kimebeto country desire that a small sanatorium be placed somewherewithin the area where they live that it might be more assessable, withthe possibility of a better patronage than sanatoriums so far removedfrom their homes. The necessity for a hospital is now before theIndian Department and it is quite probable that 1932 will see an appropriation made by Congress especially for general hospital facilities in this Jurisdiction. The construction of the proposed hospitalhere at this Agency is contingent on the development of more water.There is still considerable eye trouble, especially among theisolated Indians, and it seems to require a ground floor campaignfrom hogan to hogan in order to find all the cases that need attentionand this should be done under direction of some trachoma specialist.In the past our hospital facilities have not been ample for theneeds. of the school let alone for reservation Indians.Venereal disease is prevalent and whenever& case is foundthey are brought in for hospital treatment, tho some cases get tobe serious before we learn of them. Dr. Pousma of the Rehoboth Mission hospital has made a number of blood tests which have been giventhe Wasserman test, with the result that about one adult in sevenshow a positive syphilitic condition, and should this ratio existover the entire reservation it certainly is an alarming situation.A copy of his report has been mailed your office and deserves morethan passing attention.The agency physician has given treatment to a number of casesof ghonorrhea, but has made no blood tests to determine the presenceof syphilitic germs and has not administered neo- salvarsan treatment.More physicians, as hereinbefore mentioned and such other personnelnecessary to keep in close touch with all of the adult Indians, isthe only solution in the promotion of a better health situation.The Indians live over a large scattered area and there are but fewplaces that field matrons could work to advantage.
