41- HopiWELFARE AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS:We have no social service agent and need one badly.At present we have to reach our Indians and their homes throughthe field nurses and field matrons, who do a great deal of suchwork and help very much in promulgating and carrying out plansand programs for better village sanitation and home conditions.A most conspicious and encouraging result the pastyear has been home building. This year we will increase ourefforts along this line, bettering home conditions in every waywe can. While we aim to improve conditions progressively, weare always continually confronted with the handicaps of havingno reservation laws governing misdemeanors or marriages. If wecould get state laws extended over the reservation it wouldImprove home conditions inmediately. Without such laws we arelosing a great deal of time, making slow headway, encounteringserious difficulties, which are very discouraging to the personnel.Family and home conditions will always be bad without such laws tosupport programs for better conditions.Our Law and Order program for 1932 will be the same asthat for the past fiscal year-- judges and headmen in districts- anda monthly business council of Indians at the agency. The NavajoCouncil will always be a wonderful help to any superintendent andtakes great interest in its work, assisting in many ways for betterlaw and order among its people. I do not hesitate to say it functionsentirely in the interest of better people, better conditions and infurthering the policies of the Coromissioner and Indian Office. Ifthe Hopis could only get and operate such a Council their Tribalaffairs would be handled in a much more satisfactory and progressivemanner-- but the Hopis can not get together or work together, whichmakes it very hard to either assist them or lead ther.Respectfully suvuitted,MillerEdgar K.
