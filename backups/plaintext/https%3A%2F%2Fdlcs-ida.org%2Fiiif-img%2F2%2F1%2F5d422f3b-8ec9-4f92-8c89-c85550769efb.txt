It is voy evident from the fact that wbuilt a Hogan,
that we had a great deal of Construction work. It consisted
of acting as stone mason, digging ditches, plastering, and
all the various kinds of work connected with building and
decorating a Hogan. The children were usually allowed to
choose their work. Most of them tried to help with nearly
every kind of work we did. I tried to impress the importance
of doing well any kind of work they did. So many would do
their work carelessly. I believe there was some improvement
in their desire to do neat, careful work.
I tried to stress health and cleanliness.
Every
possible opportunity for development along that line was
given careful consideration. Of course there were many
opportunities and advantages for teaching it in a natural way,
being in a hogan we had similiar situations to those found
in their homes.
Usually about one- fourth of the day was spent on
reading and literature. Whenever possible it was connected
with their other work. They were given books according to
their level and abilities. We read and enjoyed many poems
and stories. I also had them try to do some original work
in writing stories and poems.
Our number work was connected with the Unit wherever
possible. There was a need for much drill work.
I feel
that was one place we failed to do as much as we should.
They did not rate as high in the Achievement Test as they
would have done with more drill work.
