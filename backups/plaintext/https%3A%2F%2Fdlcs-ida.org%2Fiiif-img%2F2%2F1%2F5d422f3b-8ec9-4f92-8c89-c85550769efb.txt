It is voy evident from the fact that wbuilt a Hogan,that we had a great deal of Construction work. It consistedof acting as stone mason, digging ditches, plastering, andall the various kinds of work connected with building anddecorating a Hogan. The children were usually allowed tochoose their work. Most of them tried to help with nearlyevery kind of work we did. I tried to impress the importanceof doing well any kind of work they did. So many would dotheir work carelessly. I believe there was some improvementin their desire to do neat, careful work.I tried to stress health and cleanliness.Everypossible opportunity for development along that line wasgiven careful consideration. Of course there were manyopportunities and advantages for teaching it in a natural way,being in a hogan we had similiar situations to those foundin their homes.Usually about one- fourth of the day was spent onreading and literature. Whenever possible it was connectedwith their other work. They were given books according totheir level and abilities. We read and enjoyed many poemsand stories. I also had them try to do some original workin writing stories and poems.Our number work was connected with the Unit whereverpossible. There was a need for much drill work.I feelthat was one place we failed to do as much as we should.They did not rate as high in the Achievement Test as theywould have done with more drill work.
