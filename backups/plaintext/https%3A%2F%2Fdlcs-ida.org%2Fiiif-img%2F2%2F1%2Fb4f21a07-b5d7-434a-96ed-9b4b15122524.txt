I have the honor to request that I be authorized to expend
$ 59.00 in the open market purchase of;.
6 cast iron stancions, at$ 4,33 1/3 wach,
1 grate for fire box,
2 cast iron doors and frames, at$ 6.00 each,
6 rods, 1 inch by 14 feet, at$ 2.50 each,
6,00
12.00
15.00
$ 59,00
- all required for immediate use in constructing a bake oven ad
joining the bakery building..
The sheet- iron bake oven that has
been in use tous far has not sufficient capacity to bake for the
school.
This is not to be a separate building, and there lore
I believe it can be constructed under the head of repairs.
Very respectfully,
Cash
Superintendente
