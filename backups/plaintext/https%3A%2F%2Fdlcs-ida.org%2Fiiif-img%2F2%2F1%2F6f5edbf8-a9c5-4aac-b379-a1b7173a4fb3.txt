I have the honor to advise you that it seems best to me
to reduce my last estinate for stapp.tos as follows;
Bacon, 1000 pormd, is( the entire quantity estimated for),
dornmeal 5000 108
all other articles should be reduced one fifth, except horse
feed( corn, Peed and cats), which should not be reduced:
also the following reductions may be made in the annual estimate
of goods for the fiscal year 1893 and there will remain sufficient
quantities of the se articles to supply the number of children that
will be in the school;
