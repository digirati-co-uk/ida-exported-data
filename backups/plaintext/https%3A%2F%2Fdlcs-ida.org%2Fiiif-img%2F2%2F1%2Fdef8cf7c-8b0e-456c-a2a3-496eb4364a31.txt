SCIENCE OLYMPIAD

Science Olympiad is a
competition that tests students'
knowledge in the areas of
biology, engineering, physics,
and chemistry. Schools from
all over New Mexico vie to
place first, second, or third in
events such as Bungee- Egg
Drop, Bio- Process Lab, and
Bottle Rocket. To get ready
for the competition, students
research science books and
build models and machines that
must perform various tasks.
Science Olympiad
started here at Santa Fe Indian
School as a project within the
Gifted and Talented program.
Later, it came to include the
entire mid- school as well as
the entire high school. For the
past five years, SFIS has made
it to the state competition in
Socorro at New Mexico Tech.
This year we didn' t fair as well,
but we hope to rebound next
year.
