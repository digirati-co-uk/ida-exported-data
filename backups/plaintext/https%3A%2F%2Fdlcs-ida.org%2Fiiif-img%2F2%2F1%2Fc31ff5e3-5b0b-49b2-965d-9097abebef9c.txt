2where wat er in sufficient quantity for school purpos s can be found.The buildings with some slight alterations will comfortablyaccomodate about 75 pupils.I recommend that it be establishedwithout delay.Unnecessary expense was incurred in the organization of the Albuquerque and Grand Junction Schools by sending omployes long before supplies were received.The supplies shouldbe shipped and when they reach Holbrook the Superintendent shouldbe sent.It will then require several weeks to haul supplies,( 175 miles) set up desks and complete preparations for the reception of pupils.In addition to the ordinary employes a good carpenter andblacksmith who is also a wheelwright, should also be authorized.Neglect of Industrial training is one of the causes of thefailure of the Navajo School.This should be avoided in the organization of this school.The success of the school will depend upon the character ofthe employes.The teachers especially should be familiar withthe best methods of primary instruction, and none but teachers ofexperience should be selected.-o- 000Respectfully submitted,819, Indian Division,RitchFebruary 11, 1887.Chief Indian Division.
