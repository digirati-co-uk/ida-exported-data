The
Past
to
These early years were not the
proudest. Children from
Native American tribes
throughout the US were
brought to the Indian School
in order to change their way of
life to assimilate them.
Stories of hardship and
sadness remain at the
foundation of the boarding
school.
Agricultural fields were kept on the campus
These fields were tended by the students.
Home economics was a critical part of the
curriculum for female students.
The purpose of the Indian
School was to eradicate
everything about the students-
language, customs, family, and
even clothes. The new way of
life was brand new. English,
military uniforms and marching
were used to create" new"
members of society.
