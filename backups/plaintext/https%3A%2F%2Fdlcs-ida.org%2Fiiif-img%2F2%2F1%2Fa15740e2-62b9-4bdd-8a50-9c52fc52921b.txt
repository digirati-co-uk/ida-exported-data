MDKAREAGE OF MReport---- 2The day school recently opened at the Cornfields with an enrolAUG 23 1910ment of twenty four and an average attendance of twenty two 18 doingexcellent work and I believe it will be a success.The Mission School located at St. Michaels nine miles fromFort Defiance and conducted by the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrement,is doing excellent work.The Navajo Indians are all self supporting with the exceptionof about seventy five who are too old and helpless to do any work.The se few receive rations at the Agency once a week,The principal industries of the Indians on this reservation arestock saising and blanket weaving. They own in the aggregate eighthundred, sheep and goats and a great number of cattas and horses.They derive a large income by the sale of their wool, pelts, silverware and their famous blanket s.The Navajos are not a agricultural people, although every familycultivates a patch of ground where they grow corn, squash, melons etc.This is irrigated principally by flood water of melted snow in themountains which pours down through the arroyos and spreads out overtheir fields.A great deal of credit is due the se people. They have lived undergreat disadvantages fighting nature step by step for their living, andsucceeding in anmassing a great amount of wealth.Respectfully yours,Superintendent.
