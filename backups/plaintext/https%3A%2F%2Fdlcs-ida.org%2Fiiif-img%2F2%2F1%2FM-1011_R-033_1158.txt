ANNUAL REPORT,1929.NARRATIVESECTIONHEATIV.EASTERI NAVAJO JURISDICTIONThe general health of the school was very good except for anepidemic of flu, tho of rather a mild form. Among the reservationIndians it was more severe, due perhaps to the method of medicineman practice. Impetaga has been very much aggravated and specialeffort made by physician to give treatment in every case found.This situation is improved.Tuberculosis is prevalent but every case found is taken toFort Defiance or Laguna Sanitoriums, tho in the case of some students who return from non- reservation schools with incipient stagealmost without exception they improve and recover when returned tothe reservation. Thru the organization of chapters in various Indian localities, we are hopeful that their interest in better homeswill be promoted each year more emphatically and that more and better homes will result,At present our greatest need is at least a 60 bed hospitalwith ample personnel, nurses, another physician, that he may givemost of his time visiting the Indians in their homes and bringingto hospital all cases needing hospital or surgical treatment.Another physician should be placed at Farmington or in Kinebetocountry; a third in the Torreone country, sixty miles northeast ofAgency; and, a fourth at Laguna with his work to be among the Canoncitoand Pu√©rticito bands of Havajos, and another physician to be placedat Ramah, or Two Wells, and his territory to be among those Indianssouth of the Santa Fe Railroad, each to have a small first aid hospital and dispensary, and the more serious cases to be brought tothe base hospital at Crownpoint, tho at this time we have only animprovised hospital of 32 beds, which at times is not large enoughfor the care of school children. Medical Supervisor Dr. Warner hasrecommended that an appropriation be given this jurisdiction for theconstruction of a hospital, quarters and equipment, of$ 75,000.00and should receive und ivided support in justification by the officeas this is very urgent indeed if our health situation is to be verymaterially improved.Much trachoma is still prevalent, particularly among those wholive in remote sections of the country, tho numerous cases have beenbrought in for operation and treatment, but with physicians locatedas above mentioned it would be possible to give the situation intensive attention, and should be considered one of the greatest dutiesto be attended to by the Department. In the isolated country tenthospitals could be established where Indians could be treated fortrachoma or other infectious diseases, tho with additional physicianslocated at the most favorable places among the Indians, perhaps a thorough campaign could be instituted and carried out until all personssuffering from such disease would receive beneficial treatment.
