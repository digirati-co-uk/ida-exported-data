termined their industries. Subsistence farming must needbe associated with other occupations for otherwise itleaves too much time for idleness. In the dim past withthe Pueblos, hunting, weaving, basketry, pottery, painting,trade, etc. had their place. Their basketsBirth ofand pottery were necessitated by theCraftsproducts of their fields and garden, andtheir difficulty in obtaining wild game innumber to supply raiment prompted them toresort to weaving for their clothing andblankets.

An acre of corn cultivated as they could and maybedid, might produce 1000 to 5000 pounds, the larger amountsubsistence for a family of five for perhaps two years.Three to four acres in favorable years could have promisedthe seven years subsistence for the average family.
