read
Indian Office letter dated October 4, 1917 roceived,
inviting to my attention that the Narrative Section and Census
for the fiscal year 1917, that should have been in the Indian
Office by July i, 1917, have not been received. My attention
18 called to my statements in letters of August that
11/26
just as soon as the Narrative Report may be
diotated and the corrected sensus placed in the
hands of a copyist, every effort will be made to file
these belated reports."
The direction is given that these reports MUST be submitted not
later than November 10, 1917.
I wish to respectfully point out that my August report as to
the reasons for delay in the matter of many important reports,
remains unchanged today. The Indian Office has not improved
the conditions in my office, and I have been unable to improve
such conditions through the employment of temporary clerks.
This Moqui Agency has the heaviest office work of any of the
Navajo reservations.
The records of the Indian Office with respect to employes
will show that the Moqui Stenographer position became vacant
before June 30, 1917, and that the Assistant Clerk resigned
on July 2, 1917. Since that time there has been at my disposal
but one clerk, a new man( although very competent) and this one
man has been entirely occupied with the close of the 1917 cash
accounts, under the old system, and the installation of the new
& ccounting system.
The Superintendent of a reservation so large as Moqui, having
five schools, to say nothing of the stock and range work, the
field ma trons and physicians( and to say nothing more of a measles
epidemic and a smallpor infection), should not be expected to
labor as a combined clerk and stenographor, if the Indian business
is to be conducted properly. Yet the routine work of this
roservation has beqı kopt up properly. I do not suppose that
the Statistical Division of the 011ico 18 titally concerned in
the work of schools, stockmen, police, field ma trons, physicians,
dancos, law and order, liquor, courts, fairs, and the attention
that must be shown to supervising officials. But as Superintendent
I have to be interested in these things.
I list below the various matters that have had attention when
I have not been hammering a typewriter as a stenographer and typist.
