These last fours years have
gone too fast. I started and
worked my way up the ladder
with my classmates. And I say
now to all underclassmen, keep
going on that road in school. I' ll
miss all of you, and I' ll always
remember ya' ll. I' d like to
thank my teachers, and family
for helping me through my
struggles. To my class, we' re
finally going to exit the paolo
soleri gates and go on into the
world. So I guess I' ll take my
bag and go. “ See ya up the
road. ”
