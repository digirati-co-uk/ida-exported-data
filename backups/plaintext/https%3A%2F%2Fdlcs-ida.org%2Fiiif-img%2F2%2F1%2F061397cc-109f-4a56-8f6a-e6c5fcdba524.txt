The buildings of this school are mostly good substantial buil
dings, some of them need quite a number of repairs; they are not
large enough to accommodate the number of pupils now in attendance;
the children are badly crowded, in the boys dormitory especially.
The capacity of the school is 120. pupils, there now enrolled
175. Sanitary condition, good.
The buildings are all heated by stoves, and lighted by oil lamps.
The buildings and their condition are as follows:
Boys' building etc.
A good stone building in bad repair, the roof leaks in a number
of places which has caused the plastering to fall off in most of
the rooms, there are some other repairs that should be made, the
agent should receive authority to make the repairs required at once,
I think a new tin or iron roof is needed.
Girls' building.
A good two story stone building in good repair except in the
dormitories where large pieces of plastering has fallen off caused
by the roof leaking, it should be repaired during vacation.
Dining hall.
A good two story stone building on good general repair, the plas
tering has fallen off in some of the rooms, the roof in the past has
leaked, but it is said to be in good condition at the present time.
Laundry.
A good one story frame building in good repair, it is not large
enough.
Chapel and class room.
A good one story stone building in good repair, it was formerly
the agency office and commisary.
