OFFICEOFINDIAN6-1142UNITED STATESADEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIORStatisticsH- CINDIAN FIELD SERVICEJicarilla Indian Agency,Dulce, New Mexico,Aug. 23, 1929AUG271929RECEIVEDCommissioner of Indian Affairs,Washington, D. C.SHIVAAYDear Sir:Replying to Office letter of July 27th, 1929 and Officecollect telegram relative thereto, there is transmitted herewith in duplicate a revised sheet covering the cost of medicalservice, pro rating costs as nearly as can be determined.In this connection I would especially mention that thetelegram also called for the submission of the May monthlyreport for the hospital here,The required report was mailed your Office June 8, 1929,along with other reports.,Relative to the revised cost sheet enclosed, our originalfigures followed the expenditures for the different activitiesaccording to specific appropriations, the figures being takendirectly from the records. In pro- rating the physician'ssalary our original figures are necessarily altered so they donot show the actual expenditures from the appropriations forthe activities involved.It is further explained that since July 13th we have beenvery seriously handicapped in our work. The financial clerk wascalled away on that date because of the severe illness of his wifein California; the Junior Clerk resigned July 20th. The Officewill therefore see that the work now devolv√∂ng upon the singleclerk left on duty, is quite heavy. We are doing the best we canunder the circumstances, but it is almost inevitable that someof the details will be overlooked or delayed. We are still thushampered in our work, and will doubtless continue to be untilthe vacancies exisiting at the present time have been filled andthe new clerks have gained sufficient experience to performsatisfactorily the many involved duties at this agency.Very respectfully,GenresB- encl.C.A.Gossett.Superintendent.
