Annual ReportLaw& Order- 4Santa FeSchoolby selection of members of their own pueblos, subject to ourapproval, for appointment as deputies or police to combat theliquor traffic and protect their lands from trespass. The seare pueblos which are the most closely associated with neighboring Mexi can settlers and who have to quite an extent inter.married with the Mexicans. They have been influenced in thestand they have taken, I believe, by the counsel of the ir Mexican neighbors. It is unfortunate that they have been subject.ed to such influence and advice, which is based upon ulteriormotives, but it is a contingency which cannot be avoided, andwhich I would not be inclined to remedy if I could, believingthat the time has come in the conduct of Indian affairs whenthe Indian must weigh advice and counsel given him, and choosefor himself between that which is sound and for his good, andthat which is prompted by selfish motivesIt is proposed to establish police or deputies, or both,where conditions warrant, in the pueblos in this districtand reconmendationssetting forth the reasons and necessityfor such action will be submitted. In pueblos where by reasonof reactionary tendencies, as at Santo Domingo, or a desirefor non- interference by the government with the liquor trafficas at San Ildefonso, Tesuque and Nambe, the pueblos will notcooperate with the government in the protection of their moraland material welfare by the selection of men to act as police,or where such Indians cannot be secured to act in that capacitywithout the sanction of pueblo officials, subsequent recommenda.tion will be made to provide for the contingency, in the appointment of outside men, either Indian or whiteJemez is the only pueblo in this district which manufactures a native drink. At Jene z, as at Isleta in the Albuquerquedistrict, the Indians have extensive vineyards and a considerable quantity of wine is made, which is consumed by the Ind iansand is followed throughtherwinterby the usual attendant disordersof drunkenness, brawls and domestictroubles, The Jemez Indianshave been informed in council that the making of wine will notbe permitted, and that where their grape 3 are converted intowine the wine will be confiscated.The Jemez Indians do not closely associate, and have not toany extenttheintermarriedwithundesirableMexicanpopulation
