Rainy generally in July and August but therehas been no rain of great practical value in this valley to date sincemy arrival April 25th of this year.There are no allotments,From my observation ten acres will cover all the land on this reservation cultivated by Indians including gardens, A number of Indians ooccupying selections along temporary streams have expended a good dealof labor trying to get enough water to make small gardens but their efforts have been almost unavailing on account of lack of water. I haveseen as many as half a dozen gardens begun by them and perish for llackof water. There was an unusually light fall of snow last winter in themountains and these streams affording in average years enough water forcorn and early vegetables absolutely failed this season.The area cultivated this year is less than usual on account of thelack of water.The only crops attempted have been corn, melons and beans.There is no market nearer than Cortez, nineteen miles away and thisvery local and uncertain. The Cortez market is supplied fully by theneighboring ranchers.Water is the only solution. All these Indians need to make them ina few years small farmers, is water. The conditions of their life andcountry are such that they will never be more than small farmers andstock raisers in addition,mell
