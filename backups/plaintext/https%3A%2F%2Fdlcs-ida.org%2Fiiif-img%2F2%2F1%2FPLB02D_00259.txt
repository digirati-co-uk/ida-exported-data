None as far as we could find out.Q.Well wouldit becorrect tosummarize yourtestimonyon this point by saying that as faras you could ascertain theentire irrigation of the land given to the settlers at SantaClara was due to the efforts of the non- Indiansor their predecessor sA. Yes, that would be correct.Q. And did you consider this fact a proper subject of de.luctio! as an" oveme on- I,ans theland?A. Yes,Agood many of the deeds examined by the Board wereold deeds, and it would be correctto say thatas a generalthinwhe 1e non- Indian claimants produced eir deedsthe chain of title under them ran back 40 or 50 years, and wetook that as slowing that the Indian possession ceased asearly a e date of he earliest deed and ereforesubsequent improvement of the land was made by the settlers. The Indian cultivation at present is centered aroundand in the vicinity of the Pueblo, and that is true as far backas we could obtain any information, and we could not findfrom the records and the testimony that the Indian cultivation had extended much beyond the present general area cultivated by the Indians, which isto the south and east of thePueblo and toenor of the Pueblo as far as 1e SantaClara creek, except that at one time there may have been asmall strip of what is now within the Guachapangue nonIndian area thatmay in the distant past have beencultivatedby the Indians, but the area north and in and around Espa.Ã±ola has never been cultivated by the Indians, and we took thatas an indication that the bulk of the land acquired by the settlers was unimproved when they acquired it, but there aresome non- Indian claims withinwhat might be called the In.dian area, near tire outhern boundary of the grant on thewest side ot the road, sume of clairs have been extinguished and some unexinguished, and this area was probablymore recently3 rupied by the non- Indians than any other
