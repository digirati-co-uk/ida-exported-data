San Juan School
and Agency
I am of the opinion
that such influence
as the older Indians
and medicine
men might exert, would not prove to be a serious
handicap
in the hospital
work of this reservation
.
All that it has been practicable
to do with our limited
force and resources
has been done in connection
with the general
campaign
throughout
the service for the conservation
of the
health of the Indians
and the reduction
of infant mortality
.
Until
such time as the Indians
can be located
in permanent
homes, I can see no advantages
that would accrue from the
employment
of field matrons.
