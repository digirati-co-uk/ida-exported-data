11-2.AGENCY.The buildings at the Agency, including the Hospital, arewell constructed and comfortable, but badly in need of repairs.Two new Employees cottages should be constructed immediately at a cost of$ 4,000,00 each. The greater part of the stonework can be done by Hopi Indians. The Hospital should beenl er ged, and a specific apportionment of funds made for itsmaintenance.A residence should be constructed adjoining the Hospitalfor the surgeon in charge, to cost approximately$ 3,500.00.Funds have already been provided for repairing water worksand developing the water supply.The re appears to have been much trouble with the NavajoIndi ans on this reservation in the past; in fact when I tookcharge they were very averse to coming to the Agency office,and when they did come they were heavily armed, prepared forany eventuality. I am bound to think this bad condition andattitude of the Navajo towards this office was due to unwiseaction of Government representatives and inexperience inhandling Indians.I could not wish a more friendly attitude than that nowexisting between the Navajos and this office and employees.One or two outlaws have been apprehended and sent to thepenitentiary, but with this exception it has not been necessaryto arrest or punish a single Navajo. I do not see why thereshould have been so much trouble with them in the past.I think the Hopis at Hotevilla would be ugly if they hadthe courage; they are the most unreasonable Indians on thereservation. It was necessary recently to surround the villageat 2:30 A.M. and take their children by force to prevent themfrom being run off and hidden away.There is and has been for quite a long time devilment brewingbe tween the Moenkapis of Western Navajo reservation and theHote villa Hopis on this reservation, but no open break so far.When it comes, if it ever does, I shall handle it withoutoutside assistance.
