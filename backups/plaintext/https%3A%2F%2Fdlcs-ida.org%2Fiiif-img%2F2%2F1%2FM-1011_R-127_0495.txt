Annual ReportSchools- 5Santa Feenroll at the Santa Fe Industrial school or St. Catherine Missionschool. At the Santo Domingo pueblo there is urgent need of aday school, as only about fifty of the children of school age,out of more than two hundred, are in a ttendance at the San ta FeIndustrial schoo The other pueblos alluded to are so smallthat the government would not be justified in establishing dayschools, and most, if not all, the children are taken care of inthe San ta Fe and St. Catherine' s schools.The state course of study in New Mexico is similar to thecourses of study in other states, and is followed so far as it canbe adapted to the needs of the Indian schoolOne of the principal features of the Santa Fe school is thestress laid on industrial training. Especial care is exercisedin giving the boys instruction in gardening, farming, care of orchards, dairying, care and handling of stock, as well as the usualinstruction in the trades that can be taught at an Indian school,The garden and orchard are well cared for, and beside fur.nishing vegetables for the pupils' tables during the summer, thegarden produces sufficient quantities of onions, cabbages, beets,carrots, parsnips and squash to last the entire school year Thesevegetables, with the subsistence supplies allowed on the annual estimate, and the products from the dairy and poultry yard, make itpossible to have an excellent bill of fare for the pupils' tablesduring the entire year. The orchard this year again will furnishan abundance of apples, peaches,pears, plums and apricots, and itis the intention to preserve many barrels of fruit for the winters eason. A class of girls have planted and taken care of a nicegarden in which a good part of the school' s vegetables are raisedThe girls are taught all kinds of domestic work, and are given sometraining in the hospital- all with a view to preparing the m forfuture usefulness in improving their home surroundings and conum unities when they return to their homes.The most imperative need of the school is an additi on to thegirls' dormitory. At present the school is obliged, for lack ofroon, to turn away many girls who seek admittance. A sul table ad.dition which would accomodate fifty girls more, and furnish manyneeded conveniences for the girls who are already here, would costabout$ 20, 000. The office, I believe, understands this need, andit is hoped that steps will be taken to obta in this addition atthe earliest practicable date
