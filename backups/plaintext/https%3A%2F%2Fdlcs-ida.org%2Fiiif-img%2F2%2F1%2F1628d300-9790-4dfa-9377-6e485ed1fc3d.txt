Industries- 31.
At best the product is& ourio or fad and the demand is
very limited.
It is very fragile and the loss in ship
ping is very great.
I believe our endeavors should be
directed to making these Indians able to make a good
living under the condition existing in the Southwest, and
to do this we will do well to hold up as an example the
white settlers who have come here and achieved a competence.
In no case, however, have I observed the women of the
white settlers making pottery. It might be profitable
for a very few Indians to continue making pottery, but as
an industry for the whole tribe it is a waste of time.
Not more than ten cents per day could be earned from it
as a regular occupation.
Almost the same might be said of the basket industry.
The experiment of having Navajo women devote all their
time to the weaving of blankets with the object of
determining their earning capacity was tried by Mr. S.E.
Aldrich, of Gallup, New Mexico, with the result that
thirty cents per day was found to be the average wage
received.
Since the Navajo blanket is the most useful
of exclusively Indian products, and the one for which
there is the greatest demand, it is needless to point out
the fallacy of pottery and baske try as profitable indus
tries.
