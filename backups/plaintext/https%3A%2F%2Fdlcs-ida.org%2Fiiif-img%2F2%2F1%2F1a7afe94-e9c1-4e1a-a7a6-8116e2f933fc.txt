OHopi 18.d. It would be unwise to advise these Indians to purchase or try to keep dairy cows.14. There are other industries such as farming, gardening,fruit raising, basket and pottery making and blanket andshawl weaving, freighting, eto., which are continuallyincreasing in importance among these people and makingthem better off.15. The work of returned students is fine in many casesand they are fine workers as a usual thing. The Hopis,especially, make fine employees, both willing toplease and industrious.16. We have no farmers or industrial teachers among theseIndians. We have but one stockman. This is a sad mistake.We should have several of these men going among theseIndians, the better sort, encouraging proper fencing,ranging, corralling, eto.17. No education is being given these people by farmersexcepting by the one farmer at the Navajo Boarding School.We have no industrial organization among these Indians.b. We are too far from the railroad for much agriculturalwork, excepting as the Indians needs are concerned.18.I suggest that we get some man who is in touch withthe efforts of the Government to get desert plants forgrowing in this country; some plants that we can growwithout water, which will be good for the Indians to handleand which will furnish forage for stook. This would helpmake permanent homes among the Navajos and allow for thegrading up of the flocks and herds. These Indians wouldgrow such crops if they could get the seed and thebarbed wire for fencing. What we want is something thatwill grow in this country. W are trying several new plantsthis year in a two- acre plot, but with poor success.19. The trading posts of this reserve take everythingthe Indians will have for sale and at good prices. Thereis nothing the Indians want to sell they can not sell atthese places. Good prices, somehow, are always maintained.Our traders are an exceptinally good class of men.They are always willing to help the Indians and even purchaseseed and stock and give to the Indians at times.20. No saw mill is operated here. W. have no merchantabletimber on the reserve, but plenty of wood for camp fires.
