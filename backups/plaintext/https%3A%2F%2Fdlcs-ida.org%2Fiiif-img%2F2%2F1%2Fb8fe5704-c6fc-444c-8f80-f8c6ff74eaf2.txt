CROS
IN LOVING MEMORY OF ROCKY ROBINSON
I saw you in a dream once.
You sat next to an empty chair in front of the dorm.
It was put there for me. We sat talking about the things that washed
away my happiness, and the reasons why you stayed at SFIS, while
your family was in California. You told me, “ I chose to stay
because I care, I chose to stay because I' m needed here, the same
way you will soon be needed. ”
