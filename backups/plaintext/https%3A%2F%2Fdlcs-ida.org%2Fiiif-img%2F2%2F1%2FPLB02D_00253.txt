No.Q. Now after gettingthat far howdid theBoard proceed to estimate the deductionto be madefor improvementsin the land by the settlers,and how did you arriveat the losssustained by theIndiansas shownby the final column?A. In replyto your question, I would say that ina general way the Board, after a great deal of consideration ofthe matter, arrived at theconclusion that the method pursued was a fair and equitable method of arrivingat thelossto the Indiansunder the wording of the Act.That isto say,that the Board decided totake as a basis abasic value of$ 35 an acre and to award to the Indians as damagesthe fullvalue from$ 35 down, and for lands classifiedas of a greatervalue per acre than$ 35, toaward to the Indians as damagesa maximum of$ 35 an acre, onthe basis that in spite of thefact that perhaps at the time of the transfer of thelandsfrom the Indians to the non- Indians, which, in almosteverycase was more than 40 years ago, a reasonable value of theland, with such water as might have been attached to it, wasaround$ 25an acre; we believedthat we were acting liberally,in makingtiis basic estimateof vaiuations$ 35,an acre, or$ 10 over the$ 25 an acre, whichwe believedwas a fair estimate of the value around 40years ago.Q. Referring again to the table here, here are values from$ 30 down and from$ 30 up, is it correctto say that from$ 30down your awardgive the Indiansthe fullpreseut marketvalue as show a by the appraisalA.
