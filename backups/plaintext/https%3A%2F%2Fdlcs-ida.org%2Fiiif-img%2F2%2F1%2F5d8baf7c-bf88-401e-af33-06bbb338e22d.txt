Section 111............... Continued................... School
During the year there were fifteen deserters, six of these returned.
Boys in higher grades who desert, have been denied the privilege of re
enrolling. It is believed they should not be re- enrolled when they
fail to show some appreciation of the opportunities offered and fail to
set a good example. Two boys were dismissed for detestable pzactices.
The teaching force in the academic department headed by Mrs. Isis
Harrington, principal, is efficient, loyal, and their cooperation with
each other is excellent. This is generally true of the industrial and
domestic teachers and employees.
The grading of pupils of the school was as follows:
