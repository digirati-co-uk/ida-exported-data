Pueblo Day Schools at Santa Fe, N.M.
The health conditions aro far from satisfactory
in the Puoblos. Trachoma provails to a greater or 1088
extent in all of them, and the projudico on the part of the
Indians to submit to treatment by the physicians naturally
retards marked progress in the treatment of the disease,
however, some progress is being mado, and as the efforts
being put forth in combating the disease will not be relaxed,
it is to be expocted that more success will be obtained in
future as the Indians come to see the benefits of the treatment,
The physicians and all who have to fight this diseas–æ her.
have much to contend with, but they aro making earnost afforts
to overcomo the prejudice of the Indians.
Tuberculosis is found to a comparatively small
thero
extent in the Pueblos, some physicians question whether, is any
but it seems to be pretty well established that there are some
cases of this disease among these Indians.
It has been less than a year since physicians have
been assigned regularly to these Pueblos, and there is no data
showing what comparative progress has been made in the
medical branch of the work.
