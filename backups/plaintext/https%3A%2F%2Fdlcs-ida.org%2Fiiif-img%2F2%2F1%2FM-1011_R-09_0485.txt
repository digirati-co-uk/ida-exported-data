Annual RYportCarson School.For the most part the white population of the statehas looked down upon the Indian and it is only in rare instancesthat the public schools will receive Indian children. The sentiment in this respect is changing. The Carson high school hasamong its students four or five Indian boys and girls, graduatesof the Carson Indian School. The outing system is changing theattitude of the whites. They are glad to have the boys and girlswork on farms and in families, and almost universally they findthem very satisfactory help. This summer nearly fifty of thelarger school girls were placed in families in Berkeley and Oakland and about twenty- five were placed in families near the school.They are paid from$ 15 to$ 40. per month. The boys are in greatdemand for ranch work and during the present season are receivingfrom$ 3. to$ 4. per day, with board.There are many Indian children in the state that are notin school, but the State legislature at its last session passed alaw which makes it compulsory for Indian children to be in someschool, and in view of this, it is expected that the only difficultythat will be experienced will be the inability of the school toreceive all the pupils that should be here when school is in session.The school with its academic department and with its shopsand farm and domestic departments will be able to give excellentinstruction to the Indian boys and girls, and to train them to become useful citizens.
