INSCRIPTION ROCK
Gallup, located on the Park to Park Highway and
the National Old Trails Road, the shortest and best
route between New York and Los Angeles, is a
division point on the Santa Fe Railroad, and the
gate- way to many sections of scenic interest such
as Zuni, Inscription Rock, the Navajo country, the
Hopi Indian villages, Canyon de Chelly, Canyon del
Muerto and Rainbow Natural Bridge. Mesa Verde
National Park, the only one created by the govern
ment for the preservation of antiquities, is readily
accessible. The road, almost due north from
Gallup, leads thru the Ute and Navajo Indian Res.
orvations.
Inscription Rock, 42 miles from Gallup, has
been called the stone autograph album. On its
walls are hundreds of inscriptions extending over
a period of three hundred years, the earliest of
which, still decipherable, recites the return of the
Adelantado, Governor and Captain- General, Juan
de OÃ±ate from the discovery of the Gulf of Calif.
ornia in 1606; another inscription is that of Vargas
who reconquered New Mexico in 1692. See cut
below. The Rock is now a National Monument.
Every year a greater number of busy business
men as well as those who love the out- of- doors are
making trips thru this, both the oldest and newest
region in the United States. Both the Mexican
and Indian life- modified, of course- exist today
side by side with that of the up- to- date American.
A mile or more above the sea, the summer air
is always pure and cool.
An ideal country for unusual outings.
Free Camp Grounds for Auto Tourists. Ample
hotel accommodations for those who travel by rail.
