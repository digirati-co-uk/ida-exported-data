My Dear Sir:-
Owing to the sinall pox scare, a great many of of the boys
belonging to the foot ball team have been vaccinated, and are not able
to practice, and I fear will not be able to keet your boys on noxt
Saturday.
I believe they will be in shape on the Saturday following, and
will then be able to play the gams.
Very truly yours,
a hlut
