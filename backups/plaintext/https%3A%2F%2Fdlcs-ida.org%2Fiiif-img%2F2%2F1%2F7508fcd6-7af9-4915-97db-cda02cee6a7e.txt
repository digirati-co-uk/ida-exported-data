66.story of the building, and there is a gradual slope toward the southeast from the building site for the construction of good sewerage.Referring to the country west of the reservati on I desire to statethat I made particular inquiry of all persons whom I met, who were familiar with the territory embraced in the contemplated extension of reservation, as to the amount of water and grass it contained and its desirability as a range for the Indian he rds, and I was informed by S. S.Preston, Indian Trader at pillow Springs, James Black, and E. M. Tackettprospectors, Ashton nebeker and Joseph Tanner of Tuba City, and others,all of whom are familiar with the character of the country and its resources, that grass is very scarce throughout the territory referred to,except in the western portion, where water is scarce, in consequence ofwhich a large tract of good grassland cannot be utilized for summergrazing, but affords good winter range when snow is on the ground, andall of them believed that, from the nature of the soil, water could besecured for use of stock, by a system of storage reservoirs, at comparatively small expense.In this connection I submit, that water being very scarce throughoutthe western portion of the Navajo and Moqui reservations and the countrybordering upon same, in consequence of which there are a number of goodgrazing sections that cannot be utilized for want of water, and, as it isgenerally believed that reservoirs to retain flood waters sufficient tomeet requirements could be constructed at a moderate cost, on the ranges,I would respectfully suggest that inspector Graves be directed to examinethe sections of country referred to with a view to the establishment of anumber of small storage reservoirs, as from his experience and knowledgeof such work he would be able to judge whether or not such system wouldbe practical, and meet the requirements of the Navajos for watering theirherds, which, if supplied would enable them to utilize the grass of extensive arid tracts of good grazing lands, that are at present unused,except in winter when sufficient snow is on the ground to substitutewater..Regarding the lines upon which the Navajo Indian Reservation shouldbe extended, I have the honor to state that, whilst the line recomnendedby Acting Agent.
