IndustriesThe native industryof the Navajo Indians, consistingof the weaving of the Navajo blanket is highly important, atpresent. There is a particulardemand for the Navajo productatthe present time, particularly if the standard of the product isgood. The work is suffering to some extent by the influence ofoutsiders who try to influence the Indians to make various designswhich, of course, are not the native Indian patterns. Also due tothe fact that the length of time required to weave a rug makes theeconomic value of weaving questionable. All the traders appear toâ€¢ be doing a heavy business in the Navajo rug and this industry w111doubtless continue for some years.There is apparently no tribal counsel on the LeuppJurisdiction. Two men of the tribe seem to have a great amount ofinfluence over this respective sections However, an attempt hasbeen made to work thio ugh these in furthering matters along industrial lines. It would seem the proper caurse to encourage abetter selection of rams in the hope of improving the wool of theherds and the introduction of the milk strain of gosts in order toenable the Indians to have milk in their diet. The milch goat willsubsist on the brush and weeds of nthe desert just as well as theNavajo goat. Its quality of meat is as good as the Navajo goat withthe additional qualification of being able to produce a reasonableamount of milk. It is believed that much good can be done in thisline. Bucks can be furnished from the school herd at a nominalcoast, which will do much to improve the standard of the presentNavajo goat.There have been no allotments nor sales of Indians landsduring the past year.
