A. Inaddition to the school work being conducted at the Sanatorium
where we have two teachers employed, we also have the school of the
Dutch Reform Mission unit which the Department by cooperative agreement
assists to operate. This school has an attendance of about 90. A small
public school is also operated for which the Government pays tuition for
Indian children. Twenty( 20) Indian children are now enrolled,
With the Indians now living in the mountanous area where weather
conditions are very severe and the cost of road building excessive it
does not seem feasible at present to try day schools, During the winter
months the families are now with their sheep on the winter range many
miles removed intemporary quarters. Summer day schools do not seem
possible ei ther in this exceptionally rough country. To overcome this
condition it is proposed to encourage the Indians to build permanent homes
on the southern portion of their reservation where home conditions
would be much better and where eventually a public school system could be
developed. This is a project which will take many years to work out
but is offered now for approved as a definite project,
