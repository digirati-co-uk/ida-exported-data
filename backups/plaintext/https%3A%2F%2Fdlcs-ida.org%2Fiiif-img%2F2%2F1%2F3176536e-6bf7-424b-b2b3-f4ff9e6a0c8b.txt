We were visited during the year by Special Agent Brown,
Supervisors Peairs and Newberne, Assistant Supervisor Coon
and Inspector Trailer.
The commencement exercises were ushered in May 28th, by
a most excellent sermon to the class, by the Reverend Aschie
Toothacker, Pastor of the Congregational Church of Albuquer
que. His subject was," Friend, go up higher". The sermon
was especially helpful in suggestions and inspiration.
The play," The Captain of Plymouth," was given on Monday
evening for the pupils and employes and repeated Tuesday even
ing for the public. On the second occasion the auditorium was
crowded with an appreciative audience, which was generous in
its expression of approval. On Wednesday at 1: 30 p. m. com
pany and battalion drill and regimental dress parade were gir
en on the parade grounds. Later in the afternoon a lay Fete
was given on the lawn, consisting of folk dances, drills and
may- pole dance. In the evening the annual declamation con
test was held in the auditorium, two girls and three boys par
ticipating. They showed careful training and acquitted them
selves with due credit. These exercises were attended by many
of the people from the city of Albuquerque. On Thursday af
ternoon, June 1st, at 3: 30, the graduating class gave a pro
gram, consisting of valedictory, class history, prophecy, ora
tions and musical numbers. In the evening at 8: 00., be
fore a large audience, Supervisor Peairs delivered an address
to the graduates. It was an able effort and contained much
good advice and council to the members of the class and pupils.
