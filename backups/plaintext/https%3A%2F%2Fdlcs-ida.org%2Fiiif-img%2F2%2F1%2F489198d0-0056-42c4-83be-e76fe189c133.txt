Schools( continued)
Hopi Indian Agency
In my opinion it will be necessary to continue these
schools for many years. It is my judgment that money put in
such schools as we have here brings far better results than
the same amount of money put in non- reservation schools. The
Hopi day schools have done wonderful work, and they can be
useful for many years to come, especially if they are equipped
and allowed
to carry children through the sixth grade. The
boarding school should do the same thing for the Navajos if al.
lowed to carry children through the sixth grade. The capacity
of the boarding school should be enlarged to take care of all
the Navajo children up to the sixth grade. Transfers the
should be made in both the boarding and day schools after the
children have finished the sixth grade. This would be an ideal
arrangement, not only so far as the work is concerned, but on
behalf of the Indians, both Hopis and Nava jos, who are greatly
interested in these schools.
