- 138.9.( c) These Ind ians are very well supplied with horses and inthe greater number of cases, need no help along these lines.6. We are purchasing fence material under the reimbursable regulations in order that the Zunis may protect their fields.The last two years have shown considerable advancement madein the condition of the roads upon the reservation and as wenow have a caterpillar tractor and a road grader, with fundsnow furnished by Congress, we shall be able to extend thegraded roads upon the reservation.7. The Indians are required to do a certain amount of Workupon the roads. No difficulty is experienced in securingtheir assistance as they appreciate the benefits of improvedroads.The water resources are not sufficiently developed. TheIrrigation Department has a man now working along these lines.Not only are more dans needed for irrigation purposes but forwater for their stock. This is one of the greatest needs ofthe Zunis and early attention should be given it.These Indians are not allotted. They live in villages andare unable to have miloh cows, poultry, and the things so necessary for better health and development because of this fact.10. No lands are leased upon the reservation. Some of the olderIndians allow the younger ones to use some of the lands towhich they claim title and for this use they levy tribute toalmo st the value of the crop.11. I would not recommend the leasing of any of this land tooutsiders.12.( a) These Indians cannot increase the size of their herdsbut they are holding the number they formerly possessed.They are improving in quality and because of range conditionssome action will need to be taken in reducing the size of theherds.( b) Very little loss has been sustained during the past year.( o). Very few of the Indians feed during the winter. Morecould do this to advantage and every encouragement is giventhem to feed their old ewes and their rams, especially inearly spring.
