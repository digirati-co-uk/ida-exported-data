Well its here! We made it through! Wasn' t exactly easy but we managed.
Fortitude! I know that the last two years of High school were my best! I met
new friends and gained new experiences. To all my cherished friends and
classmates, both from' 08 and' 09, thanks for the good times and laughs. To
my family, thank you for the undying support and love. To my dearest,
Amber aka Skittle Burst, stay up, cuz you know your cool like that. You
will always be a part of me. I love you. Thanks for all the fun times, smiles,
and pics. You have made my last year the best. And to all the other friends I
hold dear, forgive me for not mentioning you, but much love. I' m out! SFIS
see you when I make my return as one of the Few, and Proud, a U. S.
Marine. Semper Fidelis!
