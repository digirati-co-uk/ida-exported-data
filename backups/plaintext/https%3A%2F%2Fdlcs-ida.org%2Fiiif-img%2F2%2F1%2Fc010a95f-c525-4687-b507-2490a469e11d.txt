ear sir:
About the first of July last had occasion
to borrow
f'rom the New Mexico enitentiary
nire( 9 cords of wood, needed
l'or irmediate
use in burning
brick
.
I expected
to repay this
with wood from the present
year's
supply
to be hauled
from the
mountains
with the sohool
teams
; before
sufficient
wood could be
procured
, the pupils
of the school
were transferred
to other
schools
by order
of the Indiar
Office
, thus leaving
the school
without
sufficient
help
to procure
the wood
request
that
this
wood
( nine
cords
! be returned
to the
jew Mexico
enitertiary
with
wood
you purchase
for the
school
,
very
respectfully
,
Amilart
Superintendent
