117With respect to reservation boundaries, as noted in detail laterin this report, during the period April 25 to May 31, 1916,U. 8. Inspector H. S. Traylor made an investigation of the Moqui IndianReservation, accompanied by the Superintendent, and among numerousother things the matter of boundaries was considered.Later theInspector submitted with his report a map and recommendations concerning suggested changes in boundaries, which would likely fix the presentjurisdiction and obviate puzzling questions that often cause dispute.It is believed that he recommended the establishment of an additionalagency in the Harsh Pass country, immediately north of the northMoqui line, such agency to relieve the Moqui Superintendent ofconsiderable jurisdiction over country adjacent to the north line andextending to the northwest corner beyond the natural barrier knownas Blue Canon; also that he recommended a new boundary cutting off theentire southwest corner of the Moqui Reservation( such area to besupervised by the Leupp superintendent) the line to extend from about" The Lakes" to a point on" Cedar Ridge," where the west Moqui linetraverses.The Navajo Indians inhabiting the areas thus cut outhave pretty generally believed that they should report to either theWestern Navajo Agency or the Leupp Agency, notwithstanding that theyactually reside on the Moqui Indian Reservation.2
