Swan, shoe and harness- maker, knowsbutvery littleabout this business.He had previouslybeena carpenter.The schoolbooksare badlyworn and new ones are needed.In connectionwith the schoolthereis a bout 5 acrescultivated as a schoolgarden.The Industrialteacherand the schoolboys have cultivatedit very well.The yieldof corn, cabbage,beets, turnips, and pumpkinswas quitelarge, supplying thewantsof the school.7 cows are milkedby the schoolboys.They make sufficientbutterto supplytheirwantsand havea surplusof milk whichcould, with the slops, be profitablyused in fattening 8 or 10 hogs.There beingno hogs suppliedthe school, wouldrecommendthe purchaseof one boar and four broodsows.In addition to the workin the garden, caringfor the 7 cows, the boyscut the woodfor the schooland do choresgenerally.There isbut( one) femalepupillargeenoughto do any work and she assistsin ironing, cookingand mending.The most necessaryrequirementis a new schoolbuildingofthe capacityfor comfortablyaccommodatingat least60 or 70pupils.The presentaccommodationsare meagreand incomplete.I find the schoolin bettershapethan ever before, and Ibelieveit may be calleda successfor the reasonthat I observedmuch good had been done and the childrenhad made commendableprogress.000Respectfullysubmitted,5859, IndianDivision,RosultsOctober26, 1886.Chief IndianDivision.
