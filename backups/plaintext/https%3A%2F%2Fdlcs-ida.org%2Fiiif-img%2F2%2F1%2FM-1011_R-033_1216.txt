1Anmal Report, 1930NARRATIVE SECTIONTAI and ORDEREASTERN NAVAJO JURISDICTIONSince the occupancy of the new office we have ample administration facilities, though three new large desks are needed and twelvesettees for the use of Indians. The census, homesteading and allotment work have been quite heavy but for the past two years have beenunder the direction of Mr. Charles E. Roblin, special alloting Agent.His clerk, who has been giving his time to allotment and census records, should be permitted to remain here for some time to come asit is absolutely impossible for us to keep records current as noneof the other olerks could be spared for this work.

Those married legally and where they cannot livetogether, and show incompatibility, must get their divorce in theDistrict courts.Full compliance with the laws of the State is urged, though asyet we are unable to enforce marriage and divorce laws of the State,but this situation is improving.
