lack of water for use of livestock upon the ranges;
poor her√§ing and grazing methods by the Indians due
to lack of the proper methods; and the continued
overstocking of the range within reach of water.
The most important step toward adequate range
improvement is the development of water upon the sheep
ranges. Due to lack of sufficient funds no water
resources have been developed, other than a few in
adequate improvements made by a few sheep owners them
selves. By the development of small springs and the
use of water troughs, the construction of several
reservoirs or tanks and the drilling of wells upon the
stock ranges considerable unused range can then be
utilized. This will also provide means of utilizing
the range at the season of the year when the forage
can best be utilized without resulting in further range
deterioration.
The serious condition of the stock ranges has
brougnt on a condition of soil erosion which is rapidly
becoming worse. The loose soil of low organic content
which is characteristic of the reservation lanas, is
inducive to rapid washing with the advent of heavy
rains which often occur in the summer months. This
erosion has resulted in the silting of the Blackrock
Reservoir to the point where its present capacity is
only 3, 100 acre feet of water or one- fourth of its
original capacity.
