U. S. Indian Industrial School,
Santa Fe, New Mexico, June 1, 1900.
Hon. Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
Washington, D. C.
sir;-
In enswer to circular office letter No. 38 Education, dated April
16, 1900, 1 submit the following.
Miss Hattie Mayfield, teacher of Santo Domingo Day School, and a
probationer, is in my judgement unfitted for the Indian Service. She is
certainly unfitted for the position she now holds, and I recommend that
she be dropped.
She is lacking in industry, energy, skill and tact. Her school is
very unsatisfactory and attendance irregular. A woman of strength of
character, tact and ability is required in this Pueblo, if the school
is to be a success.
I Lherefore trust that Hattie Mayfield may be relieved from the
position which she now holds June 30, 1900. I cannot recommend her
continuancs in the service.
Very, respectfully,
Loomus
Aupwant aan dunt.
