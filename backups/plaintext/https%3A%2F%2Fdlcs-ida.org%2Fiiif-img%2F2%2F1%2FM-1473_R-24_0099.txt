86U. S. Indian Industrial School,Santa Fe, New Mexico, June 1, 1900.Hon. Commissioner of Indian Affairs,Washington, D. C.sir;-In enswer to circular office letter No. 38 Education, dated April16, 1900, 1 submit the following.Miss Hattie Mayfield, teacher of Santo Domingo Day School, and aprobationer, is in my judgement unfitted for the Indian Service. She iscertainly unfitted for the position she now holds, and I recommend thatshe be dropped.She is lacking in industry, energy, skill and tact. Her school isvery unsatisfactory and attendance irregular. A woman of strength ofcharacter, tact and ability is required in this Pueblo, if the schoolis to be a success.I Lherefore trust that Hattie Mayfield may be relieved from theposition which she now holds June 30, 1900. I cannot recommend hercontinuancs in the service.Very, respectfully,LoomusAupwant aan dunt.
