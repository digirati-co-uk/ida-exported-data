â€¢ 5-III. Agricultural Development.A. Agricultural Development.The Navajo during the past year has shown a much greaterinterest in farming. Many have reclaimed good- sized gardens and farmson which they have been able to raiso enough to add greatly to theirstore of food supplies. Thoir desire to secure this land was shown bytheir willingness to donate a large amount of labor for making canals,constructing headgates, etc.Production of vegetables was more than double theamount produced the preceding year.Several small new irrigation projects were locatedand considerable work was done on them during the past year.
