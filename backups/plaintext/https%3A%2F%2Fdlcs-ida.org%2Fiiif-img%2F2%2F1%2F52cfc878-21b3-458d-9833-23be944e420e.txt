Sunset on the MountainsBy FLORA C. RAYAcomaIt was a cold and cloudy day. It was snowing on the Sandia mountains towardevening as the sun was going down. It uncovered itself from the clouds and onecould see it shine only on the mountains. Various colors were formed from the sun,and as it went down the colors would change and seem to advance a little on themountains. It continued changing colors until finally when it reached the crest ofthe mountains it was just one color, pink. This color grew duller and duller untilthe sun had set, and then the mountains were entirely a dark blue.Old OraibiBy LYDIA COOYAWYMAHopiWhen looking toward the west, down from the valley of New Oraibi, at firsta person sees the winding road leading up to the mesa and from a distance the roadlooks narrow and of a light cream color. Coming to the top of this mesa, whichis Old Oraibi, one sees the village of ruined houses, and a little distance towardthe southeast of this village there stands a lonely old Monnenite Church. Now, oneobserves the ground which looks gray. from the distance, but when one comescloser he will find that the earth is mostly covered with small particles of brokenpottery and bones which have been burned up. The earth itself is chiefly composedof ashes which had been thrown out by the people who once lived there. Even upto this day, only a few people live on top of the third ruin.
