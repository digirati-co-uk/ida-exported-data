ADIANAFFA,FFICERECEIVEDJUL301910ANNUAL REPORT, CARSOIN SCHOOL, 1910.LAND DIVISION- FORESTRY SERVICE.There is no reservation under this superintendency butmany of the scattering Indians who seem to be regarded as underthe supervision of this office to some extent have non- reservationallotments. Most of these allotments are without any timber ofany consequence and no steps have been taken to market it, suchas there is, even for fuel. Some of the allotments in adjacentparts of California north of here, have some timber upon thernand some offere have been made for such timber but so far as Inov, no regular steps have been taken to market it. In thisConnection, will say that when there is an isolated allotmentin which locality tinber is being cut, it is probable that theIndians should be given permission to sell as there might not beany market for this timber again in many years if the countryaround it was cut off and the transportation facilities removed.I know of some slich cases, and have heard of a number of otherswhere this condition prevails. Ae to the amount of timber onthese allotments, it would be impossible to give even an approxinate estimate. There are many allotments in California, some ofwhich have timber on but many of which are bare.
