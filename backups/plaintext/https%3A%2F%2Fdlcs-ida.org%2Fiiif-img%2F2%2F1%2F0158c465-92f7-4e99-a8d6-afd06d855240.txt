We worked on the Health Books, which they plan to take
home with them. We made a page telling about the cleanliness
habits which they are to remember to do at home this summer.
We drew pictures showing how the blankets and skins should
be taken care of.
Marcelino and Kee stained the frames around the screens,
and the window boxes.
Our flowers are not doing very well. Some of them
are dying. Marcelino said," Most of the plants died, just
the wild flowers lived. He was not quite right, as we
still have enough plants to make pretty flowers for our
window boxes, if they grow.
Each day we write a few lines for our Class Record
Book, and they tell about their own work in their diaries.

Lindy, Leonard, and Earl finished up the bird house
to- day. They plastered over the twigs on the roof with
the wet clay. They stained the house with the brown stain.
NOW we have a Hogan Bird House: We hope some pretty blue
birds come to live in it,
We drew another picture for our Health Books. We talked
about where we obtain water for drinking purposes. we dis
cussed the question of getting pure water, and keeping it clean.
We drew a barrel showing how the cover should be kept on tightly.
They printed on the page," Keep the barrel covered and clean."
Some printed on their page," keep the water barrel clean."
