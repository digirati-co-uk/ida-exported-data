Some of themare dying. Marcelino said," Most of the plants died, justthe wild flowers lived. He was not quite right, as westill have enough plants to make pretty flowers for ourwindow boxes, if they grow.Each day we write a few lines for our Class RecordBook, and they tell about their own work in their diaries.May 18,Lindy, Leonard, and Earl finished up the bird houseto- day.
