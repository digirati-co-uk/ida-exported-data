provided, it is once more productive. The six pueblos under
the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District should show a large
increase in crop production in the next few years. Educating
the Indians and getting their consent to the Conservancy Dis
trict has taken a great deal of time,
The two Indian Stockomen appointed a year before have done
very good work in the advancement of the Acoma and Isleta
Indians in agricultural practices, and with the transfer of the
pueblos of Cochiti and Santo Domingo to this jurisdiction, it
is quite imperative that another Stockman be granted this Agency,
The Indians as a general rule have suitable farm equipment
and the practice of this jurisdiction has been to discourage the
use of reimbursable moneys for this purpose, as it has been
difficult in the past to make collections on seeds and equip
ment. With the new land that it will be necessary to break in
the next few years, two or more tractors could be used very
handily for this purpose as the Indian horses are too small for
this heavy work.
With the tribal system of government in the pueblos, they
attend to the fencing and road needs, Encouragement and efforts are
being made to get the outside boundaries of the different Grants
fenced and while some progress is being made those opposed to such
a plan are holding up the work.
With the construction work of the Middle Rio Grande Conserv
ancy District now going on, we expect a great improvement in the
water supply of the six pueblos affected, and the District should
result in a supply of water for the entire season and avoid con
ditions as exist at the present time with a dry river and no water
available Some Isleta crops are only being saved as a result of
using water from the drainage ditohes already under construction,
Water development in the other pueblos is conducted by the
Indian Irrigation Service as funds will permit.
There are no allotments or tribal herds under this juris
diction,
The Pueblo Indians are taking advantage of the tourist travel
and using it as a means of increasing revenue from their native
crafts such as jewelry and pottery making.
The pueblo form of government consists of a Governor and
Counoilmen, and this body conducts the business of the pueblo,
therefore, it is quite impossible to perfeot chapter organizations
as the Indians resent any other organizations very much, and all
work is taken up through the pueblo officers.
