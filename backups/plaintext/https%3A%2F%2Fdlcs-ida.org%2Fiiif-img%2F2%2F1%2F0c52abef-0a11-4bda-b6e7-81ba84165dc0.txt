As this reservation can never be an extensivefarming country, the Indians' range should be protected for thom.Most of the allotments are not worth the cost of building a fence aroundthem. As the odd numbered sections of the land belongs to some railroadcompany, it would be impossible to fenoe a grazing section of more than onesection. There are but few improvements on any of the allotments. Theimprovements generally consist of a hogan duilt of poles and rocks and acorral.TWO Stookmen and one Additional Farmer are employed on this reservation, but as no quarters are yet provided for them, much of their time istaken up with other duties, than that of giving instruction to the Indians.
