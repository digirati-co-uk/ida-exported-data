adverse claims under the requirements
of said Pueblo Lands Act of June 7, 1924;
and that unless the United States shall be permitted
to join as defendants in
its bill to quiet title to
the lands of each Pueblo the numerous claimants
therein, against each of whom it has a like cause
of action and against each of whom it seeks the same relief, and whose pretended claims
are based
upon
similar facts and involve
the same questions of law, it will be driven to bring a great number of
distinct and separate actions; and that it will be practically impossible
for the United
States to
prosecute, and for the Court to adjudicate and dispose of so large a number of separate and distinct
suits within any reasonable length of time; that by reason of the matters
and things aforesaid,
plaintiff and said Pueblo have to plain, adequate
or complete
remedy at law.

and set forth the facts and nature of any claim or claims whatsoever made or asserted by them ad.

be adjudged and decreed that any and all right, title or interest claimed
or asserted
by said defend

with the full possession
and control
thereof by said Pueblo
