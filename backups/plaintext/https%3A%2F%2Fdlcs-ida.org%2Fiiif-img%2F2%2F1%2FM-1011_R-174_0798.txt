Dear Sir:

Referring to your notation of error on page eighteen
of our statistical report for the fiscal year 1927 in which
the original area of the Zuni reservation was given as 257,
662. 69 acres, we wish to advise that after checking the add
ing machine tape which was sent with your notation of error
against the township plats of the reservation which are on
file in this office, we arrive at a total of 257, 580. 37 acres.
We are returning the tape which was sent with the differences
checked thereon. We also wish to call attention to the fact
that Township 12, Range 18 included in your a√•ditions is not
within the boundary of the Zuni reservation.
The figures as given on our statistical report for the
acreage of the reservation were taken from figures shown on
an old map of the reservation which we found on file in this
office. These figures were taken from this map because at
the time the statistical report was being made up we could
find no other figures available, and presumed that they were
correct.
We are writing a letter to the Commissioner of the Gen
eral Land Office requesting him to give us the correct acre
age of the original Zuni reservation and township plats and
the correct acreage of additions to the reservation by Ex
cutive Orders as covered by presidential proclamation setting
aside certain lands from the Manzano Forest as a part of the
Zuni reservation. This letter is being forwarded herewith
for transmittal to the Commissioner of the General Land Office
together with a copy for the Indian Office files.
Very truly yours,
AMAUS.
Iotter,
Superintendent.
