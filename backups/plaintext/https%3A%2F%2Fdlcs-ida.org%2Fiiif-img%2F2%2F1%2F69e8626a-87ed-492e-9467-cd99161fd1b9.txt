Mt. Pleasant SchoolMichiganANNUAL REPORTNARRATIVE SECTIONSection IV----------- IndustriesThis section does not affect this school but very littleas farming, stock raising, etc., is a very small item on accountof the smail number of tracts of land still hela by the localIndians. The Indians earn their living mostly by labor amongthe farmers and in the local industries, especially the oilfields of late. Basket making is practically the only distinctIndian industry followed. A considerable number of basketsare made and sold but more suitable methods of disposing of thesearticles should be developed. The local sale is small and theprice obtained is not as renumerative as IX it should be. Itis not difficult for the Indians to find the labor desired andit is really not necessary to assist in this matter with theexception of placing the young Indian girls in proper environments.PopulationAs this particular Chippewa tribe does not have any fundswith the Government, and as the members of this tribe are notwhat are commonly known as wards, the business councils orCommittees have very little importance as far as their help orhindrance in the proper disposal of the Superintendent' s officialduties are concerned. They receive no funds from the Governmentin any way and have not for many years past.
