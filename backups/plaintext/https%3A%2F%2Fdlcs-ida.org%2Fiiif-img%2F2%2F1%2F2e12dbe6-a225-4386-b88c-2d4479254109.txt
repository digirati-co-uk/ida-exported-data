taThere has been ample opportunityfor these Indians tosecure work off the reservationsand a great many of them haveavailed themselvesof this during the winter months, while othershave secured permanentemploymentin Albuquerqueand in the railroadshops along the Santa Fe Railroad.The demand for Indian girls for domestic work is greatlyin excess of the number of girls who are willing to take up thiskind of work, so that there is no trouble at all for any Indian girlto secure domestic employmentin Albuquerqueshould they desire toleave the pueblo.We have had practicallyno success in the organizationoffarm chaptersamong the Indians of this jurisdictionbecause eachpueblo is governed by a Governor and Council who have completechargeof all the activitiesof the pueblo, and they resent very stronglyany other organizationthat would tend to interfere with any of theirduties. The pueblo of Laguna, however, has an organizationof sheepmen, which handles the problems of their range as a sub- committeetothe Council. This has been organizedfor a number of years and isvery successful, but until the governmentsof the other pueblos becomemuch more democraticthan they are at present there is no hope ofcreating any similar organizationwithin them.As the pueblos of this jurisdictionare composed of patentedlands and Executive Order reservations, there are no allotmentsin thejurisdiction. All land is held as communityland and is distributedamong the Indians in accordancewith their tribal customs.( Vin A LowuoC2Lem A. Towers,Superintendent,LAT: AD
