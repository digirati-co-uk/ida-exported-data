SUPERINTENDENT JOSEPH ABEYTA
Superintendent Joseph Abeyta stands in front of the new Math, Science and
Technology Building.
Dear Students:
As I recall the day when the class of 2001 first enrolled at Santa Fe Indian School, I cannot help
but be amazed by all the changes that have taken place since our seniors came to us as seventh graders.
And experience tells me that all the changes we have faced over the past several years will only increase as
we begin this new millennium. I feel it is important that we think of this new millennium as a time of tremen
dous possibility.
Today' s young people, including yourselves, face challenges and demands that alumni of past years
did not face. It is important, I think, that each of these challenges be viewed as opportunities.
Three years ago, the Santa Fe Indian School confronted facilities that were obsolete, unsafe, and
unfit for our students. We decided not to call the situation a problem, and instead looked at the situation
as an opportunity, an opportunity that has led us to a new building and plans for a new campus that will be
constructed over several years. My advice is that each of you do the same: look at the challenges in your
lives as opportunities.
Success at changing challenges to opportunities involves commitment, focus, and desire. My wish
for you is that through your lifetime of learning, you triumph in your own way in changing your challenges
into opportunities, and opportunities into success.
Sincerely
,
Dal
Chent
Joseph Abeyta, Superintendent
