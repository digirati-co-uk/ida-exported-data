All I have to say is as you move on in life you have tomake choices. The choice you make is often a difficult one so whateverchoices you make just know you have your friends and family alwaysbehind you and there' s always a firefighter near if you have anyproblems so peace and keep in touch. Here' s a prayer I live by and whoknows maybe someday it will be yours.A Firemans' PrayerWhen I am called to duty, God, wherever flames may rage. Give me strength tosave some life whatever be its age. Help me to embrace a child before it is toolate, or save an older person from the horror of that fate. Â· Enable me to be alertand hear the weakest shout. And quickly and efficiently to put the fire out I wantto fill my calling and to give the best in me To guard my every neighbor andprotect his property. And if according to my fate, i am to lose my life, Pleasebless with your protecting hand my children and wife.
