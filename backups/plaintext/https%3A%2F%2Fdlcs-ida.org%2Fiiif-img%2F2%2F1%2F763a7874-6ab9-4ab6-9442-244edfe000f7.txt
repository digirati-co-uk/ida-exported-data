Hi. What' s up? All I have to say is as you move on in life you have to
make choices. The choice you make is often a difficult one so whatever
choices you make just know you have your friends and family always
behind you and there' s always a firefighter near if you have any
problems so peace and keep in touch. Here' s a prayer I live by and who
knows maybe someday it will be yours.
A Firemans' Prayer
When I am called to duty, God, wherever flames may rage. Give me strength to
save some life whatever be its age. Help me to embrace a child before it is too
late, or save an older person from the horror of that fate. Â· Enable me to be alert
and hear the weakest shout. And quickly and efficiently to put the fire out I want
to fill my calling and to give the best in me To guard my every neighbor and
protect his property. And if according to my fate, i am to lose my life, Please
bless with your protecting hand my children and wife.
