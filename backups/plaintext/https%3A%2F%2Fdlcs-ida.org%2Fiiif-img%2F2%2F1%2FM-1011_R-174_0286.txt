should not be allowed on the reservation. It does not
produce nearly grass enough for the Indians' stock,
The Indians are using all of the reservation
range and lease considerable on the outside
The number of well bred sires for stock of
the Indians is not enough to take care of the proper
inprovenent of the stock

Conditions on the reservation are not favor
able to the carrying on of the dairy industry.
I do not reconnend, under existing conditions,
the furtherance of this industry here. Range conditions
nake it impossible, Stock has to travel miles in a sing
le day to find enough grazing to exist.
A dairy herd is not kept at the school.
Such a herd should be provided as soon as a
suitable dairy barn can be constructed in which to care
for it. We have nothing of this kind at present. We are
now raising sufficient alfalfa to furnish grass and hay
for a small herd.
It will not be practicable for the Indians to
keep Inilch cows until such time as they will grow suffic
ient alfalfa to feed them,

The nakin of pottery is about the only other
industry anong these Indians. They derive a considerable
income from this industry.
