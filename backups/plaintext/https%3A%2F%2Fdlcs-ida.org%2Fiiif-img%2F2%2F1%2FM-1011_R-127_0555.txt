Annual Report19 13Santa Fe Schooland Agency.NARRATIVESection 5-- Field- Forestry.On re quost of this office, two hundred and litydollars was authorized for purchase of necessary lumber andmaterials for the construction of a log cabin for use of theforest guard on the Santa Clara reservation. An advantageouslocation was selected and the cabin, which is being built bythe forest guard and the Indian police, will provide a perma.nent headquarters for the forest guard, which will permit amore aficient supervision and protection of the reservationthan was possible before. I believe, too, that this stepwill oncourage the Indians in a more extensive cultivationof their farms on the reservationPending action on recommendations, submitted March16th, 1912, for the setting aside of Executive Order reservations for San Juan and San Ildefonso, and for the straight.ening of the southern boundary of the present Santa ClaraExecutive Order Reservation, no steps have been taken for theadvertisement and Bale of the merchantable timber on theSanta Clara Executive Order Reservation and the Shoe StringGrant, which, by resolution of its council, the Santa Clarapueblo desires to have advertised and sold at the same time,The Executive Order reservation recommended forSan Juan, which would adjoin the Santa Clara Executive OrderReservation on the north, contains some merchantable timber,too small in Oxtent to market by tselI, which it would beoxtremely desirable to sell in conjunction with the SantaClara timber. The Executive Order reservation recommendedfor San Ildefonso adjoins the Santa Clara Executive OrderReservation on the south, and is a part of the Jemez ForestReserve,To my knowledge no definite acts on has boon takenon the recommandations for Executive Order reservations forthe pueblos in this district, to provide the Indians withneeded timber, wood supply and grazing land. My observa.tion and information is that the merchantable timber on theSanta Clara reservation is not improving as time goes on,
