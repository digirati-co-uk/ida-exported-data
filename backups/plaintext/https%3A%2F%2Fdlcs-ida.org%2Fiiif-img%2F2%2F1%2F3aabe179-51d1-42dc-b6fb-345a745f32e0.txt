people for as far as I can ascertain, no effort was ever
made to secure this legislation, It bas never been pre

Indians are losing land, are persecuted in the local courts,
are made defendants to suits in the State Courts, where the
prejudice is so great that they can not receive justice,
involving title to their lands and ultimately lose it
In an endeavor to resist the invasion of the
rights, whioh the legislation would secure, the Superin

If those
in charge there were in the place of the Indians or the
Superintendent, a different attitude would be found and
possibly then they would and should worry.
The office may
disclaim responsibility for this state of affairs, but the
disclaimer will not stand,
If the suggestion made in my
report of 1917 were acted upon there might be ground for it
