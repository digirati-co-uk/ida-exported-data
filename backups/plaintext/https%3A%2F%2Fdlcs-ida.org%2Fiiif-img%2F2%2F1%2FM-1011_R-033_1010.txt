There werefewer ca ses of Impetigo among the children and less severe thena year ago. otherwise the general health of the school wasvery good. Keeping health charts and monthly weight recordspermits of check on any child's physical condition and specialattention for diet or medical attention is given that theircondition may demand. The parents respond to hospital andservices of physician and nur se more than ever and are takingincreased ad van tage of what facilities we have.It is urgent that a general hospital be constructed here assoon as funds can be provided and at least two other first aidhospitals be established at points of vantage, wi th physicians inthe field given nece ssary equipment, medicines, etc. to carryon eye treatment, treat infectious and contagious disease and giveaid of emergency nature when called upon. This plan wouldbe a great factor in the elimination of the Medicine man andthere would be i proved living conditions made possible thruthis contact of physician in a great field for service. Fielamatrons or field nurses could operate in conjunction withphysicians stationed in the field, but alone we do notreccommend same for it would be risky, working in isolateddistricts alone.
