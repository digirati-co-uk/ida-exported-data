Conditions at Santo Domingo andthe need that a day school be established at as early a date aspracticable, will be taken up in detail in rec omni–µndation soonto be submitted.Equipment at the day schools does not permit extensive industrial training, although the girls are instructed in sewing,and the children, under the direction of the teacher, assist thehousekeeper in keeping the building clean and orderly, and inthe care of the grounds,The present appearance of our day schools outwardly is any.thing but attractive. I find the grounds of many of then grownup to rank weeds, and devoid of any green surroundings, whichare particularly desirable in this country. It is proposed toset aside a portion of the grounds as a playground for the chil.dren, and through the planting of trees and blue grass seed- whichdoes very well under the se conditions- to make the schools attractive in appearanceAt most of the day schools the boys and girls have had gardenswhich they have planted and cultivated.. This is good training forthe children and the work is uniformly enjoyed by them. Anotheryear it is proposed to have children' s gardens in all the schoolswhere land and water are available.There are 8 Oome repairs and some little remodeling which isnecessary and which has been recommended at San Juan; the Officehas stated that the work will be done this summer, when the newfunds are available.The portable buildings which comprise the schoolhouse andquarters,at Zia should be replaced by substantial quarterg andschool. The quarters supplied the teacher and housekeeper areundesirable from every point of view The portable cottage isboth extremely hot in summer and cold in winter, and by reasonthereof, such disc omfort is experienced by employees as to nakethen discontented. This matter will be taken up more fully inreconnendation to be submitted in the near future.Bids have been submitted for construction of school plants
