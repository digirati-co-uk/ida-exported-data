A Farm UnitWhy this unit was chosen:( 1) The Navajo child has first handknowledge of country IIfe only; the situations provided forin a farm unit make a direct appeal to his understanding.

The children were permitted to examinemany pictures and books relating to farm life and farm animals.It proved no difficult matter to lead them to talk of animalsat home. The following is a brief outline of the work covered.I.

The children recalled their visit to theschool farm last fall. They told of helping to harvest vegetables. They discussed irrigation on the school farm. They drewa map of the school farm.B. Farms in general: The children learned that some farmsare many miles long and wide. Most farms are not so large.Some farms produce only corn and wheat. Some raise only fruit.Some produce only milk. But most farms produce a variety ofthings.LI. Products of the FarmA. Farm animals:( i) the children told of animals at home. Allhad sheep and goats. Some told of having to sell part of theirherds. This gave an opportunity to discuss care of the range;to justify the recent reduction of herds; to stress the factthat if the Navajo is to prosper he must not overstock the range.( 2) the children made lists of farm animals;( 3) they read storiesabout farm animals;( 4) they examined many pictures of farm animals; they learned, through pictures put out by the Bureau ofAnimal Industry, U.'s, Department of Agriculture, that animalsare bred for different purposes. For instance, some sheep makegood mutton, others produce excellent wool;some cattle arebred for the meat market, others for dairy purposes.
