Annual Report,Field- Irrigation- 6.Santa Fe Schooland Agency.At Santa Clara there is a tract of land, lyingin a general direction north and east of the Santa ClaraRiver, between this river and the land owned by theMexicans in the settlement of Gauchapange, which is, Ishould estimate, some four or five hundred acres in extent. This tract of land has a general slope toward theRio Grande from the foot- hills. The present surface flowof the Santa Clara River is used in the Mexican ditches ofthe Gaucha pange settlers, and in the ditches of the SantaClara Indians for tracts of land on the other side of theriver. A few small patches of land in the tract I havementioned are irrigated from the surface flow of the SantaClara River. I believe a pumping plant, similar to thatat San Ildefonso, would be feasible, which could be locatedin the bed of the Santa Clara River at a point above thistract. An investigation to determine the underflow of theSanta Clara River and the feasibility of such a pumpingplant is necessary, and should be made in the near future.The tract of land, which might be put under irrigation bysuch a pumping plant, is admirably situated, and would bea most desirable addition to the agricultural acreage ofthe Santa Clara IndiansBoth this project and the prospective pumpingplant at 3ia are small irrigating matters, and in my opinion could be handled at decided advan tage under the immed.iate supervision of the superintendent rather than underthe present conduct of such irrigation matters by theIrrigation Servica,I would respectfully recommend that specificrecommendations be made to Congress for an appropriationto start the construction of a storage reservoir on theTaos River. Preliminary surveys and reports on the estimated cost of such a reservoir have been made by theIrrigation Service, and I believe the matter is now underconsideration by the office. I am of the opinion that,unless the government bu1 lds this reservoir and the protection of the rights of the Taos Indians in the watersimpounded thus insured, this project will be undertakenofby private capital to the prejudice of the intereststhe IndiansRespectfully submitted,SuperintendHFC( c)
