Synopsis

Report of Inspector Armstrong

Mescalcro School.

Janua ry 18, 1887.
The Boarding school here contains 33 pupils, five of whom
only, are girls.
The buildings are partly adobe and partly frame
and unfit in every particular for school purposes.
It is a sur
prise to me to find any success either in management or training
with the miserable accommodations and limited facilities.
If
this Agency and reservation is to be continued a suitable building
for no pupils should be provided.
There is a saw mill here and
it would not cost a great deal to build one.
Sufficient land to
make
a farm can be obtained, which could be irrigat ed.
There is
a day school about 30 miles away which is slimly attended.
The
children could be all brought into the boarding school if they
could be cared for, and the teacher now there transferred.
А
good Industrial teacher will be required here if the school is
increased.
At present the position is vacant.
Respectfully submitted,
