The only records available for determining the contagiousand infectious diseases treated by the physician for the fiscal year1930 are taken from the annual report of that year.These records show:Venereal Diseases 42 cases, 37 males and 5 females.Influenza 386 cases, 25l males and 135 females,Dysentery 48 cases, 31 males and 17 females.Trachoma6 cases, 4 males and 2 females.OQe cannot determine if the se are" Hospital" or" Rest ofmAgency" cases or both. Also these reports do, not show whether they weretrea ted by the physician or not. The" Rest of the Agency" for part ofthe fiscal year 1930, was under the care of a field nurse working forthe Eastern Association. Apparently the then used monthly reposts givevery unsatisfactory detailed information in regard to contagious and infectious diseases,R. A. Carrow, M. D.
