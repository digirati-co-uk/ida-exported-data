There should be a floor ofmatched lumber laid over the rough boards and the room should beceiled and painted overhead. The building is substantial and presents a very good appearance on the outside, but with its rough anduneven surface on the inside, the stone having been laid in adobemud, it should be plastered, if only with adobe clay, and then whitewashed, which would give it a better appearance and be a much morecheerful room. This building is intended for a laundry and ironingroom when the plant is completed, and it should be better finishedthan at present, and as the required flooring can be gotten out atthe Agency mill and work done by employes of the Agency I would respectfully recommend its authorization.There were 40 pupils( 29 boys and il girls) in theschool when I visited it.
