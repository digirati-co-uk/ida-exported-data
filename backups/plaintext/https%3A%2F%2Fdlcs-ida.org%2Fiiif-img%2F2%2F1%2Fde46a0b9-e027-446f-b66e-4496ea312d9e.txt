Law& Order continued- 6.as by Special Liquor Officers employed under Chief OfficerLarson, has been maintained in this jurisdiction. Many convictions for selling liquor to Indians have been had, and manymore are pending. The liquor is not introduced upon the reservation to any extent by whites, but is bought to quite an extentby Indians who leave their Pueblos and, of course, in some casesThe Indians of Isleta hadis introduced by them after purchase.for many years manufactured a great deal of wine from theirgrapes, and last year the Superintendent, with the assistance ofthe Laborer from San Felipe and the Policeman at Isleta, destroyed450 galons by pouring it out upon the ground, and permitted theIndians to dispose of about 2,000 galons by selling it to l√∏quordealers at Albuquerque and other white settlements. There seemsto be no law by which the manufacture of liquor can be prevented,but after the liquor is made it can be destroyed, and the Indianshave been warned that it will be destroyed if manufactured duringthe present year, and they have manifested their intention ofselling their grapes and not making any wine from them.There are no saloons maintained on any of the reservations.ITO cooperation at all is extended by the State authoritiesin suppressing this traffic, but a most active and cordialcooperation is acknowledged by the Superintendent to Chief OfficerLarson, and particularly to United States Attorney Mr. Summers
