00May 21,OThe roof on the bird house had cracked, so the boysmade it over, mixing sand with the clay. When they hadfinished, the boys nailed it up in the tree. Del and Keethought they would like to make a bird house, so theystarted to make one this afternoon.On Monday we always have to clean the yard, as thechildren play around the Hogan over the week- end.We had a little review about the Cleanliness Habitswe had stressed during the year. They drew another picturefor their Health Books.The boys tell the girls about the work they do,while the girls are in the weaving room. The girls alsotell the boys about their work.May 22,Three of the boys worked at stretching the skin overthe seat, and the back of the chair. They punched smallholes in the leather, and sewed it with strips of leather.The skins has to be stretched tightly. The chair is made ofcedar, willow, yucca, goat skin; all native materials.Some of the boys continued to work on their birdhouses. They made them of little blocks of wood, andshaped them round lika a hogan.We are trying to finish up our work this week, andI am trying to have them learn to take pride in doingtheir work well. Some of them have the idea that mostanyway will do as long as it holds together.When it isbroken, they seem to wish to throw thing away, instead oftrying to repair of fix them up.
