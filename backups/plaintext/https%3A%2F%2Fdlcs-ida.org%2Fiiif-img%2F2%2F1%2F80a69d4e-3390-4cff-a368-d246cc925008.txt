O
The roof on the bird house had cracked, so the boys
made it over, mixing sand with the clay. When they had
finished, the boys nailed it up in the tree. Del and Kee
thought they would like to make a bird house, so they
started to make one this afternoon.
On Monday we always have to clean the yard, as the
children play around the Hogan over the week- end.
We had a little review about the Cleanliness Habits
we had stressed during the year. They drew another picture
for their Health Books.
The boys tell the girls about the work they do,
while the girls are in the weaving room. The girls also
tell the boys about their work.
May 22,
Three of the boys worked at stretching the skin over
the seat, and the back of the chair. They punched small
holes in the leather, and sewed it with strips of leather.
The skins has to be stretched tightly. The chair is made of
cedar, willow, yucca, goat skin; all native materials.
Some of the boys continued to work on their bird
houses. They made them of little blocks of wood, and
shaped them round lika a hogan.
We are trying to finish up our work this week, and
I am trying to have them learn to take pride in doing
their work well. Some of them have the idea that most
anyway will do as long as it holds together.
When it is
broken, they seem to wish to throw thing away, instead of
trying to repair of fix them up.
