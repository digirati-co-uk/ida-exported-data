Santa Fe, iew Mexico,February 14, 19303. Dodley Cornell,c/ o Hanna& Wilson,First Nat' l Bank Bidg.,Albuquerque, N. M.U. S. as Guardian of the Pueblo ofIs ieta v. Barbosa, ot al.Dear Mr. Cornell:Answering your letter of February 12th IT scall PableAbeyte' s desire to contest the Pablo Chavez de Padilla o laimalose to the Rio Grande. At his request I submitted the matterto the Attorney General asizing for instruction as to whether toBppeal, but although I have twice raminded him of this, I havereceived no ruling. I do not expect him to authorise an appealfor one reason, because the evidence as to the valuable part ofthe claim was directly aonioting, and although that of defendant may have been perjured, as it probably was, yet there is noway of showing that fast, and there was ample evidends on whichto base thecourt' s decision. This leaves only the bosque ofabout 11fteen acres and I do not think Its value b aLicient toJustify an appeal which could hope to Sasaeed only as to thatsmall and rather as a loss oreage. It the river has shifteditscourse at this place the land awardeis nonetheless, that described by metes and bounds in the Complaint. As to any excess, 1the Indians Can Bot aro with 6 mints as to the boundaries,I would think that any legal steps would fall within. ObohTane' s province,, In view of the fact that no appeal was contemplatedas to any of the claims oppt this one, the testimony has neverbeen written up. It was taken by IL Be Bolle Parker, and if youwant a copy I suggest that you request her to make it at the exponse of the Indians.With tind regards.Very si Deere yours,GAHF: ASpecial Assistant to theAttorney General.
