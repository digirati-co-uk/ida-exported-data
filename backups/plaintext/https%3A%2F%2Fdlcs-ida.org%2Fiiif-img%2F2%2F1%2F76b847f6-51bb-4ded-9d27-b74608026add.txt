These three schoos,
and Santo Domingo, need all available large rooms as
class rooms.
At Piouris, Encinal, Acomita, and Seama the schools
are housed in rented quarters.
The Se ama buildings,
while in good repair, are poorly arranged and entirely
too small for our purpose.
The buildings at Picuris,
Enoinal, and Acomita are a reproach to the Bureau.
No school farm has been established in this Agency.
Our pupils are all small.
All the agricultural
instruction that can be profitably given them is being
taught in the Pueblo Day Schools, with special emphasis
laid upon home gardening.
During the past school year the work in five schools
has been much embarrassed by the transfer of old teachers
and the changes caused by the late appointment of permanent
teachers to replace temporary appointees. It is respect
fully urged that all vacancies be filled for the year early
in the term, preferably before the reopening of school in
September.
Next year, two new teachers will be needed for Isleta
and Laguna, with possibly a third at Santo Domingo,
provided the attendance at the latter school is increased
to ninety children, as it should be in view of the fact
that the school population nurabers ninety- two children
not in school.
