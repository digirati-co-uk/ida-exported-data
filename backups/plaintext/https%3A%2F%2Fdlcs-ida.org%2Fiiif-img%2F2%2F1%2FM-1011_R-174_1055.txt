- 2-stock country, more especially adapted to the raising of sheepas it affords both winter and summer range, but because of thelack of water development, in the me sas and the broken countrya full use of the range in these sections cannot be secured.SECTION IThe past winter has been the most severe known to the older Indians, or to the old settlers in this section. Beginning witha snow fall the latter part of November, of some three or fourfeet in depth-- and which laid upon the ground for more than twomonths, thus making the roads and trails impassable for anothermonth-- considerable suffering was caused among the Indians anda large loss was sus tained among their flocks and work horses.For approximately three months it was necessary for the reliefwhich was afforded through the Indian Office( in the way offeed distribution) to have the entire time of the greater partof the ind√∫strial force in attending to this work, and in keeping the roads to the different settlements, as well as to therailroad, in a travelable condition. While this worked a considerable hardship upon the Indians, the fact that their flockshave been materially reduced and the wild horses upon the range,which has been a considerable problem to this office, to be almost entirely eradicated, will mean a real benefit to the Indians in future livestock activities. They lost the weakest oftheir flocks and the poorest of their horses. Replacement withgood farm animals has been made in many cases; while our endeavor, if funds can be provided for the purpose, to place better rams under reimbursable regula tions, will mean a better andmore valuable grade of sheep for future use.SECTION IIThe Agency Farmer has prepared a report along extension lines,a copy of which is attached here to as Exhibit" A" showing theagricultural developments here and future activities which it isplanned on carrying to a successful conclusion.One of the most serious of our problems is the securing of employment for the Indians of the village, especially at this time
