stock country, more especially adapted to the raising of sheep
as it affords both winter and summer range, but because of the
lack of water development, in the me sas and the broken country
a full use of the range in these sections cannot be secured.
SECTION I
The past winter has been the most severe known to the older In
dians, or to the old settlers in this section. Beginning with
a snow fall the latter part of November, of some three or four
feet in depth-- and which laid upon the ground for more than two
months, thus making the roads and trails impassable for another
month-- considerable suffering was caused among the Indians and
a large loss was sus tained among their flocks and work horses.
For approximately three months it was necessary for the relief
which was afforded through the Indian Office( in the way of
feed distribution) to have the entire time of the greater part
of the ind√∫strial force in attending to this work, and in keep
ing the roads to the different settlements, as well as to the
railroad, in a travelable condition. While this worked a con
siderable hardship upon the Indians, the fact that their flocks
have been materially reduced and the wild horses upon the range,
which has been a considerable problem to this office, to be al
most entirely eradicated, will mean a real benefit to the Indi
ans in future livestock activities. They lost the weakest of
their flocks and the poorest of their horses. Replacement with
good farm animals has been made in many cases; while our en
deavor, if funds can be provided for the purpose, to place bet
ter rams under reimbursable regula tions, will mean a better and
more valuable grade of sheep for future use.
SECTION II
The Agency Farmer has prepared a report along extension lines,
a copy of which is attached here to as Exhibit" A" showing the
agricultural developments here and future activities which it is
planned on carrying to a successful conclusion.
One of the most serious of our problems is the securing of em
ployment for the Indians of the village, especially at this time
