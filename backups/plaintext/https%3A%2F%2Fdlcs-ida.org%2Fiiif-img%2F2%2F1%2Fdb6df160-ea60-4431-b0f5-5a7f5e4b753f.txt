and returns thom if they got sick and it bac0768 necessaray to send them
home
;
and also sends them home after than have been in school for at
least thr.. years providing they enter school for that length of term.
I would like to have thom enter t'or at least t'ive years, but will con
gode to the vishes of their parents in that matter.
They will be fed, clothed and educated at the expense of the govern
