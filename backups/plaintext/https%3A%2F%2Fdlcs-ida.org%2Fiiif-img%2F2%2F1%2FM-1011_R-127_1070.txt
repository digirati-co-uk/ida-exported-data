Annual Reportpage 3no equipment for giving the boys this instruction. I have received, through theVeterans' Bureau, 120 sets of drawing instruments and it is my plan to place considerable emphasis on this subject this coming school yearVery cordial relations exist between the school and thepublic school authoritiesExtent to which the school has adapted itself to meet theneeds of the Indians. This being an elementary school, our students are not expectedto be prepared to compete with otlher people in different walks of life. Pupils areencouraged to continue in school after completing the work here and thus better preparethemselves to meet competition. ‚Äù Merely a good start in the right airection is about allthat we can expect to give them.Regarding what has been accomplished during the past yearon behalf of the Indians, which to some extent at least, has been more satisfactory thanthe accomplishments of the year preceding, I am unable to state. There has been a veryhearty cooperation on the part of the governors of the Pueblos and the parents of thechildren. We are trying to teach the girls and boys the value of a day' s work and thatthey must earn what they getI have observed no inclination whatever toward intermingling of racesThe total expenditures for the fiscal year just closedwere about the same as for the year precedingThere is practically no playground equipment at theschool and very little supervised play for the girls. The boys engage in all thegames common to schools under the direction of the assistant disciplinarian, who acts.as coach. The girls play tennis, some base ball occasionally, and have calesthenics inthe class rooms. Also setting up exercises every morning in the open air. They havean assembly room in their building and a piano where they enjoy dancing. I reallydo not think the girls from the Pud bdos could stand up under very much athletics
