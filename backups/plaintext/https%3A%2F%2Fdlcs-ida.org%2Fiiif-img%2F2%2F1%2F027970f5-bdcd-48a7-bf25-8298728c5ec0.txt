( a) Health-
The Navajo medicine man is still& power among the Nava jo people
and while the medical work has advanced in usefulness more than ever,
yet, there is much to be done to reach overy family, and it is only
with adequate hospital facilities, Hald nurses, and more physicians that
the influonce of the Indian medicino man can be fully combated and they be
displaced, but the past year has shown a greater patronage of hospitals
and the physicians have made a greater number of visits to homes under
special call than every before. No serious opidemios have visited this
section during the past year and the health of both school and resort
ation has been very good, and the mortality has not been unusual, and the
birth rato exceeds the deaths by quite a margin. It is a very hard task
to keep our census records current owing to the large area over which
those people live and the hundreds of miles necessary to be traveled by
the stockmen in the Mold to keep in touch with every family and keep
records of births and deaths, but it is our endeavor to prosecute this
work whenover other necessary work will penit. The population is
above 7,500.
