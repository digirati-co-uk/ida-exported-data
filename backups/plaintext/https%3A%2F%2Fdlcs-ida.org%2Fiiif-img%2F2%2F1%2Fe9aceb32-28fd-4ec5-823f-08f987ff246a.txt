DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
UNITED STATES INDIAN INSPECTION SERVICE,

Pueblo and Jicarilla Agency, New Mexico.
June 28th.1900.
The Honorable.
The Secretary of the Interior.
Sir:
According to instructions contained in your communication
under date of January 26th, 1900, I have the honor to report the re
sult of my inspection of the Pueblo and Jicarilla Agency, New Mexico.
The Indians of the various Pueblo's receive little from
the Government, they areathe present time industrious and self sup
porting, they are good farmers, many of them have quite large flocks
of sheep and goats.
If the present methods of the white man,
and mexican are allowed to proceed unchecked, the time is not far
distant when these now prosperous Indian will have very little they
can call their own and will be paupers.
I am informed that in the near future this agency is to be
abolished, and the duties as agent of the Pueblo Indians are to be
assumed by Mr.C.J.Crandall, superintendent of the Indian Industrial
School, Santa Fe, this seems to me to be a mistake.
I doubt if there has ever been a time when the Pueblo
Indians needed an agent more than they do at the present time to
look after, and defend their lands and their water rights.
In addition to Mr.Crandall's present duties as superin
tendent of the Santa Fe Indian Industrial School,( with 300 pupils)
he is to have charge of several Pueblo day schools, he will in my
opinion have all the business on his hands he can attend to to make
all these schools a success, if he has to look after the Pueblo Ind
ians, and their many constantly arrising troubles in addition to the
schools under his charge, he will find it a physical impossibility
to attend to all properly, either the schools, or the Pueblo Indians
will be neglected.
