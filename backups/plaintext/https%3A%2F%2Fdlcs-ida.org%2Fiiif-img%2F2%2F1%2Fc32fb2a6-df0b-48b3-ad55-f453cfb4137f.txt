-26discussed* Snake Dance of the Hopis, the ceremony which,whatever it may have once been said of it, is fast deteriorating under the influence of" pop and pop- corn"into a somewhat sordid show.The Hava jos have a number of dances â€¢ the Squaw,Ya ya pai, Pire, and what not, which to thom are beautifuland mean much, but which I have never tried to poe. Thebest of the Nevajos do not relish the idea of permittingthese ceremonies of theirs to become common shows, andare sorry as I am that some of their people are draggingthem out to Fair and Fiesta for a fee. This matter WASbrought up at the last Council, and I told them what isthe Department's attitude about it; that is, that theseceremonies are their om& f fair so long as they do notinterfere with morals, industry, or sanitation.There seens/ be no inmediate disposition on the partof outside groups or associatee to jump deep into save joaffairs. The oil situation has been handled by theDepe rtment so as to evoid any serious criticism, and ilthe health campaign is a continuous one, which givespromise of effectiveness, I am inclined to believe thesegroupe will be satisfied to cooperate Tri Herido anythingin that district. This is the result of rather carefulobservation after conferring with numbers of the representatives of these groups on various occasions duringthe past year. However, if trachoma, in perticular, andhealth conditions generally are not vigorously and continuously and promptly dealt with in& big way by thegovernment, that will, I doubt not, cause the officeabout as much trouble in the not distant future so hasthe Pueblo situation in the recent pas t. Teken in timeby Congress, such an unpleasant contingency can nodoubt be avoided.Purperifreez sarte careA gdagermanTuumuner to the MaraisSeite,
