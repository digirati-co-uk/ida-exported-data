Dr. Dorcester was here in April last, andI am inſonned by the Superintendent that hefavored an additional school building about 44 x60. I am glad to be able to indorse his reconmean dati on in this direction if he made it; butI would go a little further and recommend a twostory brick building about 48 x 70. The necessities of the service here will soon require thisimprovement. A BitableOa Ition for it wouldbe about 30 feet west of the present Schoolbuilding No. 4. The building can be a veneeredbrick structure, but kiln burned brick and not taxthe pressed article shoul be used.I also recommend the camp E tion of theaiоbe building( No. 13) in the narn or mentioned.RECOME DATIONSThe purchase of two heavy road wagons,3 1/ 4 inchskin withstrong California break.The haulingof wood andstone to this school isfrom 15 to 25 miles andstrong wagons are neededfor the purpose. The ones now used are too weak.The purchase of an additional O gan farthe school, Esteyor D ne other good make. One ofthese now here is an old Pilton argan andSn notfit D be used. The other is a fairly good organ;thereshould be cood organs.
