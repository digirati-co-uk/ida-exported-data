Dear sirs:
I inolose herowith vouchers and shook for$ 6.29 in
payment
for the brass coat and vest buttons
as per your bili,
which is inclosed
also.
will
you please make out a new bill
to correspond
exactly with the vouchers
, as the Government
does
not allow me to pay the express charges separately
; and let the
bill be and the vouchers
be receipted
by one member of the firem
in his own name only- 1t would necessitate
an extra certificate
if the receipt was made in the firm name.
Very
truly
yours
,
Ceard
Superintendent
.
melosed anvelope is for
return of vouchers.
