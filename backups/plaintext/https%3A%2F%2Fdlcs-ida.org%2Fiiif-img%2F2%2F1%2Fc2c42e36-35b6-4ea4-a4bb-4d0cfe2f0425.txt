My dsey Sir:-
Replying to your kind favor of the 7th. inst. I will say.
I find here in Santa Fe a large variety of so called Aztec pottery at
quits low rates. One man
offers four pieces quite large-( 3 to 5 gali
for$ 9.50 for the four or$ 7.00 for three of them f.0.0.
They are rough and a little chipped at the top. I have no dount but tha
are genuine, at least they are ugly enough to be very ancient.
I find at another place
a good variety of Aztes and* Clif- dweller"
pottery, very perfset and guaranteed genuine at from$ 5 to$ 35 each.
These are rather small. The largest would hold no more than 1/2 gal.
He has other pieces said to be very fine running up to$ 500 each.
I know nothing or the real value of these things and there is no KRS
an interested party of whom I can
connoisseur in the city who is not
inguirs. It seems to me that the more ugly the pieces the higher the
you
pricos.
I will gladly do any thing I can for you and in case
should conclude to order from this meager statement, I can have the game
goods on the car the day your order is received, â€¢
I am most truly yours. at command. Nitrite,
Superintendent.
