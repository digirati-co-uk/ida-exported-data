------ Law and Order.
The pupils of the school have not been guilty of any infract
ion of the laws of the state or nation during the year. It was
reported that two boys were at one time under the influence of
liquor, but they denied it and it was impossible to obtain convin
cing evidence.
S01
The Indians of the southwest generally are a hard working,
law- abiding people, who cause but little trouble. The Lagunas are
anxious to have their children educated; the Acomas and Santa Anas
are quite favorable to schools; the Isletas, Sandies and San
Felipes, are less favorable to schools, but many members of these
three bands desire to have their children attend school. Wucation
is growing in favor with all of these Indians, but the Lagunas will
exert themselves more than any other band in order to keep their
children in school.
