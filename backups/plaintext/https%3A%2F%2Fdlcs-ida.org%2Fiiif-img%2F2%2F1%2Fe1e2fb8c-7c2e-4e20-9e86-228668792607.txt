1- 3-each year, trying to make both ends meet and keep theschool running efficiently.The playgrounds for the boys and girls are usedconstantly when the pupils are at liber ty, and do a greatdeal of good to the pupils. The campus is we 11 lei√∞out with trees, shrubs and flowers, and I do not hesitateto state that our grounds or campus is one of the prettiestin this section of the country. We have a greenhousein which we place the flowers during the cold weather.If it were not for the Indian school here thereare over 1500 Indian children who would never see the inside of a schoolhouse. The state authorities, in mostcases, do not enforce school attendance upon Indians.Also the families ro am about considerably and do not stayany place long enough to allow their children to attendschool. Most of the families prefer to have theirchildre nattend the Government school so that the childrencan pursue their studies and the parents can continue tomake their living among the lumber camps, fishing or berrypicking, etc., without dragging their children along withthem. Of course, the school is small for the numbereligible to attend it, e nd ma rty prospective pupils haveto be refused admission, but many receive much benefit.Onsidering the attitude of the state and county authorities to ward attendance of Indian children and consideringthe number of eligible children in Michigan I am of theopinion that the school should continue in operation for anumber of years yet, possibly fifteen or twenty years atleast. To abolish this school would be a calamity tothe Indians of Michigan. Ma ny w ould grow up without anyschooling whatever under present existing conditions.2002 Ch 2 dadie, to
