ROTA ANNUAT,
ANNUAL NARRATIVE REPORT
1928
101
Jicarilla Indian Agency
Section 6
Sales
No patents in fee nor certificates of competency have been issued
to members of this tribe. The Jicarilla Apache realize that with
the issue of patent in fee there comes additional responsibilities
for which the majority of the tribe are not yet fitted. The
individual stock industry necessitates the land being held intact
which cannot be done if patents in fee are issued, or the land
of deceased Indians sold to others than members of the tribe. Water
is one of the most important factors in the sheep industry and
is not easily obtainable on many of their allottments. Shoula
the land with water thereon, which controls a certain grazing area
around it, pass from the control of these Indians, disaster would
certainly follow in their stock industry.
The Dutch Reform Mission, located at the Agency, has the use of
10 acres of land set aside for them. This plot of ground is
recognized by the General Land Office but no patent has been issued.
All trust patents have been issued and practically all estates
have been probated of Indians who died prior to June 30, 1927.
Approximately,$ 12,000.00 of ind ividual Indian money is on deposit.
Most of this money comes from the division of estates and will be
paid out or used for the benefit of Indians within the next few
months which will materially reduce the deposit of individual
Indian money.
