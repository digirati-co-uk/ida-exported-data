the rule. The strength of the pueblos rests in their incomparable passivity. They are crystalized units of longtenure and happy adaptation to environment, primitivejewels in the rough, not offering so much for change andassimilation as for study, polish, and emulation.Historical record dates with the first exploration ofCoronado in 1540. Missionaries accompanying the earlyexplorers gave the Pueblos the Spanish language and theiridentification with the Catholic church. Difficulty in dealing with community governments and people they little understood prompted the Spanish Decree of 1620 directing theannual election in each New Mexico Pueblo, of a governor,lieutenant- governor, alcalde, fiscales, andother necessary officers, without interferenceSpanishof state or church, but to be followed byDecreeconfirmation by representative of the crown1620and annual presentation of the silver- headedcane to the governor as insignia of office,and with it the support and authority suchconfirmation assured. The office seeks the man; there is noelectioneering and no emoluments. The several pueblos havefollowed the Royal Decree for 300 years and, with few exceptions, over 4000 elections and installations have resultedand comparatively without change, trouble or dispute, savethat unfortunately the ceremony of confirmation has been discontinued.The native priesthood was the controlling factor inPueblo government before the Royal Decree and the caciquesare yet strong in council, leaders in the annual selection,election and installation, and masters of dance and ceremony.They are chosen from clan selection andseniority rather than from heredity. TraPuebloditionalism compels their quiet life. TheyPriesthoodseldom leave the pueblo; they are generallyrespected as center of power, direction andinstruction. There is disposition among theyoung to deprecate the cacique and the priesthood, yet tradition, custom and culture that has come down through the agessheltered with the clan. Some may se em dull, greedy, and maybe stupid, but there is limit to the degeneracy or inefficiencyof the cacique as with other leaders in government. He has tokeep his grip on the community mind. He can not go beyond whatthe people will stand, either toward darkness or toward thelight. His authority in leadership after all rests on thepersuasion that his activities and administrations are propitious.
