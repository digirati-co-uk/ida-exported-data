To what extent has the school adapted itself to meneeds of the Indians? I can do no better than to repeat herewhat I wrote in my 192l report. h What the Indian girls most needto know is something of improved methods in cooking, housework,home care of the sick, and sanitation or general preventive measures with regard to epidemics, diseases, etc. Our pupils allC one from plant- producing communities, so that what the boys, asa general rule, most need is something of improved methods infarming, gardening, and the care and breeding of far m animalsThose lines are what we have laid greatest emphasis upon withouthowever neglecting to give appropriate instruction in such relatedindustrial lines as carpentry, blacksmithing shoe and harness respairing, plumbing and steamfitting, steam heating, electricalwiring, etc. In this way, we aim to fit a boy so that whetherhe goes back to the pueblo after leaving school for good, orwhether he detaches himself from the Indian community and goesout into the wide world to make a living, he can make good.
