MOIANAFF,â‚¬ OF INDIAN2- Education Division- sohools section. Mt. Pleasant* RECEIVEDJUL201910the lumbermen move, and in the summertime they go berry pickingfor weeks at a time, so that the time left for sending their boysand girls to school is very scarce indeed.We have found the course of study for the Michigan publicschools to be very adaptable to our eight grados in the Indianschool and think it an excellent plan to use it, then when a pupilgraduates here, if he cares to go on farther in his education, hewi11 fit into the next grade in the publio school.Five pupils graduated from our school this year, three girlsand two boys. Two of the girls have positions for the summer doinghousework in two of the best families in the city, the third girlgoes to her home. Both of the boys intend to remain and continuetheir education,- one will attend high school next year, while theother will complete his course in engineering here at the school.The industrial training given in this school for the girlsand boys is of the most practical nature. The girls are taughthousekeeping, laundry Work, sewing and cooking. The girls in thedomestic science class are taught how to cook meals for a smallfamily, while those working in the hospital learn the simple andnecessary things to be done in caring for the sick. The boys atthis gshool are taught the following trades,- carpentering, tailoringengineering, baking and farming.The greatest need of this school is a new dormitory and homefor the small boys in order to relieve the congested condition inthe boys' home at the present time.
