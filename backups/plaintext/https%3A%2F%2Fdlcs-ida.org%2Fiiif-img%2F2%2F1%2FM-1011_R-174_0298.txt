| 1A jail building is also needed at the Agency.Taking conditions into consiu eration this is a necessity.For the purpose we have, thus far, been using a little tworoon stone building, the walls of which are layed up in amud portar and the roof also being of dirt. It is verysmall, unsanitary, and will hold anyone who chooses tobreak out.Employees positions now on the agency roster tseconsidered sufficient for the needs of the agency, werewe able to keep the positions filled with fairly competentpeople, For some time past seventy- five percent of thepositions have been vacant. For a considerable portion ofthe time it has been found impossible to even keep temporary employed in the positions.Little difficulty is experienced in keeping orderupon the reservation.There has been no crime s or offenses committed bythe Indians of the reservation, Minor offenses are hand ledpart of the time by the local government of the Indians andpart of the time by the Superintendent.The stealing of stock belonging to Indians is stiligoing on to the south of the reservation to some extent,though not to the extent that has existed formerly. It wi11be a di fii cult metter to stop this altogether.- 3-
