Page 19NARRATIVE.Annual report- 1915Section V1- Field Irrigation.But very little has been done in the way of irrigationon this reservation. A few dry reservoirs and ditches werebuilt some few years ago which have been of no use to theIndians. The only method of securing water is by floods andmelting snow. Large wells might be sunk to advantage andpumps installed for irrigation at some points. The Reclamationpart of the Indian Service now has under construction aproject at Gunado, Arizona, which will ultimately irrigate someIndian land. Some irrigation is done from Red Lake and thisproject should be extended. The School and Agency farm was.greatly extended and improved during the year.
