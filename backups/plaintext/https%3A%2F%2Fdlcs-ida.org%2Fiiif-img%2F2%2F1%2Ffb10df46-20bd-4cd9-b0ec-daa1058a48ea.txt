Section 4
Population
The advancement of these Indians is not yet far enough along for
them to fully understand the purpose of business organizations for
the furtherance of their industrial, moral and political activities
particularly by electing their own leaders and a policy has been
established to select for them the most substantial man in each
community and direct them and thru their influence, have them
direct the others.
No cash payment of funds has been made these Indians but sheep
issues from time to time, amounting in all to$ 716.00 per individ
ual, have been made to most of the Jicarilla Apache. Fortunately,
they have never asked for cash payment from their timber funds
since the tribe in general believe that the issue of sheep, which
will provide them employment and income for the necessities of
life, is the most satisfactory method for the distribution of
their funds. The large number who have made good in the sheep
industry proves the wisdom of their decision in this matter.
