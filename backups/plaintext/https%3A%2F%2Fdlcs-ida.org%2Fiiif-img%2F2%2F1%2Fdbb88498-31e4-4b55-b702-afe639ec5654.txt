traoboma operations, 1800 dispensary cases, 219 treated
in hospital, 300 examined for diseases, six births.
" Additional medical personnel is needed to carry
on the health work in this jurisdiction. One dootor
is needed and several other nurses could be used to ad
vantage. One doctor could easily take up all his time
by devoting it to the schools and hospital. A reser

ed to care for reservation practice, and this hospital
should be equipped for the treatment of tuberculosis.
I find that the majority of the Indians who are suffer
ing with this disease do not want to leave the reser
vation for treatment and prefer taking chances of getting
well at home. A small tubercular hospital or reservation
hospital with a tubercular annex would answer the purpose.
