OF INDinaAsBEOFHEIVEDA.JUL11910BUSINESS DEPARTMENTContinued progress characterizes the work of theBusiness Department. As we stated when this work was first organized, it is our aim to make it of twofold value: first, togive to all the students in the four upper grades of the academicdepartment drill and training in the fundamentals of good businessin the preparation of ordinary business forms, in accurate andtactful correspondence, and in the elements of bookkeeping;second, to train a selected number of young men and young womenas clerks, stenographers, and bookkeepers, who can, immediatelyon the completion of the course, take positions either in theGovernment Service or in the business world. Through the cooperation of the Civil Service Commission, an examination was givento those in the advanced classes, in which they did well. Duringthe past summer the advanced students have been given practicaltraining in the actual office work of administration here at theschool.In this work we are not striving for numbers, nor to makea spectacular display, but it is felt that, because of the carefulselection of the students, and with the very thorough and comeprehensive training which is given them, those who are graduatedwi11l be competent, and capable of earning a good 1ivelihood attheir chosen vocation.
