4.1930.NARRATIVE SECTIONSCHOOLS.SEC. 3.EASTERN NAVAJO JURISDICTION.There are no public schools within reach of the Nava jos of thisjurisdiction. One day school is maintained at Pinedale for the Indian children of that locality, with an enrollment of 22 children.It is not possible to operate day schools among the Navajo Indians as there are few places where Indian families live close enoughto patronize day schools. At Pinedale some of the little childrenmust come a distance as much as four miles, and in our opinion theboarding schools should be made THE School for them, with ample equipment. I would suggest that small boarding schools be encouraged inthe Indian country so located as to be a community center for thatsection of country and the children educated as near home as possible.The transfer should be a matter for serious consideration and suchtransfers be made more selective, rather a matter of quality students,than a mass of them. The non- reservation schools have been permittedto enlarge, with enrollments above 800 and even a thousand, and thework of the reserva tion schools is often disorganized thru wholesaletransfer of children.The farm has furnished an abundance of cabbage, squash, onions,carrots, parsnips, green beans, green corn in season, and beets,which give a very good variety of food in addition to that furnishedon Annual Estimate.The relationship between employees, parents, children and withfellow employees has in the main been very good. Occasionally appointments are made of people who do not try to fit into Indian Servicework. It is entirely impossible to give assistance to all returnedstudents by way of employment, as this isolated desert country offersno opportunity in any industry other than the raising of livestock,and with an unfortunate range condition, the outlook in this respectis uninviting. In my opinion an employment bureau established atAlbuquerque and other suitable places, with a view of providing information as to various classes of work adaptable for the returned student, would be of great benefit.The Rehoboth school, operated by the Christian Reformed Church,has been doing very creditable work up to and including eighth grade.The Farmington Methodist Boarding School is also a school of high staning.The Eastern Navajo Boarding School enrolls many new beginnerseach year and tries to put them thru the sixth grade, but this is notalways possible on account of the requirements of having to transferto the non- reservation schools, these being replaced by new ones fromthe Indian country. Text books and course of study as now followedseem to be very well fitted to the Indian pupil. Boys receive instruction in farming, gardening, construction, health, livestock industry,while the girls receive home training, cooking, laundering, sewing andweaving
