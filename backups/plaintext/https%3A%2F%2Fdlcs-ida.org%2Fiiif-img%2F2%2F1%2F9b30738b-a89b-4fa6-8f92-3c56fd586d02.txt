The Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
WASHINGTON.
Sir:
AFFAIRS
card 830
for
I have the honor to transmit herewith the stadkotital sectionnar.
See
of
census
of the Moqui Anmial Report for 1917.
I regret the delay in the transmission of this report;
but as 18
probably known, a large part of the computation cannot be accurately
made until after the close of Cash and Property Accounts, when expend
itures and balances are learned.
The Narrative section of the Report
will be forwarded by first mail after completion.
The Moqui office
has two clerks' positions vacant, which reduction of clerical force
tends to handicap correspondence and report making at this time.
Respectory
Superintendent.
