The Hoating
System
, is hy wood and soal stoves
, and is as good as
can be had by this system
,
The lighting
or the school
is by kerosene
oil lamps, and is as good as
can be had of the kind,
A new school
building
for school rooms Chapel
, and exerciso
room is
greatly
needed
" which to increase
th·ªç capacity
of the school from
250 to 350 pupils
.
The rooms in the Main Building
now usod for school work, can be very
andeply made into domnitori...
Or account of the continual increase in pupils( I rorusod admittance
more than 50 last yoar) the lonst that should be appropriated
for
this building is$ 20,000.00
In, the construction
of the Employes Buliding, the original plans call?
for piazzas on the East and south sidos; This will require piazzas
about 120 tot in length, and by constructing the same with the school
be done for$ 400.00, which includes all lumber, materials
er work.
Is W204 a great improvon ont to the looks of the building, and will
ba a grout benefit to the foundation by protecting it from the sovere
rains.
" A"
por safety, comfort and in the end economy, this school should be
ligbird by electricty. A plant for the sams in connection with a steam
heating piant for all necessary buildinge, would cost loss here than in
the schools, on atseount of the buildings so close to togezer
