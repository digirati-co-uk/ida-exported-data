Annual Report.Schools- 5.Santa Fe Schooland Agency.nance of a day school, and that it would be a matter of wellplaced economy to abolish this school, observation of theschool and situation at Nambe during the past year convincesme that there is no prospect for an increase in attendance,unless a site should be condemned and a school buildingerected at a point midway between the upper and lower puebloBettlements, I believe that the slight increase whidh mightthus be gained would not be large enough to warrant the expenditure of this money.. The children enrolled at the Nambeschool could be placed in the Santa Fe Boarding School withlittle inconvenience, and it is my opinion that, in view ofall the circumstances, it would be a matter of economicadministration to abolish this school,The water situation at San IldefonBo is bad, Thewell is only listen feet deap, and is 111led from surfaceseepage, which makes it unfit for drinking purposes, Myinformation is that this well hae not been used for drinking purposes since shortly subsequent to its completion,It is hoped that it may be possible to provido a dril dwell at San Ildefonso, and drilled wells at the other dayschools at an early date, Reconnmendations to this end havebeen under considoration in the office during the past year,and it is very essential that funds may be found to do thiswork.
