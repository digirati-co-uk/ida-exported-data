San Juan School& Agency.
It has been impossible to assign other districts because of
lack of quarters. This difficulty will soon be overcome through
establishment of quarters at Red Rock and at Tocito.
One of the farmers has been located here at the agency where
he has been in charge of the agency farm of 100 acres.
This farmer
has assisted the Indians on their farms scattered along the San
Juan River adjacent to the agency, and will be much needed from
now on, in the supervision of Indian farming on the ten- acre
tracts on the mesa near the school, under the Hogback ditch
project.
During the spring, the services of three of the farmers
were utilized in a thorough dipping of the Indian sheep for
the eradication of scabies,
The work of the farmers on this reservation includes
practical assistance rendered the Indians in the inprovements
of their flumes and ditches and in their work of grading, ditching,
plowing, cultivating, planting, harvesting, as well as practical
advice and assistance in the handling of their sheep and cattle.
The market facilities open to the Indians are provided by the
licensed traders on the reservation as well as the trading posts
scattered along the reservation and outside the line. Generally
speaking, the Navajoes are shrewd traders and the majority of them
are not easily taken advantage of.
