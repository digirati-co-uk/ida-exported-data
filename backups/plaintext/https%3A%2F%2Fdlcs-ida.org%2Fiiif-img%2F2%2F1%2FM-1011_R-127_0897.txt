Of coyrse if we take into consideration the fact thatthis school does not take pupils any higher than theequivalent of the eight grades of the" common school,it may readily be seen that a graduate of this chool isbut meagerly equipped for a life struggle in this dayand age Most of the pupils who have been graduatedfrom this school have been compelled, on account of parental objection, to cease their schooling then and therealthough, had their parents' consent been given, theymight easily have all been transferred to Haskell orsome other school carrying two to four years of workin advance of what is given here This, of course,isa situation which will have to be worked out in timeFor the girl graduate who is not permitted togo any farther than the highest grade of this school,there is little for her to look forward to except toreturn to her pueblo home or accept domestic servicein some family in the city. But with the boys, it isdifferent Even with the training received here,anyboy can go out and get a job as a mechanic, ora.farm assistant, or something that will bring him ina good income. And many of our boy graduates aredoing just that. Some, on the other hand, are tillingtheir own ground at their pueblo homes and making adecent living, although their actual cash income perannum may be rather meagerIn June of this year we had the largest graduating class in the history of the school, 14 in all,seven boys and seven girls They finished the JuniorVocational course them, and a gratifying number of themembers of the class wil continue their work next fallin Haskell, or Riverside or s ome other school givingwork in the regular Vocationan CourseAt the close of the regular sessi on June 9,it was found that of the four hundred pupils who hadstayed in to the close of school year, about 65 weredefiâ‚¬ient in their work and had to be either conditioned or failed VWe conducted a" summer school" offour weeks for those pupils, with the result that 41of those who had boen found deficient made good thedeficiency and were given unqualified promotionAs regards the books on the" authorized list,"I may say that all that we have used have been foundsatisfactoryThe industrial traingng for both boys and girlshas followed pretty closely the lines laid dowm inthe Revised Course of Styray of 1927, with the single excep.tion that we are a little weak in the subject of Masonry.However, even so, the boys get a good deal of instructionincidentally from our carpentry department in concrete
