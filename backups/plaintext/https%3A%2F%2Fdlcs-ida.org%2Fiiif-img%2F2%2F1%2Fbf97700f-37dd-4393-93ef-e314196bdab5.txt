Dear
Wis8
Busby
:
In reply to your lottor of this date, I will say, that
an instruction in musio has bogn ordered by the Indian Orries, a
Murie Teacher has been sent here for that purpos..
I tried to arrango to have this instruetion during the time of the
regular meeting of the oldegon, but a most of the teachers did not
1. Úce to part with this time from their work, I on consultation with
the Principal foacher, sonal udad to tak. the time outside of these
hours: when the rooms were not required by the teachers.
I imagined that this was agrocable to all concerned, and am pained
to see that it is not so rith you.
There are no class rooms in this school with closed doors", but I
insis* that each teacher while in charge of her clası, shall have
nintorypted control of pupils and room.
this in no way provents visitor from looking on, but as 20 minutos
ls all that this teacher has for the two alassos in your room, I
desire at least for a while- that she be uninterupted in her work
for this time, oven by visitors.
You are mistaken if you imagine that I in anywry desire to obstruet
or restrain your entire control or your om elassos during your houri,
