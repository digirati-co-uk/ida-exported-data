I would suggest that this amount npy be raised as follow

I would further reommend that the positions or shoe- maker And Assist
ant Matron, be abolished after the 15th of May. These position hay
de abolished after the date raneo 6: 2 July 1st. without materially
afloating the management of the school.
This would then leave to be applied on tne erection of buildingu$ 242
This vould still leave a balance, c 41020se the building, o≈•$ 1.51.6%
which I suggest be paid from the fud on hand for the pay on regular
employes, and the remainder be paid them pro rata.
If there is any other way by which the vilbing may be enclosed and
made habitable for next year, I* should like to be tn'ormed at once.
It is absolutely necessary for the welfare of the schood what this
building bo occupied next year. It is needed for a hospital; it is ne
ea
ed for employeg quarters. It would be poor economy to allow it to
stand uncompleted until a future Congress appropriates money for its con
pletion. I ask meediate instructions in regard to the matter.
very respectfully,
Superintendent.
