Our Freshmen Year
Our first year of high school was
exemplary. We watched our school
become exemplary through excellent
academics, athletics and
extracurricular activities. We settled
into our first year of high school and
enjoyed the many new activities such
as Homecoming and the Chaco Canyon
Trip. We enjoyed making new friends
and becoming acquainted again with
old friends. We learned that high
school is fun and are ready for new
challenges next year.
