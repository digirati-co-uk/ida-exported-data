To all my coaches, thanks for believing in me, RIP Rodney Coles and to all my teachers,thanks for the lessons and support throughout the years. It' s been years. Friends have come andgone, some by transferring and some with the time, but life goes on. Though it' s hard to realize it,but it' s a constant fight, and it' s hard not to blow up, take a deep breath and go on with it. Nothingis going to be handed to you. You have to work for it. To football and track, don' t slack during practice. It' s a sacrifice, for the game. Once again, thank you everyone for the love and support you haveshown me. Anyone I may have forgotten I' m sorry, but to those reading this, good luck with whateveryou do in life, and remember to keep breathing.65g-- Robert Honwah90 2011- 2012
