Mr. H. D. Roinkin,
Watrous, N. Vox.
Daar sir:
I am anxious to give the pupils a littl. variety during
the Christmas Holidays, and would be much pleased if you can arrang.
to substitute some nice, young lean pork in the place or boog.
I think about 300 pounds of pork will be all that we requir., and
you may charge us the equivalent in value of beef.
Please let me know if you can make this arrangement and greatly
obligo.
Vory truly yours.
Alicte
Superintendent.
