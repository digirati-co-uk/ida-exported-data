00" A"The work as I carried it out this year was in thenature of an experiment. I was asked to try and carryout an activity program in the two upper levels, G and H.An activity program had never been tried in these levelsbefore. I was allowed to lay out my own program and usemy own judgement. However, I talked over many of theproblems with my principal.As to the value of this experiment I am scarcelyprepared to say as yet, since a year is too short a timeto judge, I tried to give the children an interestingand well- rounded program, bearing in mind their futurereservation needs. Ã‘ever the less, certain fundamentalsthat are considered ussential were not overlooked.In outlining the work for the year in these twolevels, I tried to set up a list of desirable objectivesand activities to meet the needs of this particular school.I did not feel bound by any traditional rules, so Iattempted to fit the program to the child. Units werechosen and worked out with these questions in mindAre these units practical? Have they any future value?If the old time- honored methods no longer seem to fitour situation what should be substituted that will bebetter?No attempt was made to throw out methods, materials,,and such, just because they were old. They were merelyquestioned as to their value. If any of these were inharmony with the program as outlined they were retained.The emphasis in the work was on the needs of the Navajochildren themselves. Practical results were sought.Progress levels G and I were mentioned in the firstparagraph. Let me explain these. When the committeeon ourriculum making started making the new curriculumlast year, it was decided to change the old system ofdesignating stages of progress from grades to progresslevels. This was done mainly to get the idea of failureout of the minds of the children. If they had to goback to a lower level it did not seem to have quite thesame stigma of failure as under the grade system.-1
