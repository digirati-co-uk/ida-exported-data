" A"
The work as I carried it out this year was in the
nature of an experiment. I was asked to try and carry
out an activity program in the two upper levels, G and H.
An activity program had never been tried in these levels
before. I was allowed to lay out my own program and use
my own judgement. However, I talked over many of the
problems with my principal.
As to the value of this experiment I am scarcely
prepared to say as yet, since a year is too short a time
to judge, I tried to give the children an interesting
and well- rounded program, bearing in mind their future
reservation needs. Ã‘ever the less, certain fundamentals
that are considered ussential were not overlooked.
In outlining the work for the year in these two
levels, I tried to set up a list of desirable objectives
and activities to meet the needs of this particular school.
I did not feel bound by any traditional rules, so I
attempted to fit the program to the child. Units were
chosen and worked out with these questions in mind
Are these units practical? Have they any future value?
If the old time- honored methods no longer seem to fit
our situation what should be substituted that will be
better?
No attempt was made to throw out methods, materials,,
and such, just because they were old. They were merely
questioned as to their value. If any of these were in
harmony with the program as outlined they were retained.
The emphasis in the work was on the needs of the Navajo
children themselves. Practical results were sought.
Progress levels G and I were mentioned in the first
paragraph. Let me explain these. When the committee
on ourriculum making started making the new curriculum
last year, it was decided to change the old system of
designating stages of progress from grades to progress
levels. This was done mainly to get the idea of failure
out of the minds of the children. If they had to go
back to a lower level it did not seem to have quite the
same stigma of failure as under the grade system.
