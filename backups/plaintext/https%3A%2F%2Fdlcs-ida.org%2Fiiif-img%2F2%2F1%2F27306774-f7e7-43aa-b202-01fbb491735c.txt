The curriculum as completed so far is deficientin boys industrial or vocational work. However due to theages of our pupils this is not a too serious deficiency.We do need to do more for our boys, though, in giving themvocational training. At the present time, this school ishandicapped by the lack of an industrial shop, and a boysvocational instructor. We need a good program of agricultural training. Even with a good instructor( which we lack)this school could not carry on a well rounded program ofagricultural training, since the growing season is duringthe summer months, when the pupils are all at their homes.Therefore it is advocated, that this school be permitted tooperate at any time during the year that its work can mostefficiently be performed. The work, also, would be carriedon at any convenient place, which lends itself most efficiently to advancing the training of the Navajo people.We propose as soon as facilities are avellable, and as soon as theschool year is ad justed to our growing season, to have agricultural plots, in various localities. These plots will be80 chosen as to give the pupils practice in carrying onagriculture such as found in this part of the country. Weneed to carry on demonstrationsof dry farming, and irrigation methods. The se demonstration plots, must from necessity be some miles from our school. Therefore truck transportation must be made available before we can accomplishthis work successfully. This demonstration and experimentalwork would be carried out on school plots first; then as fastas the parents become interested, and willing to cooperate,this work would take place on the land of the adult Indians.As a part of the Navajo study of the most effective use of the land, we plan to include work in erosion control, and forestry in our school curriculum during the comingyear.We plan to make an effort to include in our agricultural work, some instruction on better methods in sheepraisingSince we do not have special instructors, our onlyrecourse, in boys vocational work, is to have our regularteachers study with the children, in order to put this workacrossMuch of the agricultural, grazing, forestry, anderosion control subject matter is not aveilable in a formsuitable for pupil use. We have no librarian at this school.Since we are trying to put over a program of education adaptedto Navajo needs, we feel that a combination position of librarian and research worker, and collector of educational materialfor teaching purposes is needed for this school. Probably thisposition can not be created at once. Therefore we believe that
