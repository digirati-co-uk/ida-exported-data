Washington, DC.
Sir:-
I most respectfully request authority to expend a sum not exceed
ins$ 45.00 in the open market purchase of ducks, geese and turkeys as
follows.-
$ 1.00 each
24 ducks, at not to exceed
8 Gouse,
2 Turkeys,
$ 24,00
16.00
5,00
$ 45,00
This investment of$ 45.00 I consider the most advisable.
whe Pueblo children should be taught the care of such fowls, and
* 6ch Pueblo as a stream of water running through it, the raising
of these fowls by them would be profitabla.
There is now a large pond at the school, with a capacity of over
16,000 barrels, and in every way, things are suitable for the proper
handling of ducks and geese.
The cost for feeding them will be nothing, as sufficient crumbs
are gathered from the tables every day for this purpose.
I respectfully ask your favorable consideration of this request,
Very respectfully,
Your obedient servant.
A.Hities
superintendunt.
