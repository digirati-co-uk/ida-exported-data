gardens. In the pueblo, as in all of the northern pueblos,

garden culture. The peculiar mountain location gives Nembe
the most favorable rainfall of any pueblo, with possible
exceptions of Taos and Picuris.
Recent construction of a diversion weir and high line
canal for this pueblo has given them first water for their
cultivable areas. Their grazing areas are limited and
livestock industry las little promise for this pueblo.
