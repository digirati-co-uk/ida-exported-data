San Juan School and Agency.
The course of study has been kept in the foreground during
the year and every effort made to follow it.
Plans have been laid
for a more determined effort to along this line the coming year.
There are approximately two thousand children without school
facilities on this reservation.
A thorough, comprehensive industrial training for both boys
and girls is given at this school.
Such training for the boys includes practical work in carpentry
and blacksmithing, as well as on the farm and in the orchards, garden
and vineyard. Boys are also given practical instruction and work
in the dairy and with sheep and poultry.
The girls are given detailed, systematic instruction and
pratical training in cooldng, housekeeping and sewing and in the
hospital and laundry.
Particular emphasis is laid on their instruction and train
ing in housekeeping and in the care and preparation of fruits
and vegetables for winter use.
The girls at this school, under
the direction of the matron and cook each year can and dry
hundreds of gallons of fruit and hundreds of pounds of vegetables.
This work, aside from the practicable training which it
affords the girls, results in a substantial and much appreciated
addition to the children's tablo during the winter months.
