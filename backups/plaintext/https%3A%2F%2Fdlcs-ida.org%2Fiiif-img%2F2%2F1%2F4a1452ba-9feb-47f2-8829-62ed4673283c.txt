7.The expense of operatingthe school has been much morethan any previous year, because everythingwe heve had to buyhas cost more than ever before and because every employeehasreceivedan increasein pay of ten dollars a month. Because ofpoor yields on the farm we have had to buy nearly all our provisions, flour and meal.We put up some pretty good home made play ground apparatus during the year, which has been used very much. Host ofthis was for the use of the boys. The girls have only someswings and a basket ball court. Some slides and other apparatus should be purchasedfor the use of the girls. A gynnasium would be a great help to this school. Our Park isquite Ã  help during the summer season. Here the boys playbase ball and the lake hes several boats on it where rowingis enjoyed by quite a number.If the present policy be adhered to, schools must bekept up for three or four generationsto come. There isnothinghere to bring in white people and the presentgeneration of Indians will not heintainschools themselves. Itis doubtfulif the next two or three generationswill thinkenough of schools to mainta in them. The States will not e8tablishschools exolusivelyfor Indian pupils.18.
