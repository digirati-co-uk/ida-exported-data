Accout of work done during the year 0933-1934.
Most of the entire years work was based on the work at
the Hogan. I called the Unit" Indian Home Life," because I
wished to stress the things they need at home. We brought in
the home life of other Indians as a comparisan to their own
homes and lives. I wished to develop in them, a friendly feel
ing toward other people, so they might have a sense of appre
ciation of the work of others.
The Hogan was started by the suggestion of the children.
I had hoped that we might have some such activity, because
we did not hava a suitable classroom. It was not our inten
tion at first to use it as a classroom all the time.
We had
planned that we could go to the Hogan certain periods of the
day, when we so desired. Circumstances made it necessary to
use it all the time, so later we called it" our Hogan School."
I believe the children liked their Hogan, because
they had made it. They really thought that it belonged to
them. Some of them suggested that they would like to go to
school there next year, because they had made the Hogan.
Most of the work that was done during the year was
taken up because we really felt a need for having it or
doing it. I feel that there was really very little of an
artificial nature. Some of the things we did the children
did not really see the reason for having at the time, but
later they seem to realize they were necessary. I have
reference to such things as windows in the hogan etc.
