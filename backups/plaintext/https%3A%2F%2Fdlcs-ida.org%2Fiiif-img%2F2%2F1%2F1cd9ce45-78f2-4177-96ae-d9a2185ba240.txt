evel E- 20Accout of work done during the year 0933-1934.Most of the entire years work was based on the work atthe Hogan. I called the Unit" Indian Home Life," because Iwished to stress the things they need at home. We brought inthe home life of other Indians as a comparisan to their ownhomes and lives. I wished to develop in them, a friendly feeling toward other people, so they might have a sense of appreciation of the work of others.The Hogan was started by the suggestion of the children.I had hoped that we might have some such activity, becausewe did not hava a suitable classroom. It was not our intention at first to use it as a classroom all the time.We hadplanned that we could go to the Hogan certain periods of theday, when we so desired. Circumstances made it necessary touse it all the time, so later we called it" our Hogan School."I believe the children liked their Hogan, becausethey had made it. They really thought that it belonged tothem. Some of them suggested that they would like to go toschool there next year, because they had made the Hogan.Most of the work that was done during the year wastaken up because we really felt a need for having it ordoing it. I feel that there was really very little of anartificial nature. Some of the things we did the childrendid not really see the reason for having at the time, butlater they seem to realize they were necessary. I havereference to such things as windows in the hogan etc.
