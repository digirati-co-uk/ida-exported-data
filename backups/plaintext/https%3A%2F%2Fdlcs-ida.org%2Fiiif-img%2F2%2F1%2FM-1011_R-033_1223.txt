EASTERN NAVAJO JURISDICTION.
No tribal herds are maintained for the benefit of the Indians,
tho they are induced to purchase better rams and Billies for im
provement of their flooks of sheep and goats. Fifty purebred Angoras
were purchased last year, in part reimbursable, and at present some
om very well improved flocks of both sheep and goats.
The four stookmen now employed work among the Indians in their
respective districts, supervising dipping operations, giving assist
ance with chapter organizations and the details. Taking Census,
and attempting to enroll births and note any deaths which have 00
curred since the Census was taken. They also give attention to
health matters, bringing in patients in need of medical attention
and numerous other duties. At present there are above 200 Navajos
employed by the Santa Fe Railroad at several camps replacing steel
and putting in new ties. This work will only provide work for three
or four months. Others are employed in logging and lumber camps, but
not many on public road construction. one or two section gangs on
the Santa Fe are all Navajo Indians.
Work during the winter is slack as all construction work stops
during the most severe weather. However, when there is a pinion nut
crop, Indians gather these nuts as long as there is no snow. This
crop is of uncertain appearance, and any given locality where there
are pinion trees do not bear more often than three or four years,
but when there is an abundance many tons are gathered by the Indians
at from 8 Â¢ to 160 per pound. No annuities have been paid members of
the tribe, but oil royalties have been expended in the leasing of
grazing lands. Seventy- five Navajo Indian scouts, who served in the
campaign against the Apache Indians in 1885-86 and in lates campaigns,
now receive pensions, or their widows, to the amount of$ 2,700.00 per
month, which has enabled them to live in comfort in declining days
of their lives.
