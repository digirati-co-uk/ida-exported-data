used for teaching and demonstrating farming at the school and
agency. More than fifty acres are devoted to alfalfa raising,
twenty acres to orchard, the remainder being planted to various
crops and rotated.
Intense cultivation is practiced, and the
farm is made to produce each year more than the year preceding.
A part of this farm is devoted to experimental work on
which various new kinds of grains, vegetables, and fruits are
tried out with a view of finding something that is better
adapted to the soil and climatic conditions of this reservation
than the products now raised.
For instance, seeds of corn and
beans have been collected from nearly every Indian reservation
in the United States and they are now growing on the experimen

Twenty odd varities of alfalfa and a number of clover
are being tried out, also sand vetches, millets, cowpeas, soy
beans, shallu and other forage plants.

of the United States as well as from foreign countries.
