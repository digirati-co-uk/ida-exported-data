CUNNARRATIVE.Section II- Ho alth.( Font' a).They will not entrust themselves or those they love to a stranger.Personal knowledge of the physician goes as far with them- andfarther- that it does with whitos.( a) The work here cannotpossibly be done wbthout addisional employes. There are one physician and one nurse here and there is allowed a position of FieldMatron at$ 300. per annum. This latter position I have never beenable to fiii. The salary is too small to induce anyone to undertakothe difficult duties of the position properly performed.6. No Field Matron.7.No employe provided to reach the Indian women at all.8. No field matrons to reach the families at all.9. If provided a field matron could be quartered at the CastleButto Station. There are 5 rooms in the house and the farmer and hiswife have no family. This is the only possible place a field matroncould be placed until more quarters are built on the reservationfor such purposes.REMARKS.The Indians live in Hogans or in the open air without eventhe protection of a hogan.. The hogan is about as near no houseas could be built, and thisis a blessing, for the Na va jo will not befit to live in a house for many years to come. TENTS they constantlyask for, and no better habit could possibly be cultivated among themthan the tent ha blt. They would then always be provided with adequateshelter that they could take with them in following the range feed,which they must do with their flocks. The lack of water too compelsthem to move sometimes many miles, and the hogan is a permanentstructure. They are frequently caught in severe storms without anyprotection at all with serious and often fatal results.
