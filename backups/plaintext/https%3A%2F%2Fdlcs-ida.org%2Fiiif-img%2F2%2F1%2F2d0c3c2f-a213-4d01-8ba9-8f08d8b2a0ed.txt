Copy.University of Arizona,Agricultural Experiment statim,TuoBon, Arizona. Aug. 13, 1910.Mr. Joseph Maxwell,Superintendentleupp Indian School,LeUPP, Arizona,Dear Sir:Flying to your letter of July sotn, please rindstater ent or analysis of the two Barples of water recently forwardedre by you.No. 4289 from the domestic well, contains a high percentageof soluhle galte for irrigating purposes, although this water maybe available for domestio use, in as much as many well in the SaltRiver Valley containing even larger quantities of soluble salta arein common use.No. 4290 from the irrigation well contains a less arount ofsoluble salte, which however, unfortunately includes about six parteof black alka11 which is very undesirable in an irrigi tion water.But in conjunction with rivor water, I should Judge thatthis supply could be used for a number of years without seriousdetriment to the land especially if the soil is well drained.I also enclose statement of analysis of sample of soilNo. 4291 which contains. 362 percent of soluble salts, and. 068percent of sodium carbonate or black alkali.
