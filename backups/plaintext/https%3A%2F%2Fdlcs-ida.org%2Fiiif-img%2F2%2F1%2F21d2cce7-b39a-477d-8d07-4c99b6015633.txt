Section VIII- Contracts.
Population.
Annual Report, 1913.
Once a year a business council of all the most intell
igent members of the tribe of both sexes is called, This
council is held in the month of June after planting season is
over. Many topics are discussed which are of great benefit
to the tribe. Among the topics are plural marriage, child
marriages, selling of young girls, home building, caring
for and improving the quality of the ir herds, etc. I find
that these yearly councils are of great help to me in the
discharge of my official duties and of much greater benefit
to the Indiens in general. The council this year was
held at Ganado, Arizona.
The head men have taken up the matter of suppressing
the evils of plural and child marriages. They are now
compwlling these people to be married legally. I would
advise that these councils be continued.
The Indiens under my jurisdiction do not receive
annuities and it is much better for them that they do not.
