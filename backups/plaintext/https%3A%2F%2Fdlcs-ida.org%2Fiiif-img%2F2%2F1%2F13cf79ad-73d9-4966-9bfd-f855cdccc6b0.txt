Seniors 2009
Through the ups and downs of our high school life we are still here, beating every obstacle laid in our paths, and ready
than ever to tackle whatever lies before us. Through the good and the bad, we remained strong and still, not quitting or
giving up. We perservered to the end and now we are proud to say..." We are the Graduating Class of 2009!" What the
future holds in store for us is a mystery, but whatever it is, we are more prepared than ever to face what comes our way.
