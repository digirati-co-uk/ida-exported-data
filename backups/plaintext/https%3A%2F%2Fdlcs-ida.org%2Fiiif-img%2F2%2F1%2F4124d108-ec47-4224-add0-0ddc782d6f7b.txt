VI. Comments.
No great departuros from the present industrial, health, and educational
programs are antiei patod. The general situation is fairly good considering
the money and facilities available. Realiai ng the impossibility of obtain
ing additional funds for new buildings nothing of that kind has been plan
ned. The industrial program will receive great benefit from the anticipa
ted sheep issue, and will encourage the Indians, as well as providing them
with nodded animals. We hope for sufficient road money to pormit the oxton
sion of the road system, to enable us to reach more sections of the reserva
tion for all administrative purposes, and to provide a means of income for
local Indians.
