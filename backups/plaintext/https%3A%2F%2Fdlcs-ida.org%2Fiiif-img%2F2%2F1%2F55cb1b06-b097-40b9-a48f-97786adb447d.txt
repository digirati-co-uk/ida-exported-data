No business
ohunoils
or committes
amoung
this tribe have been
established
, though
we have representative
men in various
sections
to assist
in the management
of affairs
as far as possible
and in this
way they are made to feel that they have some responsibility
in
affairs
and the men who have been chosen
to these positions
are
supposed
to exert their influence
in their locallity
in ways that
are beneficial
, or the carrying
out of any policy
that effects
the community
.
The Indians
on the Public
Domain
who have personal
property
have been 888888ed
and some have already
paid their taxes.
This assessment
, however
, doesnot
apply to any lands that have been
alloted
the Nava jos as they have no trust funds nor do they receive
any annuity
; they are self- supporting
.
