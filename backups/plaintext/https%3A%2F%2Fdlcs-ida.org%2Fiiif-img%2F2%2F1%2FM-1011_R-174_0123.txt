This comittee is cornposed ofa Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and seven" Teneantees" or district representatives from the Beveral districts of the reservationThese men are not elected by the people but are appointed by the spiritual men of the tribe.As a rule they are fairlyintelligent and reliable, but unfortunately, this year, they arenot even representatives of their people in this regard. TheirServices are of no value to ne or the tribe.. They are reactionaries of the worst sort; a hbnderance to the progress of thetribe and my official duties, instead of a halp. If people ofthis callibre continue in the se positions, I do not consider itadvisable to allow a continuation of same. If this body wereelected by the people for a term of one year, they could be ofsome value in taking the place of Indian Courts, etc., and inassisting in the carrying out of the policy of the Superintendent,The Indians of this reservation are self supportingthey are citizen Indians. They have no tribal trust funds, andreceive no annuities
