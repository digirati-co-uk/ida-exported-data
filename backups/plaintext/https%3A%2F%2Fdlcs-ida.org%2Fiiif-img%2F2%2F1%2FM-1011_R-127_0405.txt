them When the Navajos car Pind market for s one of their
three, four 2nd five year old steers it will time enough
to buy new bulls. So fer as I know they have not old
beef inel, except such as is bought by the local schools
and an occasional quarter by the Traders since the price
broke just after the Wold War. During the past few months
we have received a few inquiries concerning young steers
and have always made response to the effect that OU teers
my be purchased here either singly or in car load lots
but so far the inquiring parties have not put in

he year decidedly more successful on the San
Juan School farm than any of the recent preceding years
Two open ditches Jere constructed and as a result a con
siderable acreage that has not be en us ed for years pro
duced fair crops and give promise thi year. Last fall
the silo as filled with ensilage than which there could be
none better. The stalks tore heavy, fully leaved nd
Lveraged at least one fully developed ear to the stalk Und
in. ddition to this there was produced an equal amount
that husked and th stalks used as stover Enough
car corn wEs made to carry the hogs through the eas on
wo silos of the capacit of he present silo could easily
have been Tilled, had two such silos been available na
any occasion for filling, and all of this was produced
on land that had Ior years been water- logged and idle
a change that was the resuly of one of these ditches
This year a portion of the same tract is planted to po
tatoes about one half of which cane up, making about
half a stand. Those that germinated promise a good crop
The remainder of this land is again plented to corn and
I believe will yield enough to fill the silo he second
drain ditch constructed last year is operatin with
equal success. However it was completed too late in the
season to have much effect on last year crop. It is
my opinion that both of these ditch should be extended
The experiment to date is satisfactory it is believe a.
thet the seepin of the school farm, that has been getting
Worse and orse for the past 10 or 12 years has not only
been checked, but that the areas heretofore seeped will
ultimately be all reclaimed altho to bring about the
desired condition, the ditches will have to be extended
somewhat
