Dear Sir:
In reply to your lottor of the 5th instant in regard to Bischore',
bill for beof, and your statement that you understand and have been ad
vised that you are not bound to pay for beef deliver.d before the
Indian Appropriation Bill was passed, and before the contract was roc
alved by m8.
In this connection I can only say that I wired the
Department on June 30th for authority to purchase beet in the open
market, until the contractor comenced delivering. Reply cane by wire
the following day that you had been furnished your contract approved
on June 14th, and that I must look to you for beef.
Not hearing from
you juiy Ist or for several days thereafter- altho' I heard that you
had been in Santa Fe in the meantime I was forced to engage beet and
the lowest bid that I was able to obtain was from Bischoff at 9 cents.
Under the law controlling this matter, I can only submit the
vouchers for beef delivered by your agent( Mr. Reinken) and the amount
received from Bischoff- to the Department for settlement, and this will
cause great delay in the payment as it takes much time to arrange and
settle such irregular vouchers as these,
