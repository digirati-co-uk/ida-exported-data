253Santa Fe, New Mexico,Aigust 9,1898Mr. James M. Slavens,IKansas City, MODear Sir:In reply to your lottor of the 5th instant in regard to Bischore',bill for beof, and your statement that you understand and have been advised that you are not bound to pay for beef deliver.d before theIndian Appropriation Bill was passed, and before the contract was rocalved by m8.In this connection I can only say that I wired theDepartment on June 30th for authority to purchase beet in the openmarket, until the contractor comenced delivering. Reply cane by wirethe following day that you had been furnished your contract approvedon June 14th, and that I must look to you for beef.Not hearing fromyou juiy Ist or for several days thereafter- altho' I heard that youhad been in Santa Fe in the meantime I was forced to engage beet andthe lowest bid that I was able to obtain was from Bischoff at 9 cents.Under the law controlling this matter, I can only submit thevouchers for beef delivered by your agent( Mr. Reinken) and the amountreceived from Bischoff- to the Department for settlement, and this willcause great delay in the payment as it takes much time to arrange andsettle such irregular vouchers as these,
