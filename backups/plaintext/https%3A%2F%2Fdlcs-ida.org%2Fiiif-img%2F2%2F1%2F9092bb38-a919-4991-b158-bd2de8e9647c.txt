Arthur Luce Klein, president of Spoken Arts,
Inc., is on a tour of schools and colleges both in
America and abroad to present his one man
show of lectures, informal storytelling, and
dramatic monologues.
Dr. Klein has recently performed his' Art of
Storytelling' programs in London, Paris, and
Switzerland, where elementary schools, high
schools, and college audiences responded
enthusiastically.
Klein also performs skits he has written
himself. He presents an account of how
storytelling began, then offers his own version of
fairy tales in a style designed to educate and
liberate the emotions of people.
Mr. Klein performed Anton Chekov' s' On the
Harmfulness of Tobacco' for the Senior High and
' Art of Storytelling' for the Junior High.
