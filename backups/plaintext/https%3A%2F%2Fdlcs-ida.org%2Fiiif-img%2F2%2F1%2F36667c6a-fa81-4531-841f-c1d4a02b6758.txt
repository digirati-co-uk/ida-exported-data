SUPERINTENDENT.

Mrs. Emma Devore; Iowa; age 35; female; salary$ 720.00
per year; she has charge of the Little Water school taking
all her time; character; education; personal habits; qual
ifications all good. To Mrs. Devore belongs the sole credit
of bringing this school to its present flourishing condit
.
ion and getting the pupils, she has been an untireing zeal
ous worker; there are very few women who would have gone to
Little Water at the time she did and face the difficulties
she was obliged to, and start a school in an Indian country
35 miles from a white neighbor, knowing there was not a per
son for miles arround that could speak a word of English,
and there would be none except an occasional visitor until
she had taught her pupils to talk English, and the only com
pany she could hope to have would be blanket Indians, she has
by her kindness, and good example induced them to allow their
children to attend her school; that she has been eminently
successful cannot be disputed. In view of the fact, I
would recommend that Mrs. Devore be appointed superintendent
of this school, and that she be sent a corps of good able
assistants, people who are known not to be faultfinding, and
have no desire to quarrel.
