The Board, after a great deal of thought and someyears of controversy as to the interpretation of that wereof the opinion that the Congress inpassing the law with thephrases as stated, must have had, or did have some verydefinite idea as to the differences betweenimprovementsplaced thereon and made therein, and we determined that thephrase' improvements made therein"were improvementsmade upon the land to change it from its raw. state to a statefit for cultivation and irrigation, which meant, in accordancewith our decision, improvements of reducing the land to acultivable and irrigible state such as plowing, leveling,15 disking, ditching, eit, making it the best available forcultivation unde irrigation, if it was irrigated. Thatin a general way, is what I wouldsay we determined as themeaning and application of that phrase.
