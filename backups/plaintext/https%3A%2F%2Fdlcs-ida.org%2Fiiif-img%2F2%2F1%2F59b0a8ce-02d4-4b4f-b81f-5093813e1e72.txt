Clark,Attorney for Mr. Nebeker, after I had reached Flagstaff from TubaCity. I do not attach any importanceto said eight affidavitsfrom the fact that the Piutes purportingto have made the saidaffidavitsall reside in the vicinity of Tuba City, a number ofthem being present at my investigation, and could have been calledupon by the Mormons to testify before me had they regardedtheirtostimonyimportant, but no referencewas then made to any of themas being witnessesin the matter, except that Leheigh, whose name isgiven in Exhibit 21 as" lohi, Chief of Piute Indians" was calledas a witness by Mr. Nebeker and testifiedbefore me at MoencopioJuly 28th;( soe Exhibit 9), which tostimonyis not so favorableto theMormons as expressedin Lohi's purported affidavitacknowledgedJune29th. 1898, and which togetherwith the fact that the wording issimilarin all of said eight affidavitsI regard them as not entitledto any consideration.There are a number of Piuto Indianslivingin the vicinityor Tuba City, many of whom I saw; they live onfriendlyterms with Navajo's, Moqui's and Whites and impressedme aslackingforce of characterand ready to please either party whichevorthey chancedto be with when none ot the other party were present.
