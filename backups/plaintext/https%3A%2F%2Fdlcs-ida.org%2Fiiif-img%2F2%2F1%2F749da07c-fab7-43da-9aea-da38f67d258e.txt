SECTION VII. ADMINISTRATION AND REORGANIZATION:
A. Office
the office has boen almost completely roorganized and at the present time
we have an officient office organization in which I havo roat confidonce.
111 of us are now in the Service and mistakes aro frequently made, but am
ploased to Ã¦tate that the same mistake is very soldan mado twice, and with a
19ttle more experience think we will have an organization that will be hard
to bogt.
B. Outsido Dopartments,
Several othor Changes should be made in different branches of the organiza
tion to work out a more harmonious machine. Teveral muggestions in connection
with the annual officiency reports and justifications giron thorofor, as of
April 1, 1931, have boon made, and I respocttully invite your attention to
those recommendations, Changos requested and recommended were made with the
idea in mind of a maldng a moro orfioiont organization and without additional
expense, Some positions should be abolished and other now positions croatod.
