313INDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL,Santa Fe, New Mexico, June 17, 1892.Supervisor David S.Keck,Albuquerque, N.M.Dear Sir:Replying to your letter of the 11th, inst.recommending that Mrs.Spradling be retained as an employe in this school, I em surprised thatyou make such request. She has not proven herself to be a capable andfaithful employe; she is and has been for the past year an element of difcord anging the employes of the school; she is not loyal to the best interests of the school;she has criticised its managenent at home andabroad.I admit that she is poor and has children to support, but she xshould, in my opinion, appreciate in a certain measure, what her friendshave done for her and work for the best interests of the school.She is a good nurse, or rather can be, and no doubt would do good workin such a position in another school away from her friends who have espoused her cause, regardless of her conduct towards the school or thecharacter of the work she has done.When you were here last fall, you advised me to create harmony amongthe employes.I sought to do so and made some changes in the force ofemployes with that end in view. I hoped that Mrs.Spradling would attento become xXE Rax more friendly toward other employes; but such hasnot been the case.I am willing to use my influence to secure her* pomsition elsewhere, as far as I can do so conscientiously.Very respectfullybat dupa
