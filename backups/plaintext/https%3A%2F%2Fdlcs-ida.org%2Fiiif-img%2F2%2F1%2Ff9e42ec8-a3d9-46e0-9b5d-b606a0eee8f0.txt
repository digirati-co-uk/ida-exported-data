A list of my recommendations
will be found as follows
:
That the Indians of Laguna Pueblo's
have the lands they have occu
pied for so many years set apart for them as a reservation
. Page 3.
That the horse, farm wagons, and carriage
at the Santa Fe
agency be transferred
to the Santa Fe Indian Industrial
School.
