Bush, Additional Farmer, who is an expert, in aletter dated July 29th 1912,( herewith) relative to thecondition of the school farm says:" Five acres of the east end has been planted to Melons andvegetables and the north half of the remaining 15 acres tooate, while the South half was Bowed with black hulled whiteKaffir- corn.* The melons and vegetables failed to come up, with theexception of a scattering plant here and there; and the oatsand kaffir corn is a very poor stand, being uneven and light,and with an unhealthy color in general.The soil shows the effect of solide contained in theirrigating water to a much greater extent than it did lastyear, which proves conclusively that it cannot be made toproduce a profitable crop. It is approximately twenty feetto the ground- water underlying the farm, and this watercontains the same elements as that used in irrigating. Theground is heavily charged with alkall also and the capillaryaction which takes place as the ground water rises to thesurface, together with the effect of evaportation, is leavinga heavy crust of solids on the surface making it impossible toraise crops profitably. It is evident that it is impossibleto obtain satisfactory results, as each succeeding yearshows a greater amount of alkali solids and crusted surfacethan the past."
