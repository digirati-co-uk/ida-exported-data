Mrs. Effie Lucero, cook and housekeeper at the hospital.
Mrs. Lucero is a very efficient woman. She spent twelve years
in Carlisle. She is a full- blood Indian, and a native of
Laguna, although her present home is San Felipe she being
married to Pedro Lucero of that pueblo. Beside having a good
knowledge of domestic science she understands Indian cookery
and can prepare true Indian food for those that desire it.
This makes the stay of the older Indians in the hospital far
more agreeable to them.
