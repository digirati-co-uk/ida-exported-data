among them progresses.As stated above, there are many needs in the wayof additional buildings at this school, but a recommendationfor an extensive building program cannot be made at this timeon account of the present condition of the Little ColoradoRiver. This plant is very well equipped at the presenttime.. I believe with very few exceptions, the present corpsof employees at this school are as efficient and loyalas can be found. They work well together and have theinterest of the pupils and Indians at heart and he artilyco- operate in anything that is for the betterment orimprovement of the school and reservation.It is difficult to compare the accomplishments ofone year with those of another, because of the pe cullarenvironments and living conditions of the Indians. Thegreat ne ed of the Indians is additional water for theirstock and the development of water is necessarily slow.The development of one project me ans a great deal to theIndians living in that particular locality.In my opinion, it will be necessary to continue agovernment school under this jurisdiction for many years.It is only through knowledge of the methods and means ofdoing and a thorough understanding of the living standardsof the White Man that the Indians can hope to compete withhim. The Indians of this reservation are far removedfrom any possibility of attaining an education throughtheir own resources and the State or County is not in aposition to assume the responsibility of educating theIndian, and it must necessarily be handled in the presentmanner for many years to come.####- 2-
