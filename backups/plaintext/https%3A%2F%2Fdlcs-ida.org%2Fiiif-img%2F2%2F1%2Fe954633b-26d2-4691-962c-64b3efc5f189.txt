among them progresses.
As stated above, there are many needs in the way
of additional buildings at this school, but a recommendation
for an extensive building program cannot be made at this time
on account of the present condition of the Little Colorado
River. This plant is very well equipped at the present
time.
. I believe with very few exceptions, the present corps
of employees at this school are as efficient and loyal
as can be found. They work well together and have the
interest of the pupils and Indians at heart and he artily
co- operate in anything that is for the betterment or
improvement of the school and reservation.
It is difficult to compare the accomplishments of
one year with those of another, because of the pe cullar
environments and living conditions of the Indians. The
great ne ed of the Indians is additional water for their
stock and the development of water is necessarily slow.
The development of one project me ans a great deal to the
Indians living in that particular locality.
In my opinion, it will be necessary to continue a
government school under this jurisdiction for many years.
It is only through knowledge of the methods and means of
doing and a thorough understanding of the living standards
of the White Man that the Indians can hope to compete with
him. The Indians of this reservation are far removed
from any possibility of attaining an education through
their own resources and the State or County is not in a
position to assume the responsibility of educating the
Indian, and it must necessarily be handled in the present
manner for many years to come.
