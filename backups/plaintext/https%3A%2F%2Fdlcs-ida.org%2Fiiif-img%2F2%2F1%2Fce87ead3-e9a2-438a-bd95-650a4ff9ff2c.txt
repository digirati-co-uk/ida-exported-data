ing implement, or claimed it for any purpose whatever.It wasas freefrom any claim as any part of the unsettled public domain could possiblybeI have lived close to this place ever since the first year it wasfarmed, and it has always been one othe most productive farms in thesettlement, and large crops have been raised on it every year.In 1878it was set off by the community or company to John W. Young, who held itand farmed it for about ten years, when he sold it to Lot Smith.Heheld it and Armed it every year until he was killed on the place by aNavajo Indian in June, 1892.Soon after this it was sold to Ashton Nebeker by Mrs. Alice Smith, widow of Lot Smith, who was living on theplace at the time of his death, and rema ned in possession until it wastransferred to Nebeker.At the time Nebeker took it the farm was allfenced, with good substantial wire fencing; I do not know just how manyacres were cultivated that year, but it wasa la rge crop.Therewasthen a stone dwelling house, a stone factory that had been built in 1877,a log cabin and two ce llars on the place, an orchard of about 200 fruittrees all in bearing.During all this time no Indi au whatever made any cla in whateverto any any partof this land; none of them had ever been upon it exceptto work for wages or to cultivate some of the land on shares, which hasbeen done s eve ra.l time in that settlement, and to my positive knowledgeno Indian on earth had any right to his place in any way, shape or manner.The place has never been unoccupied since the first.SinceNebeker has owned it, he has fa rmed it constantly, lived there exclusively, and by his hard work had added largely to the improvements. Besideswhat I have mentodned, he has a nursery of several thousand fruit treeson the place. He is a good neighbor, and a peaceable, law- abiding,honest man-- one of the best citizens I have ever known.He has suffereda great deal of imposition and annoyance at the ha nds of the Indians,and very few men would have conducted himself as patiently as he hasunder the circumstances. I will say, however, that he had no troublewhatever until after the allotments were made.The allotting a gent, Mahugh, took no testimony whatever fromthe white settlers at Tuba City, and did not even notify us what he wasthere for.There are only si xteen families living at Tuba City, and
