DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIORINDIAN FIELD SERVICEEastern Navajo Agency,Crown Point, New MexicoJuly 3, 1930Commissioner of Indian AffairsWashington, D. C.JUL81930 FEGEIVEOLASFFAIRSSir:There is enolosed, herewith, annual report for 1930 induplicate, This report has been given very close consideration and the figures inserted I believe to be asnear correct as it is possible to obtain.The preparation of census for 1930 has been a very slowprocedure. The Federal consus overlapped in many 10calities, thus causing a condition that had to be rechecked in order to have correct figures. This hastaken an immense amount of time and explains why it hasbeen impossible to submit the census at an earlier date.At the time the sensus was taken a great number of ourIndians had moved to other localities, if not to otherstates, it being a hard matter to obtain a correct record of them.The matter of births and deaths has been our greatestconcern as parents will not report births, nor will Indiansreport deaths until weeks and even months subsequentthereto. This has caused further necessity for recheok.Very truly yours,S. I StacherS. F. Stacher,Superintendent.Recapegosheets I I3 not received7-8-303267- B/ R- 3also
