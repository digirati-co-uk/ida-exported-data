Santa FeAnnual ReportIndustries- 2This is due to some extent, no doubt, to the fact that theirhorses are small and one team could hardly pull a plow that wouldthrow an eight or ten inch furrow However, I believe that theiruse of a light plow is due more to the ir lack of know ledge as towhat the use of a heavy plow means in securing a greater yieldthrough breaking and loosening the ground to the necessary depth,for the lack of suitable horses could be obviated, in this res.pect, by using four or even six horses where necessary ona heavyplow.Corn, wheat, beans, alfalfa, with some chile, are the cropsraised. There are a few small orchards in most of the pueblos, anda very few of the Indians have small gardens, Little or no smallfruit is raised, with the exception of me lons, which are raised toalarge extent. Small fruit and more extensive gardens would bevery desirable for home consumption of the Indians, if no attemptwas made to market these products.. Orchards, particularly appleorchards, have been demonstrated by white and Mexican farmers tobe very profitable all through this district, and I am very anx.ious to issue apple trees to the individual Indians sufficient toprovide for their own use, and to set out on community lands orchards as a commercial proposition. The average annual returnfrom apple orchards in northern New Mexico is large, and puebloorchards would, through the sale of the fruit, provide an incometo be used in general improvements for the c onmon use and benefitof the communityMost of the Indians have a considerable number of horsesbut they are small, with no market value, and not adapted to theneeds of the Indians as work animals because of the ir size. Itis desired to improve this condition, and with this end in viewrecommendation will be submitted for the purchase of stallions ofthe lighter draft type to improve the size and breed of Indianhorses. Purcha se of jacks will also be requested for use in breeding to the larger animals, which will enable the Indians to securemules of a fair size for farming purposes before the gene ral sizeof the ir stock can be increased through the breeding up processReconumendation will be submitted for purchase of tractionthreshing outfits, one for use at Santa Clara, San Juan, SanIldefonso, Tesuque and Nambe, one for us e at Santo Domingo andCochit, one for use at Jemez and Zia, and a portable out it foruse at Taos
