In reply to office
Letter, Education
, dated April 20,1898
, I have the
honor to state that not only for the past year, but from the time the
sc100) was established
a Physician
has been furnished
that
by
Connct
and this moda' has proved not only satisfactory
out has given
the best service for the least cost,
The school is located nearly three miles from tow and the Physi
cian has to furnish his own conveyance
and team and besides visiting
the school three times each week he has been required most of the time
' core every day and often in the night,
After repeated inquiry and consultation the lowest price for
which such service can be obtained is$ 500.00 per year.
The school is well supplied with medicines and medical supplies
and such surgical appliances as the physician would be likely to noed
in his practice but no physician of reputable standing would agree to
furnish any of these for this pay, but it is deemed that this amount
is saall pay for such service, I therefore request that I be authorized
to continue
the employment
by contract
