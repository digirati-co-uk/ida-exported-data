Industries continued --19.A great saving in water could be made by use of concreteditches in place of the present earth ones, as more than fiftypercent of the water is lost by seepage, since the compositionof the soil in their vicinity is sandy, and there water isconducted for a distance of 15 miles or more, it is readily seenthat the greater portion of it di sappear.The Indians haveassured me that they will give their labor free in constructingconcrete di tches, provided the Department will supply the cement,have the survey made, and appoint someone to supervise the work.There is a well- drilling outfit operated by the IrrigationDepartment maintained in this district, but little good hasresulted therefrom as the drilling has not been done where theIndians need the wells as sources of supply for stock raising,but the effort has been confined to drilling wells along theriver, where the supply already exists.There are no licensed traders in this jurisdiction.Many of the Indians conduct stores, and as these were in operationbefore the country was made" Indian Country, no effort has beenmade to compel these Indians to take out licenses.The Pueblo Indians working outside the reservation giveexcellent satisfaction. Many of them are employed by the SantaOthersFe Railway, both in its shops and a long its right- of- way.
