Department of theInterior,INDIAN SCHOOL SERVICE,OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT,Albuquerque Indian Trainins School, N. MD,March 16th, 1897,To The HonorableThe Secretary of the Interior,Sir:-I have the honor to report that I have this day completed myinspection or this school, and I find in actual attendance 310pupils-- 184 boys and 126 girls. They are from the dirferenttribes scattered throughout New Mexico and Arizona, and, whilethey are called Indians, they are nearly all in fact a mixture ofMexican, Indian, Spanish and American, and I do not suppose thereare exceeding 14 of the entire number Indians,These childrenI find have been well taught, fed,clothed and cared for and havemade the usual progress as made by children in Indian schoolssince my last inspection.-- which was made when the school wasunder the charge of Jno, J. McKoin.I do not see that the schoolis really any better now than then--- axe ept perhaps in industrialdepartments, that is to say, the farming is in somewhat bettershape; but this merely rolates to the preparation, as nothing isnow growing.
