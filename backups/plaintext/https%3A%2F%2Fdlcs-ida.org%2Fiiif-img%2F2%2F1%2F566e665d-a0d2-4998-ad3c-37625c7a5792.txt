Field Irrigation,
Annual Report, 1911.
Puoblo Day Schools at Santa Fo, N.M.
All of the Pueblos dopend upon irrigation for their
orops, and ditohes are taken out of the most conveniont water
courses and such ditches were constructed and in use by them
long before the whito man's advent in this section,
Tho
Indians' title to water is not yet perfected, but preliminary
s tops have been taken to have their rights adjudicated by the
Courts of New Mexico in all the Pueblos and it is expected
that their rights will be finally settled in all cases at as
early a date as they can be presented and reached by the
Courts.
The Superintendent of Irrigation at Albuquer que has
filed papers with the Territorial Engineer of New Mexico in
regard to the water rights of all the Pueblos and has promised
to have a survey made of the Rio Teguque Valley so that the
Attorney for the Pueblo Indians can go into Court and have the
water rights of the Tesu que Indians adjudicated, and it is
proposed to take the same course with the other Pueblos at
as early a date as possible.
