SouthernPueblosAgency,Albuquerque, New Mexico.SECTION IV" INDUSTRIES"The Indians of this jurisdiction can be divided into twodistinot clases- those of the Rio Grande valley pueblos of Isleta,Sandia, Santa Ana, San Felipe, Jemez, and Sia, who are primarilyagriculturists, and those of the pueblos of Laguna and Acoma, who areprimarily stock raisers.The Indians of Laguna and Acoma are utilizing all of theiravailable lands and in some instances are leasing outside land for thepurpose of sheep raising. They are also cultivating all of the landin the San Jose river valley and their problem at the present time isthat of more grazing land and the improvement of their sheep and cattle.The Indians of the Rio Grande valley are utilizing practicallyall of their agricultural lands with the exception of the pueblo ofSandia, who actually have a surplus, but none of them are utilizingtheir range lands to full advantage. It is our program to induce theseIndians to raise sheep and cattle so that they may utilize all of theirrange land themselves and discontinue leasing same to outsiders. Tothis end we have issued 800 head of sheep on the reimbursable plan to17 individual Indians of the San Felipe pueblo, and will continue thispolicy with all of the Indians of the Rio Grande valley with the viewto complete utilization of their rang es by the Indians themselves.The Indians of this jurisdiction are very industrious and aregradually employing better farming methods, but this is very slow dueto the fact that the chief duties of the farmers of this jurisdictionare law and order work, which by the nature of this work itself makesit come first before any agricultural instruction program. It is practically impossible for a farmer to gain the respect and confidence of theIndians to the extent of persuading them to adopt newer farming methodswhen he has to aot as law officer in the pueblo. The nature of agricultural instruction and law and order work are diametrically opposedand no advancement can be made in the former until it is entirely separated from the latter. Until these two propositions are separated inthe work of the farmers, all talk of a definite agricultural programto be carried out by them is purely theoretical as the first requisiteto the success of any program is the confidence of the Indians in theemployees that are to put it over and this confidence cannot be gainedby these same employees doing police work among the Indians.With the completion of the proposed Rio Grande ConservancyDistrict there seems to be wonderful opportunity for the Indians inthe Rio Grande valley to take up dairying and produoe farming.
