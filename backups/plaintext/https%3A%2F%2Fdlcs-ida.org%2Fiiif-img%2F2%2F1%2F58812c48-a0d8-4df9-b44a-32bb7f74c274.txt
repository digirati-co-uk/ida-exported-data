San Juan( Continued) pp. 2.
The Indians of this pueblo have taken kindly to edu
cational opportunities and they have always been friendly
and tractable. While there may not be any extreme need
among them there can never be any surplus of production
save through intensive lines of poultry, dairy, and swine
herd. Chickens and turkeys do well in their equitable
climate. Dairy coves and milk goats would make best contri
bution to family support, and with better care they could
produce milk in excess of pueblo needs and there is always
2 merket for clean product from the dairy or poultry yara.
