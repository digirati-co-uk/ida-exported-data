Dear Sir:
Replying to yours of the 27th in which you state that the Council
requests further time in which to make the promised extention to the
school- house, pornit me to state that any bargain or arrangement that
you may make with the Governor and the Counail will be satisfactory to
me. I realize that it is getting too late to make adobes even in Santa
Ie, and it must be colder with you.
Respectfully,
Branded
Suporintondent.
