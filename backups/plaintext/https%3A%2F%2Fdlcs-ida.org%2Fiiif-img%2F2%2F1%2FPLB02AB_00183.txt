LAW OFFICESHANNA WILSONDoS OFIRST NATIONAL BANK BUILDINGALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICORICHARD H. HANNAFRED. WILSONDUDLEY CORNELLFebruary 12, 1930.Mr. George A. H. Fraser,Special Asst. to Attorney General,Catron Bldg.,Santa Fe, N. M.Dear Mr. Fraser:Pablo Abeita has been in several timesdiscussing the possibilities of changing the result in thePa blo Chavez claim at Isleta lying at the northeast cornerof the grant next to the river. I am sure you remember thisclaim, as it was one of the very strongest claims from theIndian side that we had at Isle ta, yet because of testimonythat seems to have been perjured on the part of the claimantand the witnesses, the claim was allowed by.Judge Neblett tothe claimant. Today Pablo was in again with quite adelegation from Isleta, stating that they have decided theypositively want to do some thing about that claim.It seems that the river has shifted itscourse to the east at this place, and under the degree of thecourt the claimant will get a lot more land the n even wasoriginally claimed.It seems to us that the first step in theconsideration of any action in this claim would necessarilybe to have the stenographer transcribe the evidence on thisclaim. Please advise us whether you have a transcript ofthis evidence, and if not, Pablowants to have the stenographerWrite it up for further study of the matter.Best regards,DC: IB
