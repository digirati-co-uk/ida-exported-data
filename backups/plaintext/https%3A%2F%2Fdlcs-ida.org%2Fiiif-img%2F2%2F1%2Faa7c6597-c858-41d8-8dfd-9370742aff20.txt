Law& Order- 2-and agency departments has been satisfactory considering thedifficulties which this jurisdiction faced during the past year,Four employees were dismissed for cause and the attendant 111- feelingwhich resulted has reduced the morale of thos employees remaining toa rather low ebb. The out- look for the coming year, however, is verygood and the results will doubtless be much better during the next year.There is considerable evidence of 111icit transaction inthe liquor business, and, at the present time, there is no adequateme ans for providing a definite follow- up in maintaining a decent standardof law and order. It appears that 11quor enters the reservation fromat least three sources and that several of the Indians are directlyand indirectly engaged in its transportation and sale. A request hasbeen made to the office for designation of two 11quor officers whichit is hoped will. immediately help the situation materially.The moral standards of the Indians are as yet not developedto a point where the usual customs with relation to marriage anddivorce are being followed out. There are many, many plural wives,and there is no machinery whereby the matter is being regulated. Thecustom of purchase of a wife seems to be followed out in numerousinstances. There is no system of granting of marriage license andthere is no check on the births and deaths, consequently it is impossible to estimate accurately the population of the reservationor to keep any statistics with relation to births and deaths,marriages, etc.The Indians appear to be quite fond of the native dancesand have held several on the Reservation during the past year.The sedances have the old tribal customs with slight modifications.
