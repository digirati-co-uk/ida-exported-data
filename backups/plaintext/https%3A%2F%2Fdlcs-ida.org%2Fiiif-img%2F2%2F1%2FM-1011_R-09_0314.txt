COMMissioner of Indian Affaire,- 10In conclusion, I would state that I believe theCarlisle School is coming more and more every day to justifythe expense occasioned by keeping it in Oxietence. The moverecently made in thie school to place the industrial, as wellas the academic, instruction up on a strictly school basis,accompanied by that of organizing special secondary vocationalcourses for pupile of advanced years and attainments, is onethat is going to have far- reaching results, Likewise, theestablishment of a course in cooking and general home- makingthe past year ie another thing that is going to count, It isalmost inconceivable how a school of the magnitude and influence of the one could have gone on for so long withoutgiving a definite line of instruction of this s Ort,I believe every person connected with this instituti. or, from the Superintendent down to the lowest paid clerk,has the welfare of the Indian boys and girls at heart; andI believe that every one is making some serious at tempt toacquaint hima elf with the conditions under which the Indianlives and will have to live, and that, therefore, each oneis constituting himself a more or less active factor in theWork of adapting the instruction given in this sch Ool to meetthe most urgent needs of its pupils,Very respectfully submitted,i terJDD: SRActing Superintendent
