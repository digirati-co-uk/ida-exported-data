I authorised Mr. John P. Wieland" to
order
from you about 150 Dollars worth of Fruit trees forut his
School He proposed to get you to send the trees to him and send him
a power of attorney to sign receipts for the trees and ship them to
him But I have considered the matter over and have decided best
you to sign the receipts yourself and to do so is if the trees were
purchased from W. R, Stark. alone, This is to avoid cnsiderable red
tape in cases where purchases are made from a company when each
member of the farm is required to be signed to the triplicate vouchers
I therefore Send You triplicate vouchers to be signed by you
as in.
be care
dicated
in pencil merk in your name and in triplicate also
tal to sign two Bills made out
over your bill heads naming the things
in detail as mentioned by Mr. Wieldandy" Received Payment."
I enclose The Vouchers in Triplicate and my Check for 150 Dollars
to pay for the trees and a form for the Bills you have to make to
attach to the thres vouchers, please complete the vouchers as soon
as you can after receiving this letter as I must have the receipts so
as to expand the money in the present quarter Mailthem and send the
trees as soon after as practicable. Respetrully/ 1. M. Jongs
