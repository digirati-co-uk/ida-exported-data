- 3-The expenditures for this school have beenpractically the same for the past three or four years,there being the same number of pupils here to foreappropriated for. I have during the past three yearsespecially emphasized economy in all de per tments of theschool; hence, no real increase has been involved; butour surplus stock is now exhausted and the situation getsmore serious each yeer, making both ends meet and keepingthe school running efficiently.The playgrounds for the boys and girls are usedconstantly when the pupils are at liberty, and do a greatdeal of good to the pupils. The campus is well leid outwith trees, shrubs and flowers, and I do not hesitate tostate that our grounds, or campus is one of the prettiestin this section of the country. We have a greenhousein which we place the flowers during the cold weather.If it were not for the Indian School here thereare over 2000 Indian children who would never see the inside of a school house. The state authorities, in mostcases do not enforce school attendance upon Indians. Alsothe families roam about considerably and do not stay inany place long enough to allow their children to attendschool. Most of the families prefer to have their childrenattend the Government school so that the children canpursue their studies and the parents can continue to maketheir living among lumber camps, fishing or berry- picking,etc., without dragging their children along with them.Of course, the school is small for the number eligible toattend it, and many prospective pupils have to be refusedadmission; but many receive much benefit. Considering theattitude of the state and County authorities towardattendance of Indians and considering the number of eligibleIndian children in Michigan I am of the opinion that theSchool should continue in operation for a number of yearsyet, possibly, fifteen or twenty years at least. To abolishthis school would be a calamity to the Indians of Michigan.Me ny would grow up without any schooling whatever underpre sent existing conditions.
