Lovato, Chairman ofthe All Indian Pueblo Council, Inc. for 8 years, resigned fromhis position as Chairman. Forewith is his outgoing message tothe students and staff of Santa Fe Indian School. He will begreatly missed but long rememberedas one of the leaders whosuccessfully assisted the 19 Pueblo Tribes in many facets ofdeep concern to the Indian people of New Mexico:Education continues to be a number one priority for many of our Pueblo Tribes. The All IndianPueblo Council, approximately seven years ago became a comprehensive program to identify andreprogram the educational priorities of Pueblo Tribes. One such priority was the contracting ofwhat was the Albuquerque Indian School and is now a junior/ senior high school, the Santa FeIndian School.While education has continued to provide the human resources necessary for the variouseconomic ventures which have now begun on reservations, and which will be mandatory in orderto survive in the future due to lack of funding, it is important that we develop and promoteeducational programs especially those stressing work experience to broaden and improve skills ofour people.What the Santa Fe Indian School has attempted to establish is not education for its own sake,but education for the sake of those who tomorrow must inevitably lead others. It has always beensaid that our Indian youth of today are our tomorrow' s leaders. As such, education continues tobe the number one priority of the Pueblo Tribes today. It is imperative that as young Indianpeople you must strive to educate yourselves in order to achieve the ultimate for yourselves andyour people. You must learn to compete with all people in order to be successful, but in doing so,never forget that which makes us unique as Indian people- our traditional and religiousupbringing.Delfin J. Lovato, Chairman
