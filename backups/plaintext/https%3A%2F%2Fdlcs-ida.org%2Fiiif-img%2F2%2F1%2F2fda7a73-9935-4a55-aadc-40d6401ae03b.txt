And Robert, I hope you keep your head in those books.We made it guys!! But does time fly. I hope the days come easy and the moments pass slowly,and each road leads you where you want to go. I hope you always forgive, you never regret,and help somebody every chance you get. Find god' s grace in every mistake and always giveback more then you take.
