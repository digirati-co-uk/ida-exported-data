M., December 10, 1891.Commissionerof Indian Arfairs,Washington, D, C.Sir:Replying to your letter of Nov. 24th last, I have the honorto report that I have carefully considered the question of employing an additional teacher.I think that our appropriation willjustify the employing of another Teacher the last half of thefiscal year, but there is one difficulty in the way which I amyet unable to meet.We have no place where we can put anotherTeacher at present.All of the school rooms not used for schoolare occupied as dormitories.When the building for employes'quarters is comploted, we can utilize a part of that for dormitories, and thus vasate the sohool rooms now occupied for that purposo,With favorable weather I think we may be able to have partof this new building ready for occupanoy by the latter part ofMarah.Very respectfully,HeartSuperintendent.
