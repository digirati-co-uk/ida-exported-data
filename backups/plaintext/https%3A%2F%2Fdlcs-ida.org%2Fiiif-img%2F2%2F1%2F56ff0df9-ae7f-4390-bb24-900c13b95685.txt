every possibl. #ffort it was found that not w
an interior
#Yoom could be installed
for that
amount. The necessity for an oloctric light plant
at this school has buon dumonstrated
to your 01
fice and the increased capacity of the school
makes the demand for at even greater now.
respectfully urge that • su nos less than$ 4500.00
be appropri ted for a thorough and complot. ol • c
tric lighting systeia and that this appropriation
be immediately available. In connection herewith
I wish to star. that if an appropriation
for a
Trades Building& equiptaunt of sazas as askedffor,
be made, that only$ 2000.00 be appropriat.d for
electric equipment
at the engines and ballers for
the trades building will turnish th: power for
the ulectric
lighting
system
Water
and Sewerage
A sun not less than$ 2000.00 should be ap
propriated
for this purpose. The yearly
expense
for surficient
water for irrigation
and domestic
purposes is$ 1500.00 and the balance($ 200,00)
is a most conservative
estimate
for keeping
the
same in repair and for improving
and extending
the sewerage
system as required,
