Santa Fe, 1.3., July 28, 1924.then in charge of the Company'soperationsin thisdistrict, stated that such an installationwasseriously considered. He then informed me that theCompany was of the opinion that a small plant couldbe erected at Farmingtonat a reasonablecost whichwould take care of the gasoline needs of the San JuanBasin. Since that time, however, I have conferredwith the officialsif the Companyin Denver and theynow advise me that a small refineryis quite out ofthe questionand state that a plant to properly treatthis oil would cost over$ 200,000,- a statementwiththe accuracy of which I am not at all impressed. Itis, of course, a matter about which the governmentcannot have anything particularto say, unless itresults in obtainingfrom the crude altogethertoosmall a royalty for the Indians.The present intentionof the Company, accordingto my last advices, is to ship not more than a thousandbarrels of the Hogback crude to the refineriesof theContinentalOil Company at Florence, Colorado, andSalt ia ke City, and they advise me that they cannottell what they can get for it, but stronglyintima tethat all they will be able to pay is 32.00, or less,a berrel, a figure which, in my opinion, is altogethertoo low, in view of the high gasoline contentof thiscrude. Accord ing to inforiaationwhich has been furnished me, there was used last year in Coloradocounties,within or contiguousto the San Juan Basin, 3,966, 750ga llons of gasoline; and in the New Mexico counties,within the same general area, 2,457,497gallons; thatis, in all, 6, 424,247 gallons. This estimate probablyincludesdistrictsratherremote from Farmington, butthe Midwest themselves, at the time they first talkedof putting in a refinery, ste ted to me that, puttingin a small refinery, there would undoubtedlybe amarket there for as much as 250 barrelsa day of gasoline.The people of the Besin have all along, and still arelooking forwardto obtainingreasonablycheap gasolinefrom the shiprock field, and will be grievouslydisappointed if they are not able to do so. They are nowpaying eight or ten cents a gallon more for gasolinethan the average price in New Mexico.
