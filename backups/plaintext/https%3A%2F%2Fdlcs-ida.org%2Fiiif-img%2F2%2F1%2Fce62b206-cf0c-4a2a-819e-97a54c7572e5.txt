San Juan School& Agency
Ex- pupils are required to obtain marriage licenses through
the local state suthorities and be married in conformity with
state law and there have been thus far no divorces among those
Indians who have been legally married.
The Presbyterian Church maintains a mission some five
miles from this agency and another at Tee conospas about thirty
miles northeast of Shiprock.
A medical mission is supported by the Presbyterians at
Teeceno spag. This medical station is doing excellent work,
particularly in the treatment of trachoma and tuberculosis
among the Indians in the vicinity of Teeceno spas and Red Rock.
The success of this work is due to the physician in charge,
Dr. R. W. Beli. Steps have been taken lolking to the building
of a hospital at Red Rock by Dr. Bell and his associates.
The Dutch Reform Church has a mission at Toadlona.
Due to the vigorous measures taken for the suppression
of the liquor traffic since the establishment of this agency,
very little liquor finds its way to this reservation.
The territory surrounding the San Juan Reservation is
dry under state prohibition and local option. Little 11 any
liquor is obtained by the Indians who visit points adjacent
to the reservation. There are no saloons on this reserva
tion.
