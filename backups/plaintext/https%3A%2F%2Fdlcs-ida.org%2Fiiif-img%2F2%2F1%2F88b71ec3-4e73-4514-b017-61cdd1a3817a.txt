MISCELLANEOUS.
The change of Agents occuring September 30th 1898, ne
cessitated a transfer of property and an examination was made so
far as possible of the property in cash reports made at that time
and subsequently turned over to the new Agent.
I have had occa-
sion in tae previous report to call attention to some very cur
ious matters connected with these reports, to which I have given
considerable attention.
The method of making reports is so me
what farcical- they are generally made from paper records or
memorandums and submitted to the Department in that form, andir
found correct on paper are
11
approved".
I do not ascribe to
the Account Department of the Indian Bureau a single dereliction
in this matter.
The irregularities referred to canonly be
learned by an inspection in the field and could be carried on for
years without being detected by the Bureau,
The irregularities
I refer to arise from the fact that an inventory is not taken as
required by the regulations.
The Agent when assuming his duties
becomes responsible for a certain amount of property- other proper
underadrianus for future
ty is received from time to time, this is a matter so far wh ic hihe
cannot avoid or misrepresent- issue sare made from time to time
during the quarter and memorandums of these issues which
whichare sup
posed to be correct are placed on file at the end of the quarter
no inventory is taken, but a report is made up from these memo
randums.
If these memorandums are apparently incorrect in such
matters as they are cognizant of the y are altered, in order to
make the balance somewhat reasonabde or correct.
In many cases
after filing their statement or prior to it they discover that
nill
they are many things short, or over- these are carried over un
til the next quarter and reported as
" issued, expended, lost, or
