Dear
Sir:
Replying
to your letter
of the 13th, inst., I have the honor
to
report
that my counter
statement
with accompanying
papers
will
go by
next ma 11.
Mrs. Roberts
is improving
slowly

. I have

and assured
her of my kind
wishes

have the impression

been kindly

toward
Mrs.Oulbertson
; I want to assure
you that

with
her for nine years:
our relations
have always
been friendly
; no person
associated
with me
in my school work were not
in the Indian
Service
, has received
so many favors
of me or has been more kindly treated
than she has.
I have felt hurt&
that her daughter
would criticise
the management
of the school as she
has done at various
times, and and cause the discos among the employes
that she has.
Her work in the laundry
was first suggested
by herself':
She was the only employe who could be assigned
to that work at the ti
time.
Since you were here, I have written to several superintendents
to
ftud ascertain whether I pursued a different
plan from the usual custom
Supt.Meserve
says in his letter on the subject," one of the teachers
during July substituted
for the hospital nurse, another teacher for the
matron of the large boys building, still another teschor for the matron
