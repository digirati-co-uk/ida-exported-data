Special officers have
done good work but all the officers in the
Liquor Suppression Buraau, could not stop this traffic when the
Indians have money and a re bent on securing booze, as there are
planty of Mexicans and bums a round the small towns who will supply
their wants. A number of prosecutions and convictions have been
made and a number of cases are pending, but this does not diminish
this curse one bit.
Our pre jent police force of five privates and chief is
wholly inadequate to inforce law and order in an effective or
forcible manner, and dozens of cases of drunkenness must go
unpunished. Whiskey is at the bottom of 90% of all our trouble.
Prohibition in a real sense seems to be the only way in which this
evil can be overcome.
