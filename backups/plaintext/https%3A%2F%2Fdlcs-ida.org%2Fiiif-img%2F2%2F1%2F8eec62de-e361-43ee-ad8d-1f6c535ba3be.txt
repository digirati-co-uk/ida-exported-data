Three of such buildings are schoolhouses and of considerable size.

of times during the past several years justifications urging
the construction of several buildings at the Moqui Agency, to rit;

GUARDHOUSE, of sufficient size for male and female prisoners----
to supplant the present unsanitary hole in which
those prisoners who positively must be confined

in which Nava joes especially could be placed and KEPT.
A plan for such building has been presented to the
Indian office and had approval some time ago.
