- 5-Section 11- HealthNever before in the history of this agency has such anactive health campaign been carried on. Especially areNavajo mothers( prospective) seeking hospital care duringconfinement.Hospitals are needed at both Chin Lee andTohatchi as with such a large territory to cover and over12, 000 Indians two hospitals at the agency cannot take care ofwhat should be done.At the agency one additional physicianand two more nurses are a necessity. A sufficient apportionment for 1917 was not allowed to run the general hospital. Forthe sanatorium with twenty capacity an appropriation of$ 10, 000was allowed, or$ 500 per petient. The general hospital has acapacity of forty and less than$ 200 per patient was allowedwhile its up- keep cost if twice or three times what the sanatorium is, per patient.The position of field matron was vacant a large portionof the year and owing to the Navajos living in widely scatteredcommunities this branch of the work was not as successful as itmight have been.
