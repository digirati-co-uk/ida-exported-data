The old Indian dances are indulged in to a considerable extent. They dance as much, perhaps, as any otherIndian in exestance, Dances as a rule have a ceremonialsignificance or religious significance. Dancing takes placemostly at times when the Indians are not busy with theirwork, such as winter, spring and fall. It does not seem toretard their advancement, industrially or morally, to anygreater extent than does the so- called civilized dances.( a)I think these people should not be prevented fromholding their dances. They are their source ofpleasure, to a great extent, and are firmly believedto bring blessings.( b)The children and returned students view thedances and to considerable extent take part thetainbut the returned students take part more to conformto custom than for any other reason. They do nottake the fances seriously.The Indians under this supervision still follow toa considerable extent the old tribal customs of marriageand divorce( a)It appears that the state laws regard marriageand divorce, according to Indian cust om, to be lagal.()The plan of having all educated young peopleconform to the law in the matter of marriage anddivorce is being enforced.â€¢4.
