from their herds during the coming fall.
These lambs will be used
for breeding purposes at the agency, to raise half- breed rams, for
sale to the Indians at a nominal price of from five to ten dollars
apiece.
It was proposed, through the use of reimbursable funds,
to establish a tribal herd of Herefords for the purpose of rais
ing bulls for sale to the Indians.
This could not be ac
complished during the present year, however.
It is hoped that
the plan can be carried into execution during the coming year,
The purchase of one hundred two- year- old heifers and a limited
number of white face bull, will enable us to raise Hereford
bulls, for sale to the Indians at prices they can afford to
pay.
Distance from the markets and grazing conditions on the
reservation eliminate any thought of the dairy industry.
An excellent dairy herd is maintained at this school.
Several years ago a number of registered Dairy Shorthorn cows
and a very fine registered Dairy Shorthorn bull were parchased
in Ohio and brought to the school. This herd has become one of
the finest dairy herds in the southwest. Surplus stock is sold
to the Indians at reasonable prices and to the ranchors of the
San Juan Valley who are willing to pay the high prices which
stock of this kind carmands to- day.
