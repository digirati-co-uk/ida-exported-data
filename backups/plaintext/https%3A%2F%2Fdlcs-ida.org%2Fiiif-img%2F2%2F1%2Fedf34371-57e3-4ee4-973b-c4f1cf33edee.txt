dNorthern Pueblos AgencySanta Fe, N. M.SECTION IVINDUSTRIES1.All of the Pueblo Indians are primarily farmers oragriculturists: I have attempted for a number of years toimprove their methods of farning, get them to sow morealfalfa in order that they may be better able to care fortheir stock. I have is ned this year 3200 poundo ofalfalfa aeed, and every year during the past four yearshave induced the Indians to plant or seed more alfalfa.This has had a good effect for the Indians have been ableto raise enough hay and forage to keep their stock fairlydecent.2.( a) As above stated, the Indians have betterstock, and they are better cared for thanin past years owing to the increase oftheir alfalfa fielde.( b) Where there has been failure in anyparticular village it has been due to lackof water. Attempts are constantly beingmade to issue more water, especially atSan Ildefonso and Tesuque, but we have metwith only fair success.( c) School gardens and Indian gardens, thecultivation of and the raising of morevegetables has been encouraged in practically all the pueblos and with fairly goodsuccess. Fruit trees have been plantedand issued to Indians in a mimber of thepueblos. The Pueblos have bad a limitedamount of fruit trees for years, but thevariety has been rather poor and Indianshave been slow to properly care for same,especially in the matter of spraying.( d) No regular system of spraying has beenintroduced.( e) Indians dispose of their products in thelocal market.( 1) The Indian does not need to be taught ortold about the saving of seed for planting.The Pueblo Indian learned long before theadvent of the white man, to save seed cornfor at least two years.
