4The Mormons of Tuba City with whom I spoke regarding such anextension of the boundaries of reservation, expressed themselvesas very willing to sell their improvements for a reasonable consideration, and to remove from that section of country.The village of Tuba City, with its abundant supply of excellent water and fine orchards, together with the lands the whitesettlers have under irrigation and cultivation, would afford one ofthe best locations for a large Industrial School for the Navajo,Moqui and Piute Indians, who live in that vicinity, thatcould befound in Arizona.Such an extension of the Reservation boundaries, by purchasing the improvements of the Mormon settlers, would not only givethe Indians the necessary increased area of range for their herds,and prevent to a great extent the frction now existing between theIndians and whites over the comman ranges, but would also settleexisting contentions between the Mormon settlers and Indian allottees around Tuba City over certain of the improved lands in thatlocality.I am, Sir, very respectfully,Your obedient Servant,Jane TokaughlinU. S. Indian Inspector.
