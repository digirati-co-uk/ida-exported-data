Navajo Boarding School.

One great trouble with this school in the past has been, that at
the end of the school year, the children would return to their homes
to spend vacation, when the school opened again the children who have
been members of the school, and had been taught some English and had
obtained a fair start would not return; to fill the school again
the agent has been obliged to take any and all children he could
get, the result has been that each year nearly all the children were
new pupils that never had attended school before and could not
speak a word of English. Some means should be devised to renedy
this evil.
Inthe past the Indians of this reservation have
objected to sending their children to this or any other school, but
during the past few years there has been a marked change in this
respect, at the present time this school, and the school at Little
Water are badly crowded; they have always reluctantly sent a lim
ited number of boys to school, but they have not wanted to send
their girls, and only a few have attended this school, more are in
attendance now than ever before; there have been several valid rea
sons from their point of view why they should not send their girls,
the principal reason is, they sell their daughters when they arrive
at a marriagable age, they have a commercial value, another reason is,
they do not want the girls to attend a mixed school, they want a sep
arate school for girls; most of the girls that have attended this
school in the past have turned out bad, some of them very bad, they
have been the victims of white man, usually some agency or school
employe, or Indian trader, or traders clerk, so when they are asked to
allow the girls to attend the school they allude to these facts, it
is a hard question to debate, as they are right.
I have had a number of conversations with several of the lead
ing Indians during my present inspection, most of them say they would
like to have the girls attend school, they are aware of the benefits
they would derive and admit it, but they want a separate school for
girls located away from the agency and temptation, they generally
speak of Red Lake as a good location which is about 15 miles from
the agency, where it is said there is an abundant supply of water,
