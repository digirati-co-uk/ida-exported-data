6Last July the Agent informs me, there were one hundred and seven[ 107] chiIdren, between the ages of six s[ 3] and sixteen[ 16] years, belongingto this reservation; of that number thirty- three[ 33] are now in schoolat this Agency, and twenty[ 20] are away at some of the Indian schools,off the reservation,He thinks he can without any trole, increasethenumber here, to at least forty[ 40] pupils; he cannot hope to add moregirls, as he has not sufficient dormitory room.Agent Bennett, does not think the total number of children, on the reserva√ºion of school age, that are eligible to attend school will exceed sixtyfive[ 65], as a great number of the boys and girls tarry so young; it isnot uncommon for the girls to marry, at from twelve[ 12] to sixteen( 16)years of age, unless they are away from the camps; this habit of earlymarriage reduces the number of proper children, to attend any school.The school faru consists of fifty[ 507 acres or more, of good land undercultivation; more than thirty( 307 acres are now planted to oats, aboutfifteen[ 15] acres will be planted to corn, the balance used as a garden.A few acres will be this year added to the farm now cultivated.Last year about forty[ 401 tons of oat bay was cut, to feed the schoolsstock; the corn crop was light, not as large as it should have been,owing to the imperfect manner in which the irrigation ditores were constructed.
