Pe 14.Loupp, irizona.seotion IV-- Industrion.( oont.)Aon STM HTao Tna MTAAHHOThe future outlook for stock raising is only modoratoiy favorable, unless the Indiens improve the qualityof their stoot, especially the shoop and cattle.The presence of atook belonging to whito men 1very detrimental to the best interests of the Indians attimes. To prevent this injury, I would recommend that afonoo be built on the south and the east side of theroservation, whlon is believed would keep the outside stookfrom ooming on the peature that should be protected for theIndians.Many of the Navajo Womon are engaged in blanketweaving, and the outlook for this industry is very encouraging, as the demand for suon goods te constant and the prio.received is usually good.There are no returned students on this reservation.The time of the former is put in caring for theschool farm, garden and stook. We have no expert farmers.The Indians employed here consist of two laborers,one carpenter, five police, two judges, and quite a numberof other Indians are given work from time to time haulingfreight, and do ing other that can not be accomp11shed by theregular school foroe. For the latter work, suoh as preperingirrigation ditches, olearing land for cultivation, etc. theIndians are paid with wagons and harne 88, sold to them at cost.
