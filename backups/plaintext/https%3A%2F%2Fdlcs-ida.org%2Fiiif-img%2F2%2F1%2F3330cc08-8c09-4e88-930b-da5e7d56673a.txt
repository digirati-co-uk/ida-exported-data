Sec. 2. Health
Health conditions have not improved during the
year, 51 deaths having occurred, or about of the tribe.
Three- fourths of this number vere minors, or Indians un
der thirty- five years of age, many caused by improper at
tention at childbirth, and the most by their not having
the necessary degree of vitality to resist disease. A
large percentage of Indians are in a more or less tuber
cular condition, due, I believe, to the fact that in form
years they have lived in poorly Ventilated hores, sur
mised from the factsthat the older Indians, who are used
to living in tents and spending most of their time out of
doors, are much healthier than the younger generation.
It is hoped that the current year will show a
marked improvement in health conditions, as well venti
lated houses are being built, and windows, doors and
floors placed in homes that warrant the same; and the
Indians are showing a great interest in these improve
ments. Then funds are aailable it is intended to
purchase chairs, beds toads, matt resses, etc., which
will be introduced into the houses to teach the Indi as
to sit instead of squatting in cramped positions at basket
or bead work, and to sleep in sanitary beds instead of
upon the ground with unsanitary sheepskins and a mass of
dirty blankets and rugs under and above thon.
The mortality could be materially decreased if
the Indians vould put more faith in the officacy of the
white physician's remedies, and would call for him be
fore the disease had reached a hopeless state.
