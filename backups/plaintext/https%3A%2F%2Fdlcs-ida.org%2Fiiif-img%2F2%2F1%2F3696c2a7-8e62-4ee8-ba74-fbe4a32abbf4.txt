FACES
Small features make up a face
the ears, eyes, nose, mouth
We perceive it individually
Ã¡ll interpreted as one
The ears, eyes, nose, mouth
MST, Humanities, Dorms, EAC
all interpreted as one
all elements of the Santa Fe Inidan School
MST, Humanities, Dorm, EAC
we all live and belong
all elements of the Santa Fe Indian School
Getting to know other faces
We all live and belong
Growing, Sharing, Giving
Getting to other faces
Till we are the Senior class
Growing, Sharing, Giving
Reminiscing the faces of the first day
Till we are the Senior class
Small features make up a face
