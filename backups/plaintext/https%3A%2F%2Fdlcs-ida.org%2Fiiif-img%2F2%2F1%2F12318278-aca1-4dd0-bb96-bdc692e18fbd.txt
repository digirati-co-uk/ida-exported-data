Health( Continued)Hopi Indian AgencyOwing to our intensive trachome campaign and community health workduring the past year, we have tried using field ma trons in close cooperationwith the medical authorities of the reservation and especially to do followup work suggested and ordered by Dr. Ross. We have placed these field matronsat the differ at day schools so that they could look after those pupils rogularly. This plan has been very effective, cutting down trachome considerably at each one of these districts not only among the adults but the childrenas well. A remarkable record at one of these schools this year was madethrough the fact that trachoma was cut to one case among about 90 pupils andSoveral madred adults. This elimination of trachoma among pupils which eachnight go home to their homes where they come in contact with more or lesstrac home come s entirely a bout through the health work of the ma tron and principal of this one school. We are trying to emulate this example at the otherday so hools and at our boarding school.Respectfully submitted,AiShin,EKM: WVEdex K. Miller, Supt.
