Sir:
I have the honor to recommend
that steps be taken to increase
the
number
of children
in this school.
Under date of April 25th, I wrote to
your Office suggesting
that the new pupils be draw from the SanCarlos
and Jicarilla
reservations
. In the right or recent developments
, I do no
think it wise to bring any more San Carlos children to this school.
of the 32 that Supervisor
Keck brought here on the 15th of last Novem
ber, two have died at school, two have been sent home, one of whoni has sin
died four others at school, are artected pith lung trouble and the school
physician recommends that they be sent home.
I think with the assistance of Agent Robertson, I shall be able to se
cure a number of children from the Jicarilla reservation.
I would advise that the remainder of the quota for the school be seenal
from the Pueblos and the Navajasreservation
.
Very respectfylly,
Iller
Super intendent.
