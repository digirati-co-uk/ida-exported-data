Dysentery is in evidence among these people. There is not
much Trachoma and not a great deal of Tuberculosis, though both
conditions require constant attention.
During the past year there were small epidemics of Mumps,
Chicken pox and German Measlea, but the cases were of a light
form.
Gonococci infection has become very noticeable among these
people, but due to their clami shness, it is difficult to obtain
much information from them regarding such things. Most of them
will accept treatment for this condition, but will not consider
hospitalization.
The health work on this reservation is primary one of educa

quarters for the nurse is badly needed.
It is found that many small children are in need of dental
work. This type of patient can be gotten easily during the school:
year, but during the summer months they are so scattered on out
iying farms that it is difficult to get them.
A great many school children need glasses. A Special Physi
cian should be sent here early in the fall to correct the usual
disturbances of this type, the glasses purchased by the govern
ment and used by the children only while in school.
