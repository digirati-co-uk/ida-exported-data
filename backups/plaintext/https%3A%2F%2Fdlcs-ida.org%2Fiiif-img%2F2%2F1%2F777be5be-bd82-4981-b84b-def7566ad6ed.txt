Page 21NARRATIVE.Annual report- 1915Section- Viil-- Contracts.Once a year a business council of all the mostintelligent members of the tribe of both sexes is called. Thiscouncil is held at some convenient time for the discussion ofsuch topics as may be of common interest to the tribe and fortheir better welfare. The court of Indian offenses also meetsonce a month and at such times a considerable number come tothe Agency on business and at these meetings various subjectsare discussed. Among the topite rae plural marriages; homebuilding; improvement of stock; development of water;additional school facilities for their children, etc. I findthat these councils are an important factor in securing thecooperation of the Navajos in matters of this kind. A veryclose cooperation was had with all the leading Navajos duringthe past year and splendid results along the above lines werehad.No per capita payments have ever been made thistribe which I consider a blessing in disguise.
