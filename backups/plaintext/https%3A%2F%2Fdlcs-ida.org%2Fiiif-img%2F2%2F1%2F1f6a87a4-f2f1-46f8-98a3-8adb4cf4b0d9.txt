Dear
sir
:
I have
authority
to come
to your
reservation
to get
children
for
this
school
.
Although
you
wired
me some
time
ago
that
none
could
be secured
, I should
be very
glad
to secure
some
if possible
,
Do you
think
it would
be an advantage
for me
to
bring
one
of the largest
boys
from
our school
to the reservation
to assist
in securing
childrens
I should
be
glad
to get
at
least
ten
or fifteen
children
from
your
reservation
,
Very
respectfully
,
mi
Superintendent
,
