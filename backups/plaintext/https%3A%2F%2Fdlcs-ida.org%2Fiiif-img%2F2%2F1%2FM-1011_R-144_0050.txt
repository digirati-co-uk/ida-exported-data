Annual Report, 1910- Springfield School
Education Division- Health Section
The Sup erintendent in a general statement reports:
The health of the schod has been very good and
there was practically no sickness of moment among the
pupils until to wards the very close of the year when
two cases of tuberculosis developed. One of these was
a girl who had never been very rugged, and the other was
one who had always enjoyed excellent health, and indeed
showed no symptoms of being unwell in any way until she
was suddenly taken with a slight hemorrhage. Both these
pupils were at once removed to their homes, there fortu
nately being no smaller children in either family to take
the contagion. Each of them carried with them a pamphlet
put out by the Government on the treatment of consumption
and precautions to be taken. I am in hopes that some day
there may be a general sanatarium where such cases maybe
placed, and I am confident that until some such institu
tion is provided that there is little hope of eradicating
tuberculosis from amongst the Indians. It is encouraging
however, to note from the conversation of pupils and their
parents that there is a growing feeling among the Indians
of the danger of the disease and of its contagia s char
acter
In addition to the above mentioned cases of tuber
culosis we had one case of pneumonia, not a severe one,
and the patient made a rapid recovery. Mumps in a miid
form also invaded the school, but required 1ittle treatment
and all recovered in a short time.
