When they know definitely what lands willbe alotted them, they will take a still greater interest intheir farming operations. They will be justified in puttingpermanent improvements thereon and in moving out of the villageSo far this has not been done, owing to the uncertainty of wheretheir holding in the future will be,( d) I reconunend that the grazing land on the reservation benot alotted, but allowed to remain tribal land as at present forthe rees on that on account of the topography of the country, thescarcity of grass and water and the small amount of land thatcould alotted per capita, a grazing alottment would be of no individual value, but on the contrary would in all probability result in considerable trouble and strife and a hardship to themajority of the tribe, provided the valleys and water holes orsprings were fenced up.
