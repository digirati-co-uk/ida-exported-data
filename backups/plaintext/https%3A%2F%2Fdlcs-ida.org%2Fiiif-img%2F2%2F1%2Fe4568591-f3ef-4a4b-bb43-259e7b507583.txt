Marcelino" We have just sky light."
Kilguy
" Have just one window.",
Roy" We sleep outside; we just come in the hogan when it rains,
We talked about why we had windows in the houses,
Somo
of them do not think that Hogans should have windows. Somo
drew their hogans with windows, and some did not.
All the children like to sit on the one chair we have
in the hogan. George said," Get some more chairs,
that kind,
to sit on," on the floor, 1t is too cold."
