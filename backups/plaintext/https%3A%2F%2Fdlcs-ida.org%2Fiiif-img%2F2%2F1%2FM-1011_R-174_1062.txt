Farmer' s Report.Page 2.The ojo Caliente settlement has the longest growingseason, because of its lower altitude, of any portion ofthe Reservation. Here the water supply is from permanent springs and a storage reservoir where the water fromthe springs is impounded during the winter, the late falland early spring when not needed for irrigation. The landis quite fertile and about one thousand acres are undercultivation. Alfalfa, wheat, beans corn and wild grasseswith garden products are produced and experimental orchardshave shown that some fruit can be successfully grown. Someof the most fertile lands are water- logged and by drainageand development, which it is hoped may be undertaken by theIrrigation Department, the cultivated area could be doubled.A brief history of farming on the Zuni Reservation ma yhelp in explaining present conditions and problems. Zunis Wwere carrying on a system of irrigation and dry farmingmethods when the white man' arrived upon the scene. Smallstreams were diverted and canals were run to springs toobtain water for irrigation. Dry farm crops were plantedat the mouth of canyons and where arroyas deposited the irhumus laden silt during the flood season. At each of theoutlying settlements Ojo Caliente, Nutria and Pescada, aresprings that furnish as much as one second foot of water each.Here the Zunis planted crops but always returned to the central Zuni Pueblo after harvest time. They acrried the grainwith them but left behind valuable forage and roughage. In1908, the Blackrock dam was completed and canals run for tehmiles through the valley upon which the â€œ uni Pueblo was located while schools were located only at the Pueblo thusmaking it necessary for the ones who farmed on the outlyingsettlements to return early in the fall and remain until latesprings at this central village. The soil of the centralvillage and in the valley is not as fertile as upon the othersettlements and such congested living is not conducive to theraising of gardens or the keeping of milch cows and chickensas could be done in the outer settlements. The ones whomoved to the central village for winter abandoned their farmsuntil spring. No fertilizer was hauled, fences and farmswere neglected while the time during the winter months whichcould have been given to more gainful Work, was spent indancing and entertaining. It became aparent to the one shaving the problem of looking after the Indians and withthese conditions to face, if nealth conditions were to beImproved, a better diet furnished and better farming donethat encouragement should be given for permanent occupancyof their homes upon the outer settlements. Many of the Zunisare successful sheep men and, differing from the Navajos,they herd their sheep away from the home and travel fromplace to place as pasturage is afforded. The ones livingat the settlements herd their sheep in that section and withall their activities concentrated there, it was most unfortunate that the moving habit of so many years should still befollowed with its resultant disorganization. For, a numberof years, Agenoy employers who worked with the adult Indians
