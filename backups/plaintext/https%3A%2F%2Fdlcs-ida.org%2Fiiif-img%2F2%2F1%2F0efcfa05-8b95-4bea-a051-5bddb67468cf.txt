The Deer and the FoxBy DOROTHY BOWMAN( Navajo)Once there lived a deer and a fox in the woods. The deer lived with herfamily. She had two little deer. They were pretty with spots on their backs.The fox had a family, too. She had six little ones, but they didn' t have anyeyes yet. One day she went down to see the deer' s family. She asked the deerhow she made her children pretty. The deer said she would tell her if shewould do that to her children when she got home. The deer told the foxthat she shut her fawns in a cave and built a fire of corn cobs in the cave.Then she shut the cave up so no smoke could escape. After all the smokeand fire was gone, she entered and found her children with spots on their backs,and they looked very pretty. After the deer finished the story, the fox saidshe was going to do that to her children.When she got home she shut up her little ones in a cave and built a bigfire of corn cobs just as the deer had told her. She shut the cave up so thatno smoke could escape. She waited a long time outside the cave for the fire togo out. While the fox was doing all those things, the deer and her familyran away to another country where the fox could not find them.When the fire was out the fox entered the cave and called to her littleones. No answer came. They did not move. She started to cry and ran outto find the deer, but the deer had gone far away.
