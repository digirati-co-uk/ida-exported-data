O
Due to the crowded condition of the school the auditorium had
been divided into four pens by means of partitions extending half
way to
the ceiling.
The music, art and third grade shared the
same room with my class.
It was almost impossible to hear the indivi
dual child speak.
During the Christmas holidays a modernistio hogan was built for
my class,
It was a delightful place and the children re- entered
school after the Christmas holidays with renewed enthusiasm.
It
was at this point that I launched into my major unit" BBLEER HEALTH"
which lasted until the close of school in June.
I divided this subjeot into Ten Divisions namely; EXERCISE,
DISEASE, CL ANLINESS, EYES HAIR, THE TH, SIEJP, FOODS, FIRST AID,
and SANIRARY HOME LIFE,
Handwork Activities
Three sand- table projects were made in the duration of this unit.
The first represented EXERCISE.
The boys made playground apparatus
such as swings, merry- go- rounds, giant- strides, monkey rings, spring
boards, slides and bars.
The girls made small dolls cut out of
muslin and dressed as boys and girls.
The class enjoyed the minature
playground which was a reproduction of the place where they received
their exercise.
The second sand- table project was made during the study of Foods,
It represented a modern dairy farm. It included a mina ture house,
barn, garage, pasture, railroad station where' trains were standing
to receive the milk brought from the farm in trucks.
