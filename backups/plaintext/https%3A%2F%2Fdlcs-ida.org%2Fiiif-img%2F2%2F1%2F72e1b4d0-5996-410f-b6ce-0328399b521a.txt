has never had any claim, and does not want to take from his friend Nebekerwho has always been a good neighbor to him.The other Indians want itonly because it has been allotted to them, and because the Agents tellthem it is now theirs;to go and take it.I know that portions of this land have been rented to differentIndians for a number of seasons, or rather it might be said that theyhave worked portions of it on shares, and the agreements were alwaysfaithfully kept on both sides so long asI was there.As a general rulethe relations of the whites and Indians there have always been friendlyuntil agents and sub- agents and farmers, so called, commenced to comethere, since which time difficulties and controversies have been cons tant.I am not related to Mr. Nebeker in any degree, and have notthe slightest interest in his claim, directly or indirectly.Subscribed and sworn to before me this second day of June, 1898Lasy SmithN.
