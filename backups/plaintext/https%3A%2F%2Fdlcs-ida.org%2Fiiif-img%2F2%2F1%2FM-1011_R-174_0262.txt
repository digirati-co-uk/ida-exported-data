ANNUAL REPORT
1919
SECTION 1,--
Law& Order,
The Zuni Agency and Boarding school are located
45 miles south of Gallup, New MÅ¿exico and 4 miles east of
the Zuni Pueblo, on the south bank of the Zuni River. The
buildings, most of them, are constructed of red sandstone
and are in a good state of repair. More buildings are
greatly needed. What we have are entirely insufficient for
the securing of best results. The Agency is in need of
buildings as follows:
A cottage for the use of the physician. The
physician at this Agency has so far, always been compelled
to occupy rented adobe quarters of the crudest character
It is found to be impossible to rent any building which
would be in any way suitable for his occupancy. During
the past year two physicians have resigned at this Agency,
giving as one of the principal reasons," unsuitable living
quarters."
A snall building is also needed for use of
physician as a dispensary and consultation quarters. At
present a simall room is used for this purpose in the house
used as physicians' quarters. This condition is very un
satisfactory
