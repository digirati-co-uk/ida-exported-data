Message To Youth
This message is written on behalf of the entire staff of Santa Fe Indian
School. It is given to you with high hope and positive convictions
that the
majority of you want to continue your education.
Tou live in a world of great potential, but it is a very demanding world.
It is a world which says straightaway

world.
The good qualities of youth are many and adequate. You have ambition,
faith, industry, and the desire to do the right thing. Fashion these traits
