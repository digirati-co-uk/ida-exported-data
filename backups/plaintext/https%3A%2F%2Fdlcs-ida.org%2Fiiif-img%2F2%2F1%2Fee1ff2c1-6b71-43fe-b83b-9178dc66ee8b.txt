SCHOOLS.
Pueblo Bonito.
Public Schools are not within reach of the Davahog
as settlement by whites is sparce and it will perhaps be
meny years before they will have such advantage, and
the greatest problem before the Indian Office is to
provide more and ample boarding schools within
the Indian Country
.
You will find with such a plan
cartried out will meet with favor by the Navahos, and it
is with reluctawce that they permit the wholsale sending
away of children, rgerdless of their real wish, or the
age of the pupil and be weaned away from their fathers
and mothers, is it any wonder, that they object.
The Office should secure such an appropiation
large enough to provide facilities to care for every
eligible child in the Indian Country within the shortest
period possible, and it would be possible to solve the
Educational problem in the shortest period of time.
Parties of children have been urged to go to
distant schools, they become dissatisfied and the result
is they run off and perhaps do not reach home for
several months, about one half of the boys sent to
Sherman and Hagkell have left there and I believe that
if schools were provided near home there would be little
trouble of this nature. The brighter boys and girls
should go on to the higher education but those who lack
special capacity for loaming could go back home after
completeing a sixth grade education and be better satisfied
than if he had been out in the world and learned
extravegant ideas and habits and may become a failure.
The Academic work of theschool here was of the
best in character and believe the results
attaned
have not been exceeded in the previous years of the
school work.
