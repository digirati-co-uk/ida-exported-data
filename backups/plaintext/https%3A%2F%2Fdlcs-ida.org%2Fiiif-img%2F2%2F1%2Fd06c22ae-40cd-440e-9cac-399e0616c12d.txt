...... School
.
The school
is located
one and one- half miles
northwest
of
Albuquerque
, the largest
city in New Mexico
, and in the fertile
valley
of the Rio Grande
. There
is a possibility
and I believe
a probability
that the city limits
of Albuquerque
may be ex
tended
in the near future
to take
in the Indian
school
as well
as other
adjacent
territory
.
The altitude
is 4, 949 feet.
The climate
is dry, cool and healthful
and very
satisfactory
for Indian
children
of the southwest
.
The winters
are mila
and the summers
are not extremely
warm. No better
climatic
or health
conditions
can be found
for the Pueblo
, Navajo
,
Zuni, Hopi
and Apache
Indians
of New Mexico
and Arizona
.
The enrollment
for the year
was 552,-- 294 boys
and 258
girls. The average
attendance
was 525, representing
tribes
as follows
:
