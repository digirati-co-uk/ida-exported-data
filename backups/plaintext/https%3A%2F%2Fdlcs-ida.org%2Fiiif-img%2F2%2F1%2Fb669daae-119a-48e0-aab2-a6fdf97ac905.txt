Allwe used it for during the influenza epidemic was as a morgue.There is need of a building in which to conduct the public school.Last year I assigned one of the vacant cottages for this purpose,but it is poorly adapted to school purposes. It is easier tohold employees if they have a school where they can send theirchildren.
