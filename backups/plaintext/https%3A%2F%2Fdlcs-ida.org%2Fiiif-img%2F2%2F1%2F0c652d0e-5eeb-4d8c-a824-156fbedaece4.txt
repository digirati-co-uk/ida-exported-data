Section II---- Health.
Annual Report, 1914.
Mount Pleasant Indian school.
The general health conditions at the school are good. Hearty
co- operation between the matrons and physician has done a great deal
to lirait the spread of all contagious or infectious diseases. The
new lavatories are completed and in good condition, and are very
sanitary and clean.
Trachoma at the school is decreasing. The cases which we have
are nearly all new pupils who bring it with them from their homes
or those who contract it when home on vacation. Tuberculosis is
recognized in only about 20% of the pupils and every precaution is
taken to prevent contagion and to make an early diagnosis. Where
possible early cases are sent to a tuberculosis sanatorium.
The teeth of the children have been sadly neglected as there
has been no provision for their care by a local dentist, and up to
the present time no government dentist has visited the school. Some
of the pupils can get money from their parents to have their teeth
attended to, but as there is no provision for inspection of the
teeth, the conditions in the mouths of most of the pupils are so
bad that extraction is usually necessary. It is suggested that an
inspection and treatment of the teeth of the pupils be made at least
once a year, and twice a year would be better.
The out door play grounds do much to keep the pupils out of
doors and in the fresh air. Respiratory disease is on the decrease
and perhaps largely due to this reason; therefore, we are extending
the playgrounds as much as possible and are encouraging their use
by the pupils.
