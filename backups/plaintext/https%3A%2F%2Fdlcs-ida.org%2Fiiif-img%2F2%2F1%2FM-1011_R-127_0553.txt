Annual Report,Industry- 13.Santa Fe Schooland Agencya farmer at their pueblo The Santo Domingo pueblo withits 90, 000 odd acres of land and its present reactionarytendencies does not at the present time begin to utilizethe resources of this large body of land, In my opiniona very considerable increase in the agricultural acreagecould be secured by improved irrigation methods. I thinkit would be unwise to take up definitely with the SantoDomingo Indians the proposition of establishing a farmerin their pueblo until the position has been established,From the general talks which I had with the council andindividual Indians, I think that just at this time theywould oppose such a moveI feel that the establishment of a farmer atSanto Domingo in the fact of the opposition by the pueblois quite a different matter than the establishment of aday school in the face of their opposition The attendance of Indian children in the school under the state law,which I believe applies to the Indiana, is a matter ofcompulsion, whereas, in my opinion no good would accruefrom forcing a farmer upon the Indians in the face of theiroutspoken opposition. Although the Santo Domingo Indianswould probably resent the establishment of a farmer in theirpueblo at present, it is my belios that, 18 they would notaccept the idea of a farmer now, their observation of thedefinite material assistance which would be rendered theirno lghbors, the Cochits Indians, through the work carried on bythe farmer would open their eyes within a year or two to thebenefit they would derive from a farmer in their own pueblo.There is a large fiOld for a farmer at Taos TheTaos Indians are generally intelligent and industrious andwill be very glad of the assistance, which will be extendedto them in having a farmer work wi th them. There is considerable acreage at Taos at prosent undoveloped, a watersupply being available under the present eyeten of ditchesfor a large part of the land I feel that a great deal couldbe done through the efforts of the farmer in putting thisland into crops The supervizi on by the farmer theof stallions and bulls in breeding up the Taos Indian poniesand cattle would also be of great meaterial benefit to thepueblo
