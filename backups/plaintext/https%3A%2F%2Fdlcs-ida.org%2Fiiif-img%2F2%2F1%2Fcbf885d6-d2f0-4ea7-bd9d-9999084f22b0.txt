Section IV- Industries
Annual Report 1913
MON
The Navajo Indians of this reservation,
numbering about ten thousand, are tenders of flocks
and weavers of blankets. Their cattle, horses and
sheep range over portions of New Mexico and Arizona.
These Indians are pastoral people and not farmers, al
though every family has a small piece of ground where
they grow corn, hay and vegetables. These small farms
are irrigated by flood waters from melting snow in the
mountains. Owing to the lack of snow some years their
crops are short. A great amount of snow fell during the
past winter but up to the present time but little rain has
fallen this spring. These people are pro gressive and
intelligent. Not considering crops, the Navajos derive
from the sales of wool, stock and blankets, nearly$ 500, 000
annually. Farming does not appearl to the Navajo very
strongly, although more land is being cultivated each
year, which is very encouraging.
The stock industry
is their greatest source of income; everything is being
done to improve this industry thatis possible. Two
hundred rams were purchased by the Government and issued,
for labor and three hundred more purchased individually
by the Indians. These were all Rambouiletts. Fifty bulls
and four stallions were also purchased. All are being
used to splendid advantage in the upbreeding of Indian stock.
