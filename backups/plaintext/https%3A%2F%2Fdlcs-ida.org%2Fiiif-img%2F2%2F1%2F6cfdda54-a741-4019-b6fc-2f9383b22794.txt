Favorable phases of the Curriculum
The most favorable phase of the curriculum for the Eastern
Navajo School as it now stands to me is the emphasis placed
upon giving the Nava jo child work based upon his needs; some
thing that will function in his daily life after he leaves
school; something he can look upon as a definite good gained
while in school.
Too often in the past the work given him has been along,
traditional lines with emphasis upon subject matter.
could find no definite connection between what he had learned
in school and his 11 fe among his own people. The result was
that he shed this extraneous knowledge as he would a garment;
he proceded to forget as rapidly as possible. In other words
he went" back to the blanket!!
This is not true of the pupil in the large non- reservation
boarding school who found a place for himself in the industrial
life of the outside world. However it has been true, in my ex
perience, of the child who attended the reservation school only.
Other favorable phases of the curriculum are:
1. The emphasis placed upon health and sanitation.
2. Emphasis upon care of the range; improvement of the herd.
3. Emphasis upon oral English.
4. Emphasis upon silent reading.
5. Emphasis upon home membership. the need for kindness and
understanding in the home,
