The Indians throughout this territory maltetheir living by regular lɛ bor on the ranches, in sheep shearing,and all ordinary labor about the towns and in the families ofwhite people. There are no dher industries worthy of mention.Some of them do make a few baskets but not to any considerableeatent. I doubt if the Office conia be of any special use totliese Indians in giving instruction al. Ong industrial lines outside of those mentioned above as the demand for labor along otherlines is limited. As to efforts toward self- support, these Indians have always supported themselves and have never received anylielp from the Government outside of school facilities for theirchildren. There being no tribel 1. anäs, of course, there are nograzing lees es. Many of the allotments are not improved at allbecause they are not worth improving, but wherever there is agricultural land and a water right, the Indians usually have fairfences and building that are reasonably comfortable.REGARDING INDIAN TRADERS.Iliere being no reservation and the all.
