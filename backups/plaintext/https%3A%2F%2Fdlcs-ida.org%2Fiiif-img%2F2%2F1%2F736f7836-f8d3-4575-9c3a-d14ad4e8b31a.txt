We cannot think that a government employee of one of these schools would drag a seven- yearold Indian boy from his home, take him to a boarding school, andthere give him a severe whipping during his first day in school. Itsimply never happened.Neither can we think that an Indian boy would be so stubbornas to refuse to salute the United States Flag. All Indian boys thatwe know are patriotic.Pueblo girls say that the parents do not arrange the marriagesof their daughters. They marry whom they wish to marry.The music given by the vitaphone was good, especially the musicaccompanying the Indian dances; but we cannot conceive of HopiIndians furnishing the music for a Navajo dance.An Indian boy who had won many honors in athletics and ascholarship which entitled him to free tuition in college would receive the same respect as a white boy who had won such honors. Thescene at the party in which Redskin was grossly insulted by( socalled) white friends who were snobs and cads, is overdrawn and addsnothing to the picture.The treatment that Redskin received from his parents and Indianfriends when he returned home from boarding school is not thetreatment given returned students.llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll-||-|--|-|-|-|-llllINNI-----------llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll------lll|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| ———-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|||-!|-|-|-||-|-|-|||-- N1Page Fifty- five
