Hon.
Commissioner Indian Arratrs,
Washington, D. Go
Santa Fe, N. M. January 21, 1891.
I have the hanour In comootion with my endorsoinont, ot kr. G. H.
Lamar's application for the superintendenay of the Albuquerque School
to state, that he is a man of the highost moral character, is bright
and zealous in his work, and in my opinion would make a fint Class
man in charge of that school, he is an honorable man quiet but firma,
P
and in every respect is well equiped for that position,
I would however ask you not to presurne by my endorsement that I
desire the transfer of the Kindergarten Teacher from Albuquerque
should ur. Lamar receive promotion, I have only soon that lady once
and do not know enough about her, to say that she would fill the posi
tion here, on the contrary I have sericus doubts about it, as I am
sure she is not as good a Mugiolan as alrs. lanar, and I ab20 lutely
need a kindergarten teacher who is a good mesto tan, or the appointment
of a music teacher for my school become an absoluto necessity.
Very respectfully,
ener
Supt.& Speel. Diss. Agent.
