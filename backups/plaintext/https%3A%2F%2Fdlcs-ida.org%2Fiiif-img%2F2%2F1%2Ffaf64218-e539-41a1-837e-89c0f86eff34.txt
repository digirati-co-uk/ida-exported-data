Narrative.. Leupp Indian School& Agenoy.Section------- IV---- Industries.Stock industry is the principal means of livelihood for theseIndians, and it is extremely doubtful whether these Indianswill ever be any thing else than stock raisers, of horses,cattle and sheep. Very 11ttle of the land of the Navajoes isagricultural or farming land-- altho here and there smallpatches may be found upon which corn and vegetables can beraised, but the area is small indeed when compared with thewhole of the land occupied by the Indians.This( Navajo) Extension was set aside by Executive orderof Nov. 14, 1901, until such time as the Indians should be aallotted.No steps have been taken to make these allotments and asa matter af fact it will be impossible for any of the Indiansto live upon the land that they will be entitled to. Thosewho have flocks of sheep( most of the Indians have) wouldfind it impossible if their allotments were fenced, to subsisttheir herds upon their allotments. If their allotments weredoubled it is doubtful whether these Indians could eke out aliving if compelled to remain on the land.
