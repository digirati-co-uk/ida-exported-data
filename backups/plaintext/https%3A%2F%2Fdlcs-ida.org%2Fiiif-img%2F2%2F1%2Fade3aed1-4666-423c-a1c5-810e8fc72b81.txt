-25In future development, it may be found advisableto use a string of two inch tubing with packer locatedat the top of the sand in order to secure satisfactoryproduction and take advantage of what gas is present inthe sand in making the wells flow.FURTHER REMARKS ON ACCUMULATION.Considerable discussion has been going on since thediscovery of oil in the Rattlesnake structure, as to whythere should be accumulationof oil at this point, whenboth the Tocito and Table Mega structures have beenfound barren in the Dakota sandstone.Prior to the lease sale in Santa Fe, the Rattlesnakestructure was not looked upon with very much favor, onaccount of its close proximity to the old plug, Shiprock,and because of the possibility that the Hogback structuremight possibly cut it off from drainage area to the east,At the morning session of the sale the Rattlesnake tractwas offered but was passed, no interest being shown in itwhatever. It was offered aga in in the afternoon and wasalmost passed when Mr. s. C. Munoz bid it in for$ 1,000.What was consideredthe premier structureof all,the Tocito, has been found productiveof water only.Table Mesa, second of importance, has secured nothingbut water. Apparentlythe line of reasoning responsiblefor the geologist'sdecisions in regard to these structures is at fault, which once more is indicativeof thegreat amount of investigationand research that must beaccomplishedby the technical man before he may proclaimproficiencyin ability to say that this structure willbe productive, and that one un productive because of thepresence or non- presence of certain genetic quantities.Hogback, Rattlesnake, Tocito and Table Mesa are allsimilarly located, with some exceptions. All are locatedstratigraphicallythe same with the exception of Table Mesa,which has 525 feet of Mancos shale on top the Tocitosandstone. Because of their situationstratigraphicallythe same formationsare involved in the folding and surelythe same mother source of the oil was present.The only differencesin the structures which areworthy of mention, are their elevations and locationswith respect to possible barriers to oil migration.
