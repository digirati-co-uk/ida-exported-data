ministers of the towa took turns in talking to the atire student body.
This is a popular an beneficial service and consists of singing, the
Lord' s Prayer, Scripture reading, and always a good, sensible talk
by the minister.
The disciplinarian has held meetings once a month of the officers
of the boys' battalion for the discussion of subjects influencing dis
cipline and now and then has served light refreshments at such meet
ings. The results have been good. Similar meetings have been held
by the matron with the officers of the girls' battalion and with sim
ilar and equally good results.
