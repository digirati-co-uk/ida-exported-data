1-25NARRATIVE.SECTION 4 INDUSTRIES.Annual Report1914.San Juan School and Agency.The best samples of native corn exhibited by the Indians at the Industrial Fairs held here are procured, planted and cultivated with a view of securing distinct varietiesand demonstrating which kinds are most valuable.Nativebeans from different sections of the reservation are plantedand watched with interest; those proving to be most profitable are saved, while the cultivation of others is discontinued.Practically every family of Indians on the reservationcultivate crops of some kind, sometimes small, but usuallysufficient to do throughout the year.These consist mostly of corn, beans, pumpkins, squashes, melons and some alfalfa and wheat.Most of the farming is carried on, backin the foot hills of the different mountains where snowand rain water can be caught and diverted for irrigation.If there is a reasonable amount of snowfall in the winterand a few rains in the spring and summer, good crops arealways produced.I am pleased to report that these Indians, this yearare raising better crops than ever before.They will produce almost as much again grain as they have heretofore;
