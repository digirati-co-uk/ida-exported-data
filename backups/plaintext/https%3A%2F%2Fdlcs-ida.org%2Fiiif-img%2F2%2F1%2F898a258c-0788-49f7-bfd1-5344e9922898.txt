>0INDUSTRIES,ANNUAL REPORT,1924.Page 5.NARRATIVE.Pueblo Bonito.The desert Indians follow the same practice of dryand irrigation farming peculiar to the conditions theyhave to meet in an extremely dry country. Their farmsare usually located at the mouth of some canyon or whereand aroya spreads out. The winter moksture is coserved undera coat of sand so at planting time the Indians plant deepand corn comes up and thrives until the rainy season tho sometimesthe crop suffers from arouth, tho we usually have some rain inJuly, thot last year some localities received very littleand the range and crops were and the Indian sttokien had tofind feed elsewhere and always causes more or less argumentwhen they range their stock on some other range that his neighbor claims.The school farm consists of about 20 acres irrigated from3 artesian wells and we have averaged$ 2,000. worth of vegetablesand hay for several years. A dipping panatis operated fromthe water supply and several thousand head of sheep, goatshorses and cattad water there daily.Every year all sheep receive a general dipping andif found infected thet are double dipped. The Office authorizedthe construction of 3 new plants and with the construction ofone more in district one, this jurisdiction will be perhapsthe best equipped of any in the Navaho country.There has been a large amount of work for the Indiansand we were not able to supply all the help that was needed,for Railroad Construction, track work, lumber camps, highwayconstruction and operation of rock crushing plants forhighway and railroad. The Indians rebuilt the Mariano Lakedam and protected the face with brush and rock also theLargo Leke in the same manner and for the time being they aresafe from washing out. This is the first time in 15 yearsthat the Largo lake has not gone dry.The Indian Department should make a supreme effortto secure the extension of the Navaho reservation to the eastand south, and if Congress at the next session really wantsto do justice to the Public Domain Navaho, they will havea fine opportunity.
