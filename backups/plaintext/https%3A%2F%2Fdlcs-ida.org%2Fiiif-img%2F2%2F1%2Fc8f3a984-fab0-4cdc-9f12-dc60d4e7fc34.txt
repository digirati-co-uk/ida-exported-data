I have the honour tomreply that on submisting the plan to an expert
builder who is acquainted with the cost of material and labor in this
country be submits an estimate 5 cost of construction under the plan
furnished which far exc990&
$ 2500.
I will further call your attention to the fact that in this high alt..
tude and on account of the very high price of lutner( of a very infe.
rior qualityt there is seldom seen a frano house in the sideing lumber
even at the very high price named in the estimate is of such Huality
ser
that a tight houea canos he built with it, Brick, 3tone ar A help
er and better in the end.
I see no possible means or building the Hospital with the amount&
T

submi. ed.
And as we shall need the building early and have but little time to
work at it beforo scheel opens request an early decision and authority
