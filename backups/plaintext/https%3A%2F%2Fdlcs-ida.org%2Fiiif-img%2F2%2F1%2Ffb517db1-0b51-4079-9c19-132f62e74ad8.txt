O0--/ 3days to sports, games etc. that all, old and young ajoy asdoes the white man his holiday. These days are for the mostpart spent in clean refreshing games and sports. The onesport of the Indian that is to be discouraged above others1s the chicken race following the San Juan Day exercises.This 18 brutal and cruel and frequently leads to quarrels andaccidents. Last year a boy had his leg broken in a race ofthis kind and frequently more or less serious accidentsOccur.This race was prohibited for two years during theadministration of GOV. Wm. Paisano.The various dances in which the Indians indulgehave but one objectionable feature namely: the length towhich they are carried.The individual as a rule dances fortoo long a period and exercises too little care after quittingthe dance,Frequently serious sickness results as a consequenceof exposure following the dance while the dancers are not.: andperspiring. The dance of itself, while orten termed pagan, 18in gratitude to some spirit, real or fancied, for the blessingsthey have received during the year and while this is frequently11ttle, it is gratifying to know they are thankful for samillavors.The dance to them 18 a solemn ceremony and on theoccasion of the Annual Harvest dance in Sept. each year, thepeople mingle in the spirit of friendship and good will andaltogetherit seems a pleasant and profitableday to them.
