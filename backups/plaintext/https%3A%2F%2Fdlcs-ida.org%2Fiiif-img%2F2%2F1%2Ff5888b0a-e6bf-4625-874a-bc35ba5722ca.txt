sidered, and suggestions as to improvement of conduet made. 01
Tenders were called upon to explain their conduot and were admon
ished to improve. The meetings were held twice a month. The
results have been good, In a measure the leaders have assumed
responsibility for the conduot of the members of their tribe.
The students became very much interested in the meetings and
the result has been an improvement in the care of property, in
the conduct of students and a desire of the members of each
tribe to maintain a high standard. Alto_ gether I believe the meet
ings have been worth the effort.
Generally speaking, the students have shown a satisfactory
interest in their academic and industrial work and the coopera
tion has been good.
During the year there were 54 desertions, and 33 were re
turned. A few pupils were expelled for objectionable con duct.
The students have attended the churcheso of their choice in
town. Catholic children have been instructed at the school on
Saturday afternoons and on Sundays in the forenoon, by the Sis
ters. The Protestant missionary has instructed all Protestant
children at the school on Saturdays in the afternoon and has
been in charge of the Y. M. C. A. for boys. Non- denominational
services have been conducted Sunday evenings at the school at
which the Priest and the Ministers took turns speaking to the
entire student body.
This service has been a great benefit to
the students. All of the ministers have shown a disposition to
cooperate. Good moral talks were given without exception and
none bordered on sectarianism.
