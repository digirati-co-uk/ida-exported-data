LAST WORDSI' ve been here since 7th grade to now, 12th grade. After graduation, we won' t see each otheranymore and we won' t be friends, but we will be in each other' s hearts forever. I think theteachers are very nice and they teach very well. Now it' s time to say goodbye. I' ll miss thisplace forever. Congratulations class of 2011!SFISESFISDiegoBradleyAs I sit here in class, I think back, back to days when high school was a lot funnier. Not whenyou had to do stressful SHP work and the rest of the work. My high school days were the bestand worst days I ever had. But, I have to thank my bro' s who have been there with me throughit all. So, thanks to Derek, “ Tay ”, Valdo, Keenen N., and Colby DeVore. And, of course, Ihave to share my love with all the lady friends, Jessica Tsosie, Nicolette, Angel, and all theother women in my life. In the end, I just want to share the love and thanks to everybody I methere at SFIS. For all the seniors, I just want to say we are all ready for the world. So we needto rise above the speculations without hesitation. I' m talking to you who' s reading this. I' mtrying to instill inspiration. So PEACE everybody.SFISChadBrownWow I' m finally here: just a few last months of high school. Thanks to my family for helpingme through everything, I love you all.
