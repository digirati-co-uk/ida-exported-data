I had two levels this year, the G and H.
the G and H. Each came one
half day to me. The balance of their time was spent in art
music, domestio science, and semi- craftsman classes. It would
have heen much better to have had only one class the entire
day. A half day with children of this level is too short a
tine to cover all of the needed work.
A great deal of my teaching this year was carried on
in an informal manner. I made a definite experiment in trying
to get these children to think for themselves. They, as a
tribe, seem to be inclined to let someone else think for them.
Wherever and whenever possible I gave them problems related
to their own lives to think over and solve. I really think
there was some improvement. How much, I hesitate to say.
