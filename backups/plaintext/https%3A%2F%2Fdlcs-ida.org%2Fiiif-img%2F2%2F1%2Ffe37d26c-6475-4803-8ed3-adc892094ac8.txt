Keeping a daily news notebook until such time as itbecame tire someI had two levels this year, the G and H.the G and H. Each came onehalf day to me. The balance of their time was spent in artmusic, domestio science, and semi- craftsman classes. It wouldhave heen much better to have had only one class the entireday. A half day with children of this level is too short atine to cover all of the needed work.A great deal of my teaching this year was carried onin an informal manner. I made a definite experiment in tryingto get these children to think for themselves. They, as atribe, seem to be inclined to let someone else think for them.Wherever and whenever possible I gave them problems relatedto their own lives to think over and solve. I really thinkthere was some improvement. How much, I hesitate to say.
