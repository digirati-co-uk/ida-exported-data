Section I..... Continued........ Law and Orderinduce the younger men to purchase liquor. Both state and federalofficials have shown themselves willing to cooperate with the schoolauthorities in the supression of the traffic.Pupils of the school make no beverages.It might help to have the disciplinarian and physical directordeputized as special officers.The writer does not know whether or not the use of peyote ormescal is on the increase among reservation Indians and knows verylittle regarding the traffic in these.There is no gambling among pupils of the school.Indian Dances.The dances indulged in by Indians of this section of the countryare generally harmless and are more in the nature of fiestas or celebrations participated in periodically.It is my opinion that theauthorities should ignore the dances unless there are times when somevulgarities are indulged in.At the time of the dances it is well toguard against the sale of intoxicants to the Indians.School children, when they are at home, always view and sometimes participate in the dances. The pueblos do not neglect theircrops or stock to attend dances. Parents residing near boardingschools often request that their children be permitted to go home toattend fiestas and dances, especially when the ceremonies occur onSaturday or Sunday.
