The expenditure of funds during the past year for the schools was approxi
mately the same as for the previous year. The expendi tures for 1925 being
approximately$ 189,787.70, and for 1926 being$ 191,337.00. During the present
year the power house at both the Navajo and Chin Lee Schools were completely
remodeled, putting them in good condition and installing electric lights at
the Chin Lee School.
The various schools have a complete outfit of playground apparatus, and
the children use them at all times. A period is set aside for supervised
playground activities, where the children are under the direction of a com
petent employee who di rects their plg. This includes both the boys and the
girls.
Schools on this reservation will be needed for a great many years on
account of the fact that we are practically just beginning to educate the
Navajo people. Public schools can not be supported on the reservation on
account of the fact that no taxes are collected from the Indians and the
State and County cannot support public schools.
