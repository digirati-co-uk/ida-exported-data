- 18PO P U L A T I O N1. The only organization of any sort among the Zunis is thatof the officers of the pueblo. This consists of a governor,lieutenant- governor, and five tenientes who are approved bythe caciquies or high priests for 11fe, or good behavior.These officers are helpful at times and at other times arequite a bit of a nuisance. They assist in maintaining lawand order and handle land matters upon the reservation.The fact that the way the land is divided is so unsatisfactory is in large part due to the manner in which this ishandled. They come to this office for assistance when theIndians refuse to pay attention to their orders and if it isthought they are not unreasonable,, their authority is upheld.The fact of the matter is the office is more of a help tothe pueblo officials than they are to us. However, as the seofficers are considered a part of the old usages and customsthere is no reason for interfering with them and when theycan be used advantageously we avail ourselves of their assistance.2.These Indians have no tribal funds to their credit and noannuities.LITOUG.
