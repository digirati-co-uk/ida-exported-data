Annual Report, 1911.
On the Santa Clara Indian Rosorve there is con
siderable standing timber of commeroial value. Authority
has been granted for the sale of such timber as should be
marketed, and the Indians use the doad and down timber
for fuel and fenoe posts, etc., but none is removed from
the Roserve for sale by the Indians, which could be done by
payment of the amount fixed by the Dopartment thorofor.
This is the only body of timber on the two Indian
Reservations
under my jurisdiction
, and at the present time
it is not readily accessible, and has not been disturbed to
any extent.
The Farmer, Forest Guard and two Policemen
are stationed in or near the body of timber to prevent and
put out fires, prevent trespass, and do co- operative
work with the Forest Service rangers.
