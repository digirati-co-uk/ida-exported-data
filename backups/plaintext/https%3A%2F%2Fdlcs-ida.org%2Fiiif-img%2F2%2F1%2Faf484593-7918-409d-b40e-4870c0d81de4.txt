SOFAR!Raymond AquilarSanto DomingoDarlene Ano: llaLagunaESome say that your Senior year is thebest! Most are inclined to agree, but then youfind out that it is also very challenging.Applications for scholarships, financial aid,college visits, ACT and SAT scores, grades,homework, studying, sports, class rings, announcements, nagging parents, and for afew, an afterschool job. All this hardlyleaves room for a social life. You also have tokeep in mind that eating and sleeping docome into the picture. At times a mere 24hours doesn' t seem enough, and at times itisn' t enough. All you have to do is take it alittle at a time. Now isn' t the time to" kickback," relax( maybe). Remember, itwill all seem like a" piece of cake" later, butfor now just remember graduating comesfirst. Then before you know it, the day ishere... the best day of your life!
