# 2The only stream crossing the Reservation is the LittleColorado River which enters the territory in Range 14 and movesdiagonally across the jurisdiction in a Northwesterly direction,finally terminating in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado Riverabout fifty miles distant.This stream flows approximately ninemonths out of each year, the remainder of the time being dried upfor lack of rainfall. There is a scant growth of cottonwood andbox- elder along its course. The remainder of the Reservation,however, is practically devoid of timber except portions of the NorthEast corner which grows some cedar.In addition, on the Leupp Jurisdiction proper there is aconsiderable area lying West of the Little Colorado and Northwestof the Agency which appears to be in the nature of public domaininsofar as the even numbered sections are concerned and the oddnumbered sections being owned either by the railroad company or byprivate interests. Several allotments have been made to the Indianswho look to the Leupp Jurisdiction for supervision.This areaapparently is not connected with any reservation for administrativepurposes and at the present time is administered both by the Leuppand Western Navajo Jurisdictions. In view of the fact that thisterritory is occuped by some fifty families and the further factthat their chiadren attend the Leupp School, it is recommended thatsteps be taken to annex this territory to the Leupp Jurisdictionfor administrative purposes. If possible Executive Order or Congressional action should be obtained definitely adjoining this territory tothe Leupp Jurisdiction.
