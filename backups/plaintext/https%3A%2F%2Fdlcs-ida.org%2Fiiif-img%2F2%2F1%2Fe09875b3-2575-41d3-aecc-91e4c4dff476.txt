The school is equipped to give the full course in the Academio Depart
men t and in addition to the Pre vocational instruction required, gives
Vocational courses in Home Economics, for girls, and in Carpentry, Black
smithing, and Agriculture, for boys. The instruction in the vocational

Teacher
in the positions of teacher of Agriculture, Domestic Science, and Farmer,
for a large portion of the year. It is to be hoped that the last- named
vacancy in these positions, that of Farmer, can be permanently filled by
an efficient appointment, before the re- opening of school. It is also
to be hoped that an efficient disciplinarian can be furnished the school

us to enlarge our farming and stock raising operations, and to raise a
larger portion of forage for stock, and vegetables for pupils, 60 acres
of land have been added to the school farm at a cost of$ 11903. Options
on this land were accepted March 1st, and we immediately took possession
of same, but it was too late to prepare the entire acreage for cultivation
