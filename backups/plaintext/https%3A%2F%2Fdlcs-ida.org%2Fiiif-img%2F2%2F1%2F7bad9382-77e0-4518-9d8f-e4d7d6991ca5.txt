And we will fill it with real India
youth and
for
rther we will fill it without drawing upon children
who would, were this school not hur., be in some paster school.
I a most thoroughly in sympathy with the eastern schools and
rejoice to see them grow in numbers and officiency. But there
are Indian children almost without number in the vicinity of this
school who will never under any circumstances go far away to
school, so while maintaining most perfect loyalty to my friends
in the gastern schools and pledging myself to use every influence
to persuade any and all of these Indian youth to take advantage
of the grand opportunities offered by these schools, I most
earnestly and respectfully urge that those children who cannot or
will not be persuaded to go east be given a chance here anong
the rountains of New Mexico to got as broad, comprehensice and
ww
useful, education as( aside frora the environment of a cultured
civilization) they can get in any of our great contemporaries.
Again I reiterate, give us the equipment and we will get the
pup..ls.
Thanking you for the promp 3 and favorable responses that
my requests and recommendations have met At you hands
I am very resp ctfully
