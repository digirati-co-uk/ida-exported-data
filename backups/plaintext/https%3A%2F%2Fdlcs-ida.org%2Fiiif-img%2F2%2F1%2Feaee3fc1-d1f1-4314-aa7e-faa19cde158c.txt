0April 4,We spent a great deal of time this morning working onthe hides. We tried using another method of tanning to seei≈ø the skins would come out better. We used sulphuricacidand salt.,This seems to work better, but I had not used itin the first place, because I was afraid to have it aroundwhere there were children.I put most of it on the skinsmyself or watched them very closely when they were doing it.We put neatsfootoil on some of the skins to softenthem more after they had been stretchedand pulled. Thenwe put them in a tub with sawdust, and some of the boystramped on them. A few of the skins are almost ready to beused. The childrenare anxious to put them on the floor.They say that this takes too long, that Navajo way just takesa little while. Of course the skins they fixed were notsoft when they had finished.Three of the boys took the horse and cart, and wentafter some good clay. We would like to plaster the inside wall, and fix the floor over.April 5,We hung the skins up to dry, that had been taken outof the tanning solution. The other skins we continuedtotry to soften by scraping, placing them in sawdust, andtramping on them.Then we beat and combed the hair side.This afternoonthe boys plasteredthe floor overwith clay. We tried to get it very smooth with the trowels.We also raked and cleanedthe yard.
