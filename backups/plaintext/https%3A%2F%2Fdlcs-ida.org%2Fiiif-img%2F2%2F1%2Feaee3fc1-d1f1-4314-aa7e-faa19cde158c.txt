April 4,
We spent a great deal of time this morning working on
the hides. We tried using another method of tanning to see
i≈ø the skins would come out better. We used sulphuric
acid
and salt.
,
This seems to work better, but I had not used it
in the first place, because I was afraid to have it around
where there were children.
I put most of it on the skins
myself or watched them very closely when they were doing it.
We put neatsfoot
oil on some of the skins to soften
them more after they had been stretched
and pulled. Then
we put them in a tub with sawdust, and some of the boys
tramped on them. A few of the skins are almost ready to be
used. The children
are anxious to put them on the floor.
They say that this takes too long, that Navajo way just takes
a little while. Of course the skins they fixed were not
soft when they had finished.
Three of the boys took the horse and cart, and went
after some good clay. We would like to plaster the in
side wall, and fix the floor over.

We hung the skins up to dry, that had been taken out
of the tanning solution. The other skins we continued
to
try to soften by scraping, placing them in sawdust, and
tramping on them.
Then we beat and combed the hair side.
This afternoon
the boys plastered
the floor over
with clay. We tried to get it very smooth with the trowels.
We also raked and cleaned
the yard.
