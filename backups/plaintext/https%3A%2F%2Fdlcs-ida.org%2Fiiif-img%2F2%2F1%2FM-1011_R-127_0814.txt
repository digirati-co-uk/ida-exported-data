There have beenno deaths from disease. Neither have any pupils been sent homeor away to die. Two pupils developed tubercular symptoms, butboth seem to have a good chance for recoveryNew Mexico has had its usual gristof contagious diseases this year, but we have suffered but little at the schoolAn occasional case of measles, or mumps perhaps; and some whooping- cough. In March, we had a very considerable number ofcases of influenza, something like a dozen of which developedinto pneumonia. But in every case, the attack was mild andthe patient soon recoveredNo additional facilities are needed to obtain properand adequate care of the sick, excepting that we ought to havesome operating instruments and a little equipment in additionto what we now have. This matter will work out in the course ofa little time. We have a hospital, rather antiquated type. However, it serves right well and there are no influences whichoperate to prevent its meximum usefulnessAll in all, the year has been an easy one from thestandpoint of health conditions Aside from the influenzaflare- up of March, which, as above noted, did not amount to nearlyso much as the 1918 attack, there was but little to cause anyConcern.The presert corps of employees is sufficient to takecare of the heal th conditions at this school,
