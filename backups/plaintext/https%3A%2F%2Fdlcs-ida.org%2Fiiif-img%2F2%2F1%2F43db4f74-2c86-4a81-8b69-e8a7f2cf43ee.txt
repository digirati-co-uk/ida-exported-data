PUEBLO AGENCY
and
ALBUQUERQUE SCHOOL.
( Sanchez, Agent.) April 27, 1885.
There are 19 pueblos with a population of 8, 145, or only
27 Indians less than the census of 1805.
Some have increased in
population, some decreased.
Zuni and Laguna have made the largest
gains.
Nambe and pojoaque have lost the most, the Pojoaques num
bering only 18.
Their buildings are almost in a state of ruin.
Pueblo of Santa Clara is filthy and dirty, but the Indians are
industrious, have extensive fields and considerable stock.
This
Pueblo has a day school, 3 boys and 4 girls.
They promised to
have more children attend school.
Cost of maintaining the school
is greater than the work justifies.
Pueblo of San Juan has popu
lation of 359, is clean and neat.
Indians are progressive, but
otake no interest in educating their children.
53 children are
enrolled, with an average attendance of 5.
They refuse to send
their children to a Protestant.
School had better be discontinued.
Pueblo of Iselita has population of 1,087.
The Indians are
industrious and some have stock and other property from$ 8,000. to
$ 30,000., are prosperous and advancing.
The school is neglected
and improperly managed.
Neither of the teachers have done their
noorde
duty.
Recommends that Matron's pay cease April 17, and if the
be suspusht
teacher does not attend to his work, his services be dispensed with
on June 30th.
A radical change will have to come over the express
ed feelings of this teacher before he will take such interest in
this day school, as would be expected from a school employe.
Albuquerque School, 159 pupils. Children well dressed and clean.
