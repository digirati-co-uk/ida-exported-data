Albuquerque School, 1915.( 11)Section III-------- School.( concluded)felt need. The building is about half completed and will be a splendidstructure. The carpenter labor and painting is being performed by twoirregular carpenters and the school boys. The other construction 18being done under contracts.During the current fiscal year it has been necessary to use dormi.tory space for one classroom and shop space for another. The old assembly hall will be converted into two classrooms and a book room andwill provide sufficient classrooms without the necessity of using dormitory and shop space in the future.In this section of the country, there are in the neighborhood of6, 000 Navajo children without school facilities, and it will be a greatmany years before these and other Indians become sufficiently educatedand advanced to look after their own affairs and to maintain schools.If the Pueblo land were allotted in severalty, district schools mightbe provided for them, but it it until this is done, public schoolswill not be established near enough to their villages for their children to attend. I am of the opinion that government schools in Arizonaand New Mexico should be maintained for periods ranging from 25 to 50seveyears.
