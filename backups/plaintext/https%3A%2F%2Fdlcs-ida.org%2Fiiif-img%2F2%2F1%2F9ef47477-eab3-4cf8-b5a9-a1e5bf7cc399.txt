( 21)Section III. SCHOOLS:Acting under the general supervision of the Superintendent, theDay School Inspector supervises and directs the work of thirteenday schools located on seven of ten Pueblos. Threo of the Pueblos,Sia, Santa Ana and Sandia, have no schools.There was a small schoolon the Sia Pueblo, but for many reasons this was closed last year.The Sia children can be better arranged for at the Santa Fe IndianBoarding School, and thus save the extraordinary expense of a verysmall day school.There is no need for a school at Sandia Pueblo,as the small number of children attend the Albuquerque IndianBoarding School. There should be a day school at Santa Ana.The site has been acquired, and during the last several years thematter has had Indian Office consideration, but has not been providedfor by an appropriation.The last census shows there are 1940 children of school age.This school population is cared for as shown on the following sheet.
