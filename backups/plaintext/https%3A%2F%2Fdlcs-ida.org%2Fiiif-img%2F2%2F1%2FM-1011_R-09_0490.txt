IThe school plant consists of frame buildings painted white.Most of the buildings are in a good state of repair. The kitchenand dining room are in an old building and are not in keeping withthe rest of the school plant. It is not practical to remodel thekitchen ana a ining room in the old building in which they are located, so as to make them much better than they are. A new ki tchen and dining room is very much needed. The main building, whichis one of the oldest buildings at the school, and which was formerly used as dormitories for the pupils, can be repaired at comparatively small expense and made into very nice employees' quarters,with employees' mess, sitting rooms, etc.The domestic water supply should be improved by providing afiltering and storage tank where the water is taken out of thestream in the canyon a few miles above the school. At present whenthe water in the stream is muddy by reason of melting snows and rainsin the mountains it reaches the buildings in the same condition, asit is taken into the water main from a little diversion tank builtat the side of the stream.The employees on the whole have been efficient and loyal, andhave worked together harmoniously.The sentiment of the Community is against the intermingling ofthe races.The total expenditures for the support of the school during thecurrent fiscal year were$ 15, 750 greater than for the previous year.This was due to an increased attendance ma de possible by increasingthe capacity of the school by fifty pupils.The abnormally high cost of nearly all articles make it increasingly difficult to run this school. It is hoped that Congresswill make some provision for a more liberal appropriation in orderto do more efficient school work. It may not be possible to getthrough the fiscal year 1921 with the present appropriation.The school is not well equipped with play ground apparatus, butthe children make good use of such apparatus as there is here.Until the public schools of the state are willing to take inthe Indian children and are ready to make arrangements for educatingthe Indian pupils on reservations, it would probably be unwise todiscontinue the boarding school he re.The enrollment at this school during the fiscal year 1920 was313 with an average attendance of 341.3
