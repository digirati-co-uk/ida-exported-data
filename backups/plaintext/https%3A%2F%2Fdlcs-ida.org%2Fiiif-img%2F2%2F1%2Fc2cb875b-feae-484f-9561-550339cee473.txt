COUPLES ON
CAMPUS
Students here at Santa Fe Indian
School fell in love left and
right. They depended on their
" Main Squeezes" to help them
on cloudy days and get them
through difficult times. These
couples were more then just
boyfriend/ girlfriend types; they
were much closer and con
nected because most of them
lived on campus. Day students
had a tougher time maintaining
their relationships because they
saw each other only during
school, which is why they were
often tardy for their classes.
