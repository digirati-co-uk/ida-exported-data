Dext' Madam
I have just learned that in some of the Pueblos, there is
an impression that no more pupils will be received at this school, but
this is a mistake, and I wish you would kindly inform the Indians of
your Pueblo that I will receive as many children from San Ildefonso
as are brought here,
the traveling expense runds, however, are entirely exhausted, 80 it
will be impossible for me to pay anything for their transportation,
We now have over 300 pupils, but I can easily take care or a few
more, and if there are any from your Pueblo who desire to come, I think

Atteita
Superintendent.

If any pupils wish to come, I will send our conveyence for them
