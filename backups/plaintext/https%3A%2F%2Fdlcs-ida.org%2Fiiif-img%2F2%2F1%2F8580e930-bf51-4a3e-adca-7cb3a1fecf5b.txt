1. The plan for the advancement of the Indian
along Industrial lines is based upon the faot tbet fully
ninety- five percent of the Indians of this Agenoy will
eventually make their living from agriculture and live
stock and a persistent endeavor to effect improvement
along these lines is being made, The help of the non

the pupils from this Jurisdiotion, was enlisted in this
effort wbioh now, aooording to the new Course of Study,

2. There is no sohool or Agenoy farm, which is
to be regretted, for if one were available it could be
used for experimental purposes to determine the best
breed of cattle and sheep for these Indians and the
seeds
testing of new and beneficial
tos, cereals and gra88e8.
( a) Improvement
is slow in all the Pueblos except
Laguna
This is owing to the opposition to any innovation
