industrial departments of the school during the past
year over that of former years
The total expenditures for all purposes during
the current fiscal year were practically the same as
for the preceding year, the appropriations for the
support of the school being the same for both years.
More playground apparatus was provided during
the year and good use is made of all
In my opinion it will be necessary to continue
government schools among the Pueblo Indians for a num
ber of years, as they are not willing yet to break away
from village life, and build their homes on allotments,

orchard and field crops About 60 tons of root vegetables
and cabbages were raised and stored away for winter,
but as this was more than could be used on the pupils'
tables, a considerable quantity was fed to the school stock
The garden is a model in almost every respect
