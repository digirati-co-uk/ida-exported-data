C.Sir:In a recent lengthy report on the Navajo reservationdated March 28, 1928, the importance of the development andconservation of available water with practical, purposefulrange control correlated with good breeding practice wasespecially emphasized.Over a million dollars has been expended in construction,operation and maintenance of irrigation projects, varying inarea from a few acres to two thousand acres, production fromwhich contributes very considerably to family subsistence andin small measure supplementing range feed for their better11vestock. A half million dollars has been expended for welland spring development to insure better range use and the necessity for a more equitable distribution of stock water isrecognized by Congressional appropriation of$ 100, 000. 00 forthe work in the next fiscal year. Recovery and conservationof available water is inexpensively met in the proper dovelopment of springs and soaps and in the construction of smallearth tanks in carefully selected sites and soils. An earthtank one hundred feet in diameter and six feet in depth filledwith water could supply a thousand sheep for four or fivemonths, allowing fifty percent for loss through seepage andevaporation, which must be reckoned for open tanks in desertcountries. Springs of one and two gallon flow per minutecould supply stock water for a township of range of carryingcapacity common to the six hundred townships of Navajo domain,Proper and equitable development of all available water willingure better distribution of grasing, more even utilizationof range growth, and in consequenco, better return on the stockindustry.Livestock production, and particularly shoep, is the primary interest of the Navajo and its muccess is ninety- nine percont dependent on the natural range growth. Such dependabilitycalls for yoarlong grasing and in 20 section of the countryand among no other people is the problon of intelligent andconservative use of range forage so acute. The stability of
