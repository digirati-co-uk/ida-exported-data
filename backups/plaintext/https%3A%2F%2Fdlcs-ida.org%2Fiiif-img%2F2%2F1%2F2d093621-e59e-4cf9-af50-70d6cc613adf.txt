Zuni PrayerSHNII have sent forth my prayers.HOMEOur children.Even those who have erected their sheltersAt the edge of the wilderness,May their roads come in safely,May the forestsAnd the brushStretch out their water- filled armsTo shield their hearts;May their roads come in safely;May their roads all be fulfilled,May it not somehow become difficult for themWhen they have gone but a little way.ONCIMMay all the young boys,All the young girls,And those whose roads are ahead,May they have powerful hearts,Strong spirits;On roads that reach to Dawn LakeMay they grow old.AnonymousMother EarthElizabeth and Debbie Reese... continuinglifes unendingcycle.Mother Earthtaught us torespect, loveand live inharmony.
