Making Moccasin ShoesBy JAMES ACO ANALLOLagunaLong ago, before the white man discovered this country, there were no shoefactories as there are now, so the Indians made their own shoes.The first step in moccasins is the tanning of a piece of cow hide. This is thenburied in damp soil over night so as to make it pliable and soft. This piece isused for the soles.The size of the moccasins is taken by measuring the feet. This is done byplacing the foot on the piece of hide which is marked. This insures a correct fit.The soles are then cut out where they are marked.The uppers, the tongue and the sides, are of buckskin and are cut as high asthe person wishes, usually about four inches above the ankles. The uppers aremeasured and cut in the same manner as the soles.Now the pieces are ready to sew together. In sewing the pieces together, avery strong cord is used. The cord is made of sinews twisted into one strong cord.The tongue is first sewed on, and then the sides. This is done with an aw]to make holes so that the thread will slide through easily. The awl used in sewingis sharpened on rough stone.The Indians always like to wear colored moccasins, and red is the favoritecolor. The uppers of the moccasins are colored with herbs and roots which arepowdered and boiled until the liquid is dark red. The buckskin uppers are dippedinto this liquid when it has cooled. The moccasins are decorated with silver buttons. This is the way the Laguna Indians make their moccasins.
