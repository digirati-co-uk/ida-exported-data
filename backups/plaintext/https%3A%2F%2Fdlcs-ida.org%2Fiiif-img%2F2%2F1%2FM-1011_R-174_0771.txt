ANNUAL REPORT, 1927.
ZUNI AGENCY, NEW MEXICO.
NARRATIVE.
SECTION No. 5.-
ALLOTMENTS
.
No allotment work has ever been done on this reservation,
nor has any disposition been made of surplus lands.
Some allotments of the Zuni Indians have been made on public
domain and a number of the Navajo Indians, who are under this
Â· jurisdiction, has been so allotted. Because of the large amount
of railroad land in this section, there is very little of the
public domain in this section left open for settlement.
SECTION NO. 6.----- SALES.
As these Indians have never been alloted, they have no sales
of land, nor have any patents on the reservation been issued to
Indians or others as personal property is all that is held by these
Indians, settlement of estates tha simple matter and this is
handled by the officers of the tribe. None of the Zunis have
individual Indian money on deposit. Two Navajo scouts have a
small deposit here, which is held as a voluntary deposit and is
paid out as the needs of these Indians require.
