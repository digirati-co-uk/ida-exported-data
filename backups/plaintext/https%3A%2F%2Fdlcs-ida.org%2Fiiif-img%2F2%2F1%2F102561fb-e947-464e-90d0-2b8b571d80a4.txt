Pueblo Bonito School.
During the past year two briok dormitories with a capacity
each for 30 pupils was constructed, which gives us a complement
of( 6) of these dormitories. Five of these were used as quarters
for 156 pupils; the other one had to be taken for a hospital, as
no building has yet has been provided for the care of the sick. As
mentioned in last years report we are in need of a larger assembly
hall as the present assembly hall is entirely to small for the
purposes intended, as it now requires that this ball be sub- divided
into class rooms for use next year.
One shop building 35 x 60
has been provided to take care of the carpenter and blacksmith shop
work, but is entirely to small since our increased enrollment,
and another building should be constructed of similar size and de
sign for the blacksmith shop and wagon repair department, leaving
the other shop for the carpenter, repair and manual training work.
This new building is especially urged and
proper equipment pro
vided that our boys may have complete training in these respective
departments. Inspecting officials have also favored this measure,
but as yet your Office has failed to approve the construction of
the proposed shop building.
The proposed assembly hall should be given consideration at an
early date, as we cannot get along without a more spacious building
for assembly, gymnasium and social purposes.
A tentative plan was
sent your office but at this time nothing definite has been learned
there to.
