Timber is on grantsand purchases belonging to the Laguna and Isle ta Indians. Thetimber belonging to the Isleta Indians is ripe and when opportunity offers should be sold as stumpage. Of course the Indiansown the land in fee simple and they can make sales without authotity from the Government, but it is believed the Superintendentcan direct such sales at the proper time and assist them in securing what their timber is worth. The timber is in a hillycountry a long distance from saw mills and logging operationscould not be carried on by the Indians but would have to be bythe purchasingcompany. At present there is no particular matketfor this timber excepting in a sma 11 way by men who ope rate verysmall mills, but within a few years the American Iumber Company,whose mills are in the city of Albuquerque, will be looking foradditional timber and will then pay satisfaotoryprices for thetimber owned by the Isleta Indians. It would be to the advantageof the Indians to wait until this company needs their timber.There has been no damage from fires in any of the timber belongingto the Indiansbut the timber area ownedby theIsleta Ind ians is visitedby campersmorethan that ownedby
