O-2HISTORY OF DEVELOPMICNT.Coincident with the interest shown by the differentoperating companies in the Rocky Mountain Region during thepast three or four years, came the discovery by severalprominent geologists, of well defined structures located insouthwestern Colorado, southeastern Utah, northeasternArizona and northwestern New Mexico, This area, commonlyreferred to as the" Four Corner Areal of the southwest,had seen very little drilling prior to 1921, outside of thesmall shallow development in the San Juan field of southeasternUtah.In March 1921 the major companies operatingin the RockyMountain states evidenced a desire to prospect for oil withinthe area described and the Midwest Oil Company began drillingon what is known as the McElmo structure, in the extremesouthwest corner of Colorado. This well is located 12 miles,practically due west of Cortez, Colorado, and was a bandonedas dry at a depth of 4588, after encountering 6 barrels of 67gravity oil at 1888 feet and 4,000,000 cu. ft. of gas between4190 and 4217.In July of the same year the Midwest Refining Co. and theProducers and Refiners Corporation drilled three wells on whatis known as the Southern Ute Dome, approximately 14 milesnorth of Farmington, New Mexico, and 5 miles south of theColorado-- New Mexico line. All of these wells secured goodgas flows, estimated at from 4,000,000 to 36,000,000 cu. ft.of dr√Ω gas at a depth of approximately 2400 ft.Following the discovery of gas in these wells, a considerable increase in interest was shown this locality, with theresult that between the summer of 1921 and the fall of 1923the entire Four Corner area had been combed over by geologistsin search for suitable structures for testing. Considerablework was done by the Midwest Refining Company and others overthe State of New Mexico and several structures east of Gallupwere located, in addition to those on the Navajo reservation.The Hogback structure, 10 miles southeast of Shiprock, waslocated by the Midwest Refining Co. and application made tothe Department of the Interior and the Indian Office for alease on a ppr oximately 4800 acres covering the apex of the dome.At that time leases could be granted by the Navajo Indiansin council assembled, with the approval of the Secretary ofThe Interior and Office of Indian Affairs in Washington. Sucha lease was entered into on August 15th, 1921, and we. Sapproved in Washington November 4th, 1921.
