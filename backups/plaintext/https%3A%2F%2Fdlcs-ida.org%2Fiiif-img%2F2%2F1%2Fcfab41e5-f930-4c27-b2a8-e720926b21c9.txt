11calculationsat all. We do not come in contact with the liquorquestion at all,It liquor did appear here, the local authorities wouldjoin cordially with us in putting down the traffic.The Indians here make no liquor of any kind.These Indians are inveterate Gamblers. men and womenamong themselves! I have never known of the Utes gambling withWhite people- even off the Reserve- except possibly on horse races.These Utes gamble with cards, with sticks( a heathen device) and onhorse races. The gambling on horse races is the least of it all.I have made no effort to stop gambling. It would be useless. When they get busy with other things they will stop gambling.The tribe loses nothing. The money circulates among them.It will require years to convince them it is wrong.With them it is not wrong. It is only a legitimate amusement. Noneof them suffer in consequence. It is not as practiced by them, a vice,
