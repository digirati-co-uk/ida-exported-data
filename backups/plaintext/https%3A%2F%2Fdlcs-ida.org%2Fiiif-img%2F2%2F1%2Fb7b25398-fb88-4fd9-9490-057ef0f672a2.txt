They have 3 farm wagons, 1 spring wagon, and 1 buckboard,
the farm wagons and the buckboard are in good condition, the spring
wagon is badly worn, it is of not much value.
The fire protection amounts to but little, it consists of
pails filled with water in the buildings, and outside of the ware
house and some of the other buildings barrels with water are kept;
should a fire occur in any building, it would without doubt burn,
Water for domestic use is drawn in barrels from a small
spring about two miles from the agency buildings.
There have been several buildings built at this sub- agen
cy since my last inspection. The three new cottages that have been
built for employees are not suitable for this cold climate, they are
cheaply constructed frame one story buildings, they are very hot in
summer, and very cold in winter. The most useful buildings in this
country, are those made of adobe brick, they can be built for less
cost than a frame or brick building.
A new dwelling should be erected for the agent, and ano
ther cottage for employees. The warehouse is not large enough to
store the agency supplies, a new warehouse or an addition to the pres
ent warehouse should be built.
The buildings and their condition is as follows:
Temporary office.
A poor, old, small one story frame in bad repair, it is now
used as Police quarters.
Black smith shop.
A small one story frame in good repair.
Carpenter and Blacksmith shop.
