33- Hopidistrict- for Park- to- Park Highways connecting Mesa Verde Park,Bryce Canyon, Cedar Brakes, Zion Park, the North Rim Grand Canyon,Lee's Ferry Bridge, Navajo Mountain, Monument Valley, Canyon deChelly, Grand Canyon Park, and the Northern Navajo, Southern Navajo,Western Navajo and Hopi Indian Reservation, as suggested andrequested by the National Park Service. Such a system would helpthese reservations and Indians very much.We badly need additional employees: Three stockanen withquarters; four school assistants to relieve students of routinework, two teachers for the boarding school, one for Toreve Day School,one for Chinopovy Day School, one for Hotevilla Day School; onefirst- class stenographer, experienced and capable of handling anyoffice work, but especially to take stenographic work, look after thecensus, vital statistics and handle the office files, so that thesuperintendent may get out into the field where he belongs. Ouroffice work is always behind; the superintendent being compelled toremain in the office more than half his time doing clerical work-work that such an efficient helper could properly attend to withbetter results and satisfaction to the Indians and the Indian Office.This matter of the superintendent not getting out into the fieldmore was brought up by the Hopis at Oraibi when the Trazier SubCormittee held a hela a hearing at Oraibi.Stores operated and owned by Indians should be limitedto the number necessary and regulated under the same regulationsgoverning white- licensed traders' stores on the reservation. wehave too many, and natives now take advantage of present conditions,handling live stock in and out of seasons as they wish and puttingup stores here and there without permission or permits.We urge the office to build another plant about likethe Keans Canyon school plant, at another place on the reservation,for the large number of Navajo school children now out of school,and to do it this coming year if possible. This is a very importantneed, and until it is done the Government will be criticised andunable to give the Navajos the education necessary to make forproper progress toward citizenship and independent self- support.E.
