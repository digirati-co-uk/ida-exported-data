Love Like Winter by. Angel B
The snow is cold just like your heart,
The white in your eyes is the frost on my dark life,
Thinking of our love like December;
Dead and cold,
Never will i find that warm love on a cold day like snow
falling
,
Will the icicles around your heart ever melt?
When will we finally have that warm and cozy love?
maybe in the spring our love will blossom again like it used
to,
Well I guess I just have to wait then won' t I!
A Letter to Kid from Jelly by. Jamie Toledo
Dear Kid,
I' m sorry for going all over the place, including your face
and hands, but it was all Peanut Butter' s fault. He made me
do it and he wanted you to get mad and eat us so he
wouldn' t have to see the world anymore. But he will see it
again very soon, if you know what I mean. So now I' m writ
ing this letter to you in the dark, in your stomach, with ev
erything else your ate.
