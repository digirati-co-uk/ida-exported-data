- 12-higher grados should be added until we are ablo to carry our childrenat loast through junior high school. Wo are short four class roomsat the Shiprock school and the auditorium is entirely too small forour needs. I feel that we should build a new school building whichwill house sixtoon class rooms, an audi torium which wll accommodat.eight hundred poople, and a gymnasium. This should be in connectionwith the program for increasing the capacity of this school.A boarding school to accommodate thro. hundred pupilsshould be built near Farmington. With this additional capacitywe shall be able to take care of all childron on the reservation notprovided for last year.Respectfully submitted,E ambayE. R.
