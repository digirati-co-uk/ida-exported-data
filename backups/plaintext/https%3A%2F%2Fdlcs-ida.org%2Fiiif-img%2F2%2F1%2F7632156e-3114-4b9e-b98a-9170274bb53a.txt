Juniors take
Leadership
Junior year is when students are
most likely eligible for National
Honor Society. Marce Povijua and
Nate Riley are new inductees and
very proud to be apart of this
society. Each member was
nominated considering the
student' s academic excellence and
the potential each student has
shown. Good behavior was also
another factor that each student had
to carry because each NHS member
is a role model.
