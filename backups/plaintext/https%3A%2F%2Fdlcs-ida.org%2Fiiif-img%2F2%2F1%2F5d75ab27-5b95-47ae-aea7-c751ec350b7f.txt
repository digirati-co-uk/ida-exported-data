If it were not for the Indian School here there are over
2000 Indian chi l√•ren who would never see the inside of a school house.
The state authorities in most cases do not enforce school attendance
upon Indians. Also the families roam about considerably and do not
stay in any one place long enough to allow their children to attend
school. Most of the families prefer to have their children attend
the Government school so that the dhildren can pursue their studies
and the parents can continue to make their living among lumber camps,
fi shing, or berry- picking, etc., without dragging their children
along with them. Of course, the school is small for the number eligi
ble to attend it, and many prospective pupils have to be refused ad
mission; but many receive much benefit. Considering the attitude of
the State and County authorities toward attendance of Indians and con
sidering the number of eligible Indian children in Michigan I am of
the opinon that the School should conti mue in operation for a number
of years yet, possibly, fifteen or twenty years at least. To abolish
the school would be a calamity to the Indians of Michigan, Many
Would grow up without any schooling whatever under present existing
conditions.
