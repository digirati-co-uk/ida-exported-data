ainual ReportCar son Indian Agency1925For many years there were a number ofsquatters or settiers on lends within the PyramidLake Reservation. These ranchers had lived onthese lands some as long as forty years, or more,and had paid nothing to the state in taxes or tothe Indians for the use of the land.The last Congress passed a bill authorizing the people holding these lands to pay theappraised value of the lands and obtain deeds.The proceeds will be used for the benefit of thePyramid Lake Indians.While many of the squatters objectedto the value placed on the lands and attemptedto have the provision of the bill changed, itis believed that most of them are complyingwith the terms of the bill and will pay theappraised value of their holdings.Fort McDermitt ReservationThis is an isolated reservation onthe Nevada- Oregon line, about 35 miles northof Winnemucca, the nearest railroad point.The Indians have only small patchesof lan√¢ irrigated and these are not as well caredfor as they should be. Many of them have small gardensand raise feed for a small number of cattle andhorses.Most of the able- bodied men on thisreservation go off in the spring to shear sheepfor the neighboring ranchers, for which they arewell paid, and in the summer they work in harveston the large cattle ranches in this part of thestate.Many of them are not provident enoughto lay up their earnings for the winter months,and consequently they are sometimes in hardfinancial straits, with scanty provisions.
