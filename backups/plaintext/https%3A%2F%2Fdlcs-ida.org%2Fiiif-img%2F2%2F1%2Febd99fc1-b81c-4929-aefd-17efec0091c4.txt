7.desirableand in the interests of the Indians I, at the same time, knowthat it would be very objectionableto the citizens of coconino county,and, having discussedthe matter with the leading citizens of said countyand obtained their consent to accept the Little Colorado River as thesouthern boundary line of the proposed extension, see Exhibit No. 22,transmittedherewith, I would respectfullyrecommend an extension of thereservationon a line due west from the southwest corner of the moquireservationto the Little colorado River, thence down the Little colorado to the eastern boundary line of the Grand Canor Forest Reserve, thencenorth on the boundary of the said Forest Reserve, to its northeast corner,thence west along the north boundary of said Forest Reserve to the colorado River, thence up the Colorado River to the Navajo Indian Reservation.This would add to the Navajo Reservation a tract of country of about40 x 50 miles, 1,280,000 acres, making the Little Colorado River thesouthern boundary, which river is considerable of a stream and would givea natural and well defined boundary which could be easily recognized bythe whites, and, as I am informed, the Little Colorado River was formerlythe dividing line between the Navajos and Apaches, and which was thusstrictly adhered to and respected by both tribes, the Navajos could therefore be brought to recognize and accept said stream along the extendedportion of the reservation as their boundary line, over which they shouldnot graze their herds.In conclusion I desire to add, that I have taken creat pains to inform myself regarding the proposed extension of the Navajo Reservation,as hereinset forth, which I trust will enable the Department to actunderstandinglyin the premises.I am, sir, very respectfully,Your obedientservant,Games InaughlinU.
