1{Circular No. 1604.July 1, 1926.HOPI INDIANAGENCYANNUAL REPORTNARRATIVESECTIONSection VI-- Sales.We have no patents in fee or certificates of competencyamong these people. None of this reservation has ever beensold. It is still intact as set aside by the president.During the past year we have had one patent in fee issuedfor mission land at Oraibi. This is the only patented land Iknow of on the reservation. I understand from the Indians thatthey do not want any lands patented without their consent.We have had no sales of inherited lands or surplus lands.We have had no sales of non- competent Indians' lands.The determination of heirs of deceased Indians, so far asI can find out, has never been attempted on this reservationand I question if it would ever be wise to start such a thingund er present conditions. This matter is taken care of accordingto tribal and Indian customs. We encourage and advise all Indiansto divide the property of deceased relatives according to statelaws and are making some progress in this work. For years pastthe strongest brother got everything he wanted to take.We have paid out very little individual Indian money;practically none, excepting for reimbursable payments, duringthe year.Respectfully submitted,Edgar K.
