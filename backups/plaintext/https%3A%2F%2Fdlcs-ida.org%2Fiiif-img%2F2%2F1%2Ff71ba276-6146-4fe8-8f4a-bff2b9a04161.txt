San Juan School& Agency
The completion of the farmers' stations, construction of
physicians' quarters and of the hospitals and tuberculosis
sanitariu, and the extension of the sewer system to take in
the agency growds are the most pressing needs in the way of
agency construction on the reservation at this time. During
the year the water system was extended to the agency grounds.
The present agency jail is a sall log and rough lum
ber building. It is entirely inadequate and very insanitary,
A concrete jail and police quarters should be built to take
its place
.
The new sawmill near Toadlena was completed during the
year.
It is expected that the timber within reasonable reach
of the mill will keep it running at least ten years. The
lumber from this mill will be used for new school and agency
buildings, for erection of permanent Indian homes, for con
struction of flumes, and to provide shelter for stock.
Two automobiles, four spring wagons, and a team of horses
were purchased during the year thereby maldng a marked im
provemont in transportation equipment. An addition automo
bile and a motor truck should be purchased during the coming
yoar.
