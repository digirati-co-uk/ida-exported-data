Part"
more than three months ago you promised to deliver the greater
part on the 300 tons called for in your contact without dulay, and I
neve since that me called upon you repeatedly to deliver coal, and
in only a few instances have you done so.
I meel that I have been extremely lenient in not reporting the
ago,
ter to the Indian Office some time, but I know if I did so, it would
no dous bar you from again receiving any contracts connected with the

Indian Services
Your failure to furnish coal had worked a severe hardship upon
the school,
We have no contract for wood this year, but are using
6 cords per day, which we are compelled to do oy reason of your failure
to carry out the specifications of your contract.
