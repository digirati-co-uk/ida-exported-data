The Broken ImageBy: Tasha NelsonI stare into the mirrorEmpty looks shine from my eyes;I study the picture.She smiles but she' s justa disguise.I' ve been painting a pure image of mefor so longThis image has become meand I' ve become dead,At least to society, demandingperfection.No one wants what' sunder the surfaceAnd I can' t make them see past thepretty face.However I will build up thecourage I' ve torn downTo justify what' s hidden in this costumeI' ve been wearing for some timeBecause I despise this affectionAnd I refuse to live as an illusion.I' ll break this image so I can beFree, unchained,liberated, at peace.89
