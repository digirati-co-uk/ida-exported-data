Page 13NARRATIVE.Annual report. 1915Section 1v-- Industries.The population of this reservation, exceeding 11, 200 aretenders of flocks and weavers of blankets. Their cattle, horsesand sheep range over portions of Arizona and New Mexico. Farmingis not an important factor without irrigation. The Navajos areadepts in growing corn without irrigation where a white man willutterly fail. This is done by an old method which has probablynot varied much with years. The Indians now raise considerablehay, etc., and this is all handled with up- to- date machinery.The past farming season was very favorable and crops wereexcellent, much corn and hay being raised. Their small farms areirrigated by flood waters of melting snow in the mountains. Thesepeople are progressive and intelligent. It is estimated from thetrade that passes through the trading stores on the reservationand at Gallup, New Mexico, that the Navajos derive$ 600, 000. 00annually from the sale of wool, blankets and hides. About as muchland is now under cultivation as can be without the constructionof extensive irrigation projects. The past year the Indians havetaken hold and now have under construction several irrigationprojects. These are being helped along by the farmers and alsoby issuing scrapers, plows, etc., for labor. Every Navajo isencouraged to fence up a small piece of ground for crops; to dobetter farming but as stated heretofore, without regular irrigationa Navajo will frequently raise an extensive crop where the ordinarysettler will utterly fail.
