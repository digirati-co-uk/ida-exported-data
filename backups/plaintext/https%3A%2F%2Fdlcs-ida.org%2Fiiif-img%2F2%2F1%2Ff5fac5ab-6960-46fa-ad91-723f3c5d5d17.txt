Health.
Pueblo Bonito.
The general health of the school and agency
was good, tho there has been much eye trouble
and skin eruption of pupils, the latter due perhaps
to the effects of continuous pinion nut eating.
Some tuberculosis prevails, the school is provided
with a small hospital which is used for both
reservation patients as well for the pupils. Efforts
have been mad for years to secure the construction
of a suitable hospital but to no avail. Every effort
is made to maintain a sanitary school plant with
special attention given thru inspection of buildings,
equipment and examination frequently of the children
themselves and such remedy applied as conditions seem
to necessitate.
