U.S. INDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL,
Santa Fe, N. Mo, July
29, 1892.
To the Hon. Cornmissioner of Indian Affairs,
Washington, D. C.
Sir:
I have the honor to report that in making the annual esti
mate for the present year, coal was omitted.
I desire authority
either to purchase in open market or to advertise for proposals.
The school will require 150 tons,
The market price is$ 5.50 per
ton in car load lots, and$ 6,00 in smaller lots.
If time is
taken to advertise for proposals, it will be necessary to pur
chase a few tons( not to exceed 10 tons) for immediate use.
I de
sire early instructions in the matter,
Very respectfully
Ale Aliast
Superintendent.
