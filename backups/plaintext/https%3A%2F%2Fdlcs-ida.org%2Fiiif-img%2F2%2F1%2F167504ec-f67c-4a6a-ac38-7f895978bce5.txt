Dear sir
For some time past the meat furnished on your contract
I have
by Mr Max Knodt of this city has not been satisfactory.
several times spoken to him about it and for a few days he would
qual
deliver fairly good meat and then drop back to the same poor
ity.
Yesterday he delivered a quarter of meat that was not fat
to eat, and again today he delivered a whole beef that was unfit.
I did not accept the game and have purchased in the open market.
Very respectfully

Superintendent.
