However, there is, of course, no chanceof showing this on appeal and the bosque iand is notof enough"importance or value to justify an appealThe Indians desire that an appeal be taken, And Iwas forced, by their insistence, to say that I wouldlay the matter before you for a ruling. This claim,however, is the only one of those lost on which therecould be any possible doubt as to the correctness ofthe result.
