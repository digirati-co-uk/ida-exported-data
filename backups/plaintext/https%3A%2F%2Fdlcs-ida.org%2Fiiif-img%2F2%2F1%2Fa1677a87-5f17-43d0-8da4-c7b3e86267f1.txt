Obought and paid for.As to the law, this seems to bo all there is.The laws and regulations as to the exploitation ofcoal, 011 and other mineral on the Reservation are different forthe treaty part of the Reservation and the Exeoutiye ordor geotions. As elsewhere etated in this memorandum, there are atpresent about 3,000,000 acres in the troaty section of the Resorvation and about 9,000,000 acres in the Executive order extension.While the present problem will in all probability beconfined to the treaty part of the Reservation, it would be well,in my opinion, for me, il I take this position, to have an understanding with the Department as to what its policy may be in regard to oil or other mineral exploration on Executive order partsof the Reservation inasmuch as undoubtedly the Indiane, if I ammade their supervisory officer, will want to know all about thesituation on the Reservation as a whole. The present regulationsas to the leasing of Tribal lands for mining purposes are containedin Circular foted September 20, 1913, by A. A. Jones, Mirat Assistant Secretary, and amendments of May 2, 1917, and February 25, 1921.These are, I take it, the only regulations now extant on the subJect with the exception of certain regulations to govern prospectingfor and mining of meta111ferous minerals of wallotted lands ofIndian Reservations approved September 16, 1919. These wereamended on March 3, 1921.
