Health.The field matrons make a house to house visit at leastonce a week. They have set aside two days a week for thiswork. I have no criticism to offer in regard to work of ourfield matrons. We have four among the Hopis and they are firstclass in every respect and are getting excellent results. Itis impossible to spread their usefulness to the Nava jos whooccupy a large country. What we need for the Nava jos is similarfield matron districts.Respectfully submitted,hezaji huenEdgar/ K. Miller,Superintendent.EKM/ RE
