My Dear Sir:-
I inclose in this a copy of a communication from the
Hon. Commissioner of Indian Affairs, which explains itself.
I am sorry that he has made such a decision; But when once his
word has gone out there is no help for it.
As I wrote you once before, if you wish to become a teacher and
are ready for our Norinal Ciass, I can pay your transportation and re
ceive you at the school at any time,
If you are so desirous of coming here that you will pay your
own way, there is nothing to hinder your coming.
I am most truly yours,
A H. Victs
Superintendent.
