The structurehas approximately600 feet of closure, is 11 milesin length( basedon the lowestclos ing contour) and is about3 milesin width.The lower Navajosend stonecoversthe surfaceof the structure.Such an area is difficultto develop, as the nearest railroadpointis Farmington, 88 milesdistant; watersupplyhas to be securedfrom springsand coal for fuel has to be transportedfrom20 to 25 miles.The apex of the structure, on which the test well is located, is 25 mileswest and 2 miles northof the southeastcornerof the stateof Utah. A good roadcon nects the prospectivefieldwith Shiprockand Farmington, the road havingbeen constructednew in placesand re pairedconsiderablyat a largeexpenditureof moneyby theSouthwestCompany.In the writer'sestimation, the BoundaryButtestructureis one of potentialvalue, whichshoulddevelop into an importantfield, althoughit will be slow of development.GYPS UM CREEKSTRUCTURE.The San JuanOil Company, subsidiaryto the Midwest group, starteddrillinga test well on the GypsumCreek structurein November1923and has reacheda depthof 2083 feetat thistime, withoutencounteringproduction. The objectivehorizonsare sandsin the Goodridge( Pennsylvanian) formationand the hole at its presentdepthhas probablyconstituteda satisfactorytest.The top of the Pennsylvanianwas foundat approxime.tely380 feet and a slightshowingof oil at 500 feet was theonlyin dicationof oil encountered. Allthe sanden counteredwere tightlycementedwith an abundanceoflime and calcareousmaterial.The GypsumCreek structureis locatedabout 15milesacrossthe state line in Arizona, southof the old San Juan oil fieldof southernUtah. The structureis an anticlinevery similarto that of BoundaryButteand is about45 mileswestof that structure.D
