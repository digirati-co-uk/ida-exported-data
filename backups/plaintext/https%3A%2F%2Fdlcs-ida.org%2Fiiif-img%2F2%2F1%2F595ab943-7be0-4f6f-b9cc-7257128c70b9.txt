Annual Report, 1913.
Section II- Health
The general health conditions at the Schools
and Agency can be considered as very good. The small
boys dormitory was repaired, the baths and toilets being
replaced with new ones. One cottage at the Agency is
not connected with the sewer system. This will be
attended to at an early date. The school is still
overcrowded, but the climate is heal thful except for
the sudden changes which are conducive to catarrhal
conditions of the upper air passages.
The school has often been subjected to
epidemics of children' s diseases. The pupils are
constantly in contact with the camp indians, so it is
easy for them to receive infections. Too little
attention is paid to epidemics among the camp Indians
and epidemics sweep unchecked from one side of the
reservation to the other, causing great loss of life
among children.
The sanitary condition of the Navajo home is
good compared with other tribes. The climate is in
their favor. They usually keep the home surroundings
clean. Open at the top, the dwelling has fine
ventilation, but the dirt floor, upon which they eat,
carries much infection. Mainly it is the lack of
personal hygiene that accounts of so much disease.
