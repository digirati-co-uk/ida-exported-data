OUR PROPHECY
This is the year 1958. I have often wondered what happened to the
senior class of 1948. Where would I find information about them? Whilo
walking through down town Santa Fe, I find to my surprise a fortune
teller. She tells me that many things can be seen through a crystal
ball.
As we look into the crystal ball we see an old senior of the class
of 1948, Lucy Avila. After graduating Lucy had gone back to work at
Chief Weavers for a while. She then married her old high school boy
friend, Manuel Guiterrez. Manuel is a carpenter and works at his trade
in the Sandia Pueblo.
What is this I see??? Pauline Gomez who has kept the boys in the
class busy killing all the bugs and worms that crossed her path is a
professor of bugology in the University of Connecticut.
The crystal ball changes to a different scene. We see a lady scold
ing her children for being mischievous. To my surprise I found it to be
Connie Cata, a senior in the class of' 48. A month after graduation she
married a guy from Santo Domingo.
