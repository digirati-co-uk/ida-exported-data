Annual RÄ“port
1917
San Juan School& Agency
A new sawmill plant was constructed above Toadlena during the year.
There is sufficient timber to last the mill at least ten years. Buildings
for housing the sawyer and loggers have been erected and the plant is
ready to manufacture lumber, which will be needed for new school con
struction and for the use of the Indians, as well as for general school
and agency use.
An agricultural fair has been held at this agency anually for
several years past. No fair was held in the fall of 1916. Pressing
reed of construction work on the reservation and at the school and
the many vacancies existing in the school and agency forces rendered
the holding of the fair impracticable and inexpedient.
The grazing
No grazing permits are issued on this reservation.
of outside stock would be detrimental to the interests of the Indians,
as there is no more range than is necessary for their own sheep and
cattle.
No Indians have been exployed under the supervision of Mr.
Dagenett during the year.
Population.

under this jurisdiction and such organizations are not considered
necessary or advisable.

reservation.
