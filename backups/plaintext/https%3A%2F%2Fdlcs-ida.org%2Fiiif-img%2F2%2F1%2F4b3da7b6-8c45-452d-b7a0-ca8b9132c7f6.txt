In October of 1930 the school became known as the Arts and Crafts School. Painting, silver work, weaving, leather craft and embroidery were added to the academic curriculum. Many now famous artists and craftsmen graduated from SFIS. A shop maintainedby the department sold many fine examples of the work done by the students.The fall of 1958 again brought changes to the school. The high school was transferred to Albuquerque, and SFIS became a Junior High, with the San Felipe 5th and 6thgrades added. In 1959 the art department was removed entirely, except for painting,and the school opened to grades one through nine. In the fall of 1960 a new Arts andCrafts department, entirely seperated from the academic department, was opened to highschool graduates, or those over eighteen years of age, from all over the U. S. Thegrades and Junior High continued in the academic department. Many of the houses onthe campus were torn down, and the boys of the arts and crafts department were housedin the Employees Club. All but those employees in strategic jobs were required tofind housing off- campus.The ninth grade class of 1962 will be the last to graduate from Santa Fe IndianSchool as there again will be great changes in the fall of 1962. Under a new name,The Institute of American Indian Art, many of the old, familiar buildings will havebeen torn down to be replaced by newer and larger structures. Older students, fromthe tenth grade through two years of post graduate work, will be occupied with bothacademic work and the many facets of the arts. But the quiet beauty of landscapedlawns under the tall poplar trees will remain to bring fond memories to all of thosewho have graduated from this friendly and well loved institution of learning.
