-3-4-3in the past, the stock business in this County 18 practically ruined. Thewhite citizen might st111 find range in summer for his stock, but hewould have no range left in winter and would be compelled to leave theCounty or quit the business.That with out the stock interest of said county we cannot raisetaxes sufficient to pay the expenses of the Coutnty w Government. Weand the citizens we represent, wish to deal with entire faimess with theIndians, recognizing them as an inferior race and bearing with all theirshort comings, yet, we feel that we are legally and justly entitled tomore consideration than we have had in the past by the Indians, and therepresentatives of the Government who have been their advisors. We feelthat they should be required to remain upon their reservat ions withtheir stock and thus be kept from coming in contact with the whitesettler. And if the Government finds that they cannot, in justice to theIndians require them to remain on their said reservations, and permitsthem to leave the reservations and come, with their flocks and herds intosaid County of Coconino where they receive the protection of ourTerritorial Government and incur to our county and Territory thenecessary expense of such protection, then we must insist that theirproperty be taxed the same as ours to help sustain the expenses of suchGovernment, but this#*#*****# position and condition of affairs will notprotect the public from the necessary and unavoidable conflict growingout of range contention between the white settler and the Indians, whocannot be made to understand the rights of the white settler as werecognize them. We understand the policy of the Government to be toetquite all contentions between the Indians and white settlers, and toremove as far as possible all cause of diference and trouble betweenthem; this we know fron recent actual experience can only be done inthis case by requiring the Indians to stay within their prescribedreservations. We regret that in the past many parties who have controlldthe policy of the Government in their dealings with the Indians have nothad the personal experience and opportunities of knowing them as we haveWe think, and know that in many instances the policy would have beendifferent.
