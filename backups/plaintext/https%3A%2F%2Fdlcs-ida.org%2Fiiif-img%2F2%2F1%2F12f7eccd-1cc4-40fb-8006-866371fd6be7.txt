July 24, 1914.Pueblo DAY SCHOOLS, Albuquerque.NARRATIV E.Section II--------- Health.1. An epidemic of typhus fever among the Canoncito Nava joswas discovered in early spring of the present fiscal year, fromwhich four deaths resulted. Active measures to prevent thespread of this alarming disease were taken by Dr. Day, thePhysician in charge, and due to the prompt authorization by theOffice of sufficient money to maintain a quarantine it was stampedout and severe methods taken to entirely eradicate all danger ofits spread. Much of the clothing, bedding, etc., of the Navajoswas destroyed and some Government property which was used at thetime in caring for the sick was also destroyed. The houses infectedwere burned, and in fact so general a cleaning made that there isabsolutely no danger of a recurrence.Small- pox broke out among the Nava jos living near MountTaylor and it was feared this might spread to the Pueblos who livenearby. But owing to the fact that practically all have beenvaccinated, not a Pueblo contracted the disease, though it didspread a great deal among their Mexican neighbors, who are livingunder exactly the same conditions, but have not had the benefit ofthe administration of Dr. Dillon whose vork has been so efficientamong the Indians where he is located.
