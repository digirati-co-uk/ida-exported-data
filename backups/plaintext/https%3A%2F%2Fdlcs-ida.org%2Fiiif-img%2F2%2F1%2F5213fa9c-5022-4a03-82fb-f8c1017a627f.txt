agreement faithfully, as also had the Indians; that they were whollysatisfied with the compact and the manner of its observance, and did notwish it to be disturbed.Ah- Co- Er- She, one of the Indi ans to whom a portion of my land had then been allotted, was present, and stated that theallotment worked a great hardship on him, that he had been allotted apart of my land upon which he ha i never had any claim and did not want;that it was on the white settler's side of the treaty line; that his ownland on the Indian's side that he had cleared up and grubbed at greatlabor and on which he had fully grown fruit trees in bearing, and that hehad occupied and cultivated for 20 years had been taken from him andallotted to other Indians. That he felt so badly over this action of theallotting officer that he had gone to Flagstaff to try and secure citizenship papers so that he could degally enter and improve and hold hisclaim.As to the Indians to whom my land has been allotted:Ah- Co- ErShe( whose allotment is numbered 9) has never done a day's work on anypart of my land save when in my employ. He has worked for me frequentlyfor wages-- we have been and are now the best of friends.I am willingnow to submit my c la im upon his statement of the case, and to abide theresult, knowing that he will tell the truth. He is an honest, straightforwardman.He does not make the slightest cla im to may land, andduring all the years of our acquaintance, there has never been any dispute or trouble of any kind between us.He denies positively Mahugh'sstatement that he ever asked Mahugh to allot him a part of my land, butsays that he could not ask such a thing, as he had never owned it, norhad any right to claim it.He said to Mahugh in my presence, afterlearning of the allotments," Why have you given away the land I haveworked on so hard for years( meaning his own land on the east side of thetreaty line) to another Indian?"Mahugh replied:" You have never askedme for any land-- why did you not ask me?"La- Toke- She did not settle in this vicinity until long afterthe land in question had been settled upon and cultivated by the whitesettlers. He never made any claim whatever to them until after the allotment, and has never made any settleme nt or improvement whatever upon it.
