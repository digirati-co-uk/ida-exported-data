0EVALUATIONOF THE CURRICULUMFavorable Side:It is the trend of the times to formulate an educationalprogram especially adapted to the needs of the people whom it is toserve. That was the primary aim of" A Tentative Curriculum forEducation of the Navajoes" on which we worked last summer. Whilewe know that our curriculum is rudimentary, yet we feel that it isa step in the right direction. Under the old educational program,it is plain that no' startlingly satisfactory results were accomplished. Navajoes, educated in our schools, are not able as aclass to compete with the white man in industrial work, nor evenwith the old Navajoes as weavers, sheepherders, and silversmiths,when they return to the reservation.Our work this past year has been largely experimental, and itwas the understanding that the curriculum should be revised and added to following such experimentation.I believe that our procedure for curriculum construction iscorrect-- namely, to understand our local situation; to divide lifeactivities into major fields; to list specific objectives and cokresponding suggested activities for realizing these objectives;and then to endeavor to incorporate these objectives and activitiesinto teaching units, well selected for different levels of growth.This is a program based upon experiences and activities ascons trasted with that based upon the older, more formal organization of school subjects." Emphasis has been shifted from subjectmatter to activities meeting the needs of the Navajoes.---Our curriculum stresses need and utility rather than formal schooling." Chadsey.I think it is a point in our favor that there is no set amountor set place for academic work in each level but the academic workis to be presented whenever and wherever the children show readiness for it.I also approve of the fact that ethical training was not regarded as a separate field of human endeavor but was so correlatedwith all the other fields as to be rendered inseparable. The objectives and activities in every field were so planned as to contributeto growth in desirable morals and habits and to give children practical experience in dependability, cooperation, perseverance, etc.
