Dear friend:
Replying to your letter of March 21st and 28th, Mr.
Goinge will be at Gallup next Wednesday morning, April 5th, and
wishes you to furnish him conveyance
from Gallup to the Fort.
I will carry him on the pay roll up to and including
April
5th.
Mr. S. W. Simeox, the foxner Baker here, asks if yon car
furnish him any employment
.
In regard to securing children for the school, I am satis
fied from what you say that it is useless to try to do anything
upon the reservation
at present.
After
you have taken charge
and become somewhat acquainted
with the Indians I think we may be
* ble to secure some children in the vicinity of 7t. Wingate and
Mitchell
Whenever
you think it is the proper time to make an
effort I shall be ready to co- operate with you.
Very
truly
yours
,
Superintendent
.
