I. S.,The ones we loved the best,I see our senior class among my souvenirs.A few more tokens rest,Within my treasure chest,The teachers did their best,To lead us to success.I count them one by one,As recollections come,Our friendships we hoid dear among my souvenirs.llllllllllllHIOur high school days are done,Life' s work has just begun,It now devolves on each of us to do his best.A lot of knowledge learned,For more we' ll always yearn,While walking through our tinted path of life.A few more steps ahead,Will show the way we tread,Our good old times we' ve had will give us consolation.Those memories near our hearts,With them we' ll never part,We bid you all adieu in leaving A.
