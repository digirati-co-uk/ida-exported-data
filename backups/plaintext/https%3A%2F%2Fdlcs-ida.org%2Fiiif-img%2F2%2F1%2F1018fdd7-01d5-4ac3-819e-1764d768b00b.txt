HOPI INDIAN AGENCY
ANNUAL REPORT
NARRATIVE SECTION
Section II....
..... Health
Health conditions
during the past winter were exceeding
ly bad. Epidemics
of measles, influenza, whooping cough, and
other diseases spread out over the reservation. It was a very
bad year for the Indians and for our work, we having many
cases of death. At the present writing conditions are very
much improved.
The general sanitary conditions of the reservation are
good.
There is a continual improvement in this respect.
Special reports to the Office during this year show this
gratifying condition.
( a). The field matrons have done wonderful work toward
improving home and sanitary conditions. I am glad to state
that the Navajos are also improving their homes and are
settling more permanently and developing greater crop areas,
water, eto.
( b). Field matrons assist the Hopis in caring for the
sick. Our hospital and health service has been greatly im
proved this past year, doing very fine work, functioning at
nearly one hundred per cent efficiency, but we need a sana
torium for the care and treatment of tuberculosis.
A very
proper and satisfactory place for such an institution would
be Oraibi. This matter has been placed before the Office, and
I understand action has been taken toward soliciting the ap
propriation for such an institution.
( c). The only way we can handle tuberculosis patients is
to get their consent or the consent of their parents to send
them away to sanatoriums. Many parents will not consent to
this, consequently we have a number of people with tuberculosis
on the reservation who do not have the care they should have.
We have a number of school children returned from non- reserva
tion schools who should be in some institution. If we had a
sanatorium on the reservation it could take care of all these
patients.
