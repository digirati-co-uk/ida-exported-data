The only records available for determining the contageous andinfectious diseases treated by the physician for the fiscal year 1930are taken from the annual report of that year.These records show:Veneral Diseases 42 cases, 37 males and 5 femalesInfluenza 386 cases, 25l males and 135 femalesDysentery 48 cases, 31 males and 17 femalesTrachoma 6 cases 4 males and 2 femalesOne cannot determine if the se are" Hospi tal" or" rest ofAge ncy" cases or both. Al so these records do, not show whether they weretreated by the physician or not. The" Rest of the Agencyn for part of thefiscal year 1930, was under the care of a field nurse working for theBas tern Association. Apparently the then used monthly reports give veryunsatisfactory detailed information in regard to cantageous and infectious diseases.R. A. Carrow, MD.
