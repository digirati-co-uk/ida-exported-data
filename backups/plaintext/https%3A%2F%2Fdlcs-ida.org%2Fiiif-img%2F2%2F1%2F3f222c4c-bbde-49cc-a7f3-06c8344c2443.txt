The weekly" Congress" composed of high school classes is to be con
tinued this year, beginning in December. It is hoped that this civic
project will be as beneficial and as interesting as it was last year.

making a high average grade in this project, it would add zest and hard
work to the course where interest for the course alone might lag with
so me pupils.
This is to be a curriculum building year with us in the hope of get
ting the essentials and getting them well. The course at the univ ersi ty
this year, has made every teacher enthusiastic on the subject of curricu
lum, and each will not only be very willing to assist in the work, but
will know how to do it more scientifically than before.

The office work has been rather heavy. The law requiring contracts
in cases of all purchases in excess of$ 100. has worked a great hardship,
and so far as we are able to see has not benefited the school or the
service. We have prepared ninety- two such contracts.
