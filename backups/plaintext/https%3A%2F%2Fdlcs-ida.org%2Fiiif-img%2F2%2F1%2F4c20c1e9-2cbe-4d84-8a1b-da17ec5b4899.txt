SYNOPSIS OF REPORT OF INSPECTOR
PRANK C. ARMSTRONG,
â€¢, on the
SANTA FE SCHOOL, N. M.
Dated. JANY. 12TH 1889.
Aotion of the Indian Bureau to
be noted in this Column.
An appropriation of$ 25, 000 exists for
the building of an industrial school for In
dians at this place. Such a school here is
entirely useless, and such an out lay would
be a was te of funds. There are al ready two
schools here, and neither fu 11; one un der the
Catholics, the other under the Congregational-
ists. 85 miles from here there is a large
Government Industrial School at Albuque rque,
which is not, and never has been nu11. At
the same place there is a contract school
under the Presbyterians. Sixty miles below
here on the R. R. at San Bernalillo, is a
contract school for girls. None of the se
schools are full and never wi 11 be. Besides
these boarding schools there are day schools
under the different religious orders on n early
every Pueblo. An expenditure of the money
to build an industrial school here, would
benefit the contractor and labor ers employed
in the work of construction only. It could
never be filled with pupils.
The re are
schools en ough in N. Mexico for all the In
di ans, and an increase of school facilities is
