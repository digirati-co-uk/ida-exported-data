An Account of the Work Done During the Year
The children in Progress Level B1 were very individualistic
notwithstanding their homogeneous background of experiences.
Since there was a wide range of ages and capacities, these child
ren differed greatly in interests, needs and abilities. The year's
program of activities had, accordingly, to give these children
various opportunities to produce individual and social growth.
In
order to give this group the information and citizenship training
needed, two units of work were chosen.
The first unit was undertaken to acquaint the group with liv
ing here at school and was entitled" Our School".
This unit of
work was very necessary since there is so much more equipment at
the school than at home. Knowledge, language, and citizenship as
required here were stressed throughout this unit.
During the early part of the first unit, the children needed
aid in making such simple statements as:
Dan's truck has four wheels."
" Dillon is making a car."
" The girls made a green house."
" This way tomorrow."( Patomime making of truck).
A few of the more immature children talked freely even during the
first part of the year. The following statements were made during
painting by Dillon Platero:
" I like flowers".
" I like this tree".
