An Account of the Work Done During the YearThe children in Progress Level B1 were very individualisticnotwithstanding their homogeneous background of experiences.Since there was a wide range of ages and capacities, these children differed greatly in interests, needs and abilities. The year'sprogram of activities had, accordingly, to give these childrenvarious opportunities to produce individual and social growth.Inorder to give this group the information and citizenship trainingneeded, two units of work were chosen.The first unit was undertaken to acquaint the group with living here at school and was entitled" Our School".This unit ofwork was very necessary since there is so much more equipment atthe school than at home. Knowledge, language, and citizenship asrequired here were stressed throughout this unit.During the early part of the first unit, the children neededaid in making such simple statements as:Dan's truck has four wheels."" Dillon is making a car."" The girls made a green house."" This way tomorrow."( Patomime making of truck).A few of the more immature children talked freely even during thefirst part of the year. The following statements were made duringpainting by Dillon Platero:" I like flowers"." I like this tree".
