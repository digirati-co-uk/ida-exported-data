12.37645which I was unable to verify his said affidavit of June 2nd, 1898,or interrogate him regarding same. 7 II went over the tracts of land in dispute, examined thethree dams and reservoirs constructed by Mormons in Reservoir Wash,and the development of water by them from the spring on west side ofsaid wash near its mouth, known as the upper one of the three springsopposite Nebeker's house, also the dam constructed by Mormons inMoencopie Wash about half a mile above Moencopie Pueblo, which damthe Mormons claim was cut by the Indians three years ago.I alsolooked over the improvements made by Mr. Nebeker and his grantorson the land covered by the Indian Homestead Allotment of Ah- cow- ershee( Claim No.9) which tract, from the thrifty orchard and largenursery upon it, together with its high state of cultivation, represents a large amount of labor expended upon it.There is no evidence tending to prove that the Indians evercultivated any portion of the land claimed by Nebeker in said allotment, and as so much labor has been expended upon this tract byNebeker and his grantors I would respectfully recommend that theallotment made to Ah- cow- or- shes( claim No.9) be cancelled, and thatall of said allotment lying north of the south fence on said tract,indicated on enclosed sketch or diagram( Exhibit 31) as" New fenceafter allotment", be awarded said Ashton Nebeker.
