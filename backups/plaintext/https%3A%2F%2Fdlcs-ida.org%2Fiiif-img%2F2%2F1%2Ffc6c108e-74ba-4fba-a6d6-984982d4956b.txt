Daily life at Santa Fe IndianSchool is a....Special Place!!!!!!!!!!... always to remain true tomy Indian Self. I have learnedthat education and wisdomcan happen whenever peoplespeak with good thoughts ina caring, supportive environment, and that my teachers areall those who help me to understand myself and the world.There is a larger society, alarger world that I must learnto live and survive, but I mustnever forget wholam and whereI am from. The past helps meto see the future. SFIS is a specialplace, as special as life itself, fixedin time, for us to share togetheras the stars in the night.<<>>Some of ourcommunityat SFIS.34
