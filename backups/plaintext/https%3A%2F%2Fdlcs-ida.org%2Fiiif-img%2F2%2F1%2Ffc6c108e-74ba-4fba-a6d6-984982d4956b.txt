Daily life at Santa Fe Indian
School is a....
Special Place!!!!!!!!!!
... always to remain true to
my Indian Self. I have learned
that education and wisdom
can happen whenever people
speak with good thoughts in
a caring, supportive environ
ment, and that my teachers are
all those who help me to under
stand myself and the world.
There is a larger society, a
larger world that I must learn
to live and survive, but I must
never forget wholam and where
I am from. The past helps me
to see the future. SFIS is a special
place, as special as life itself, fixed
in time, for us to share together
as the stars in the night.<<>>
