Mr. I. W. Dwire,
Taos, N. M.
Dear Sir:
While at Albuquerque this month I went to see U. S. Attorney
Childers; Mr. Fornoff went with me; we talked over the laos liquor
business, and the propriety of immediately arresting the two parties,
or letting the metter rest until next term of court. Mr. Childers as
sured me that he would do just as I desired, but Fornoff seemed to think
we stood a better chance for conviction If we let the matter rest now,
and just as soon as the Grand Jurry indicted the two boot- leggers to
court for trial/ In this way
arrest them and bring them before the
they would have no opportunity to fix the jury. You will therefore un
derstand the seeming delay. This is written you in confidence, as it is
best that
Taos should know nothing of this.
Respectfully
Kameroll

P. S. I met many parties from Roswell, and they spoke very highly of
our boys; I sent them all messages etc.
