SECTION IV,- INDUSTRIES.The Navajo8 of this reservation are sheep heerders, many ofthem own large flooks and some own a great number of cattle andponies. The up- breeding of their stock is of the greatestimportance, so that their she op will produce finer wool and theirlambs bring better prices on the market, and their stock make betterbeef. On this reservation I would estimate that 75 per cent of theshe op are improved about 50 per cent of the cattle. The Indiansthemselves are very interested in the improvement of their shoep;they realize the benefits to be had in the production of betterwool and that better lambs bring higher prices, eto., and theylook forward each year to the profit to be gained. The acreagefarmed by the Navajos is not increased to any extent, however theyraise an abundance of corn, potatoes and various kinds of vegetables.Dry farming is the principal methods used here; the Indians irrigatetheir fields in the spring with flood waters and when the soilbecomes we 11 saturated with water they let it remain for severaldays and they then plant their crops, and through proper cultivationthey manage to tide their or ops over until the rainy season begins,and in this way they are able to produce a great deal of food stufffor their own u se. Nearly every family on this reservation cultivatesa certain amount of land so that they can have corn and othervegetables for their use.There are no allotments on the treatyreservation. There were a few allotments made on the executive or derreservation in 1907 and 1908. Quite a number of Indians on the publicdomain have been allotted and have received trust patents for theirallotments.The general class of improvementson this reservation- 10
