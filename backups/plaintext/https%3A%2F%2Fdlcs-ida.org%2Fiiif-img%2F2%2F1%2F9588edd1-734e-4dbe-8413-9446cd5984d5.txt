least are not suitable persons for positions in the Indian service.
It occurs to me that the Indian Office and the bonded officer
should
have control of this matter.
In reviewing the work of this school, the following
that
facts should be born in mind; viz. 70 per cent of the pupils
have come direct from the camps, without any practical knowledge
of civilization
; that 53 per cent of the pupils have had but
eight months of actual school work; that the average age of the
pupils is but 12 1/2 years,
These face alone make it impossible
for this school to present a favorable a showing as older schools
where a majority of the reools
pupil have been in school
nunber of years and the aver forotally from 15 10 18 years,
In closing, I desire to express my thanks
for the courteous treatment and prompt action of your office in
the transaction of business.
Respectfully submitted,
Samten Sei Cash
Superi tendent,
The Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
