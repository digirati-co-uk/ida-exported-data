Hope by Santana M. Shorty
I am the light when you are plummeted into
darkness
I am that last donut in the pastry shop
I am that one pair of shoes left in your size
I am that extra key you have in your wallet
I am always there
I sneak behind your good and bad thoughts,
that spare tire ready to be used
whenever you need me,
I' m there
I tickle your mind and buzz in your brain
clueing you into my existence
you cannot use me up
i' m a rechargeable battery
I' m never lost,
but always found
that one little sunlight
Candy in Life by. Jordan S
So confused like the swirls in a lollipop
different emotions equal the colors of flavors
Red for anger
Blue for sadness
Green for happiness
Black for depression
White for positive feelings
Every new day adds a new swirl of confusion
