Each oneof these girls so married is purchased. I have at this time a casebefore me, in which a girl of thirteen years of age was sold inO marriage to a man, perhaps twenty- two or twenty- three years of age,for six horses.This custom has grown up within the last twentyyears, and it should be abolished.Efforts are being made tocorrect this matter by separating the parties when they have beenmarried, and by punishing not only the husband, but also the fatherwho sells his daughter in marriage. I fear however that we will makesmall progress until some very severe punishments are administered--perhaps more severe then it is within my power to administer.Polygamy exists to some extent among the Navajos.Efforts havebeen made to put a stop to it, and I can say that now very fewpolygamous marriages are entered into.The Navajo Indian, however,does not consider the marriage vow seriously, and families arebroken up without the formality of a divorce, the Indian marryingaga in at an early date frequently.This is a custom hard to correct.The morality of the Na va jo is probably as good as that of anyIndian I have seen. However, it is far from being ideal. ThereShas been some improvement along this line, but the work is slow.At least two pla in cases of rape came before me during the past year.In these cases severe punishments were given to each offender.
