Everyone has a Sweet Tooth every
now and then. Its what people from
Wales, England might call “ Feeding
The Soul ”. You know what I' m
talking about people- those times
when you crave chocolate, or have
the urge to chew some kind of
sweet gum. We have these sweet
tooths because of childhood
memories of our favorite candy.
We' ve all eaten a lot of candy as
young- little- tots. Like when your
older sister or brother gave you a
mini Snickers bar, or your temporary
fetish with all the goodies after you
get back from trick- or- treating oon
Halloween. The majority of
sophomore students at SFIS all
agree on one valuable piece of
candy... chocolate. Regardless of
the kind of chocolate these
students are fans of the delectable
taste of pure sweetness.
