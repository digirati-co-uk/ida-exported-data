RIVALCICLETEKA Greetingto the GraduatingClassFROMSophie D. Aberle, General SuperintendentIN this greeting to the graduating class, I want to say three things, sayingthem as briefly and plainly as though I were speaking to each one of youface to face.First, I want to congratulateyou on finishing your school course. It hastaken work to do so and steadiness and self sacrifice. Again and again, ithas called for your being willing to do what was best for the school instead ofexactly what you yourself wanted to do.Next, I want to remind you that these same qualities of energy andsteadiness and sense of group responsibilityare preciselythe qualities you willneed outside of school if you are to be the worth- while men and women youmean to be.| And last, I want to urge you to keep on learning. Agriculture and craftsare the two great hopes of the Indians. In one of these, or in whatever workyou choose, set yourself, boy and girl alike, the goal of doing your pieceof work better each year than you did the year before. The Indian Bureauprovides institutes and conferences and bulletins, some of which will help you,but the determinationto keep on learning has to come from inside you. Ibelieve that determinationis there, or you would not have kept on this long;and so with each of you, wherever you go, I am sending out not only mygood wishes for your future but my belief in your power to make that futurea fine and useful one.1220193717Page Six
