( 8)The work of Inspector L.A. Dorrington has been most careful andconscientions, he having given due consideration to the views of thepresent Superintendent.The result of the visit of the unauthorizeddelegation of Pueblo Indians to Washington in June 1921 was clearlyshown to be an assumption of authority on their part, followed bynew efforts toward contention and revolt on their return.The reportsof Inspector Dorrington will show this.Both the Inspector and theSuperintendent found it necessary to quell these attempts to furtherresist Governmental authority, and to their surprise learned thatof ders issued to such Indians by the Secretary's Office and theIndian Office were being used as authority to oppoge Governmentalsupervision.The unrest and dissatisfaction among the Pueblo Indiansof New Mexico, based on the delay in clarification of their statusand agency of supervision, continues to present daily irritation tothe Superintendent charged with the administration of their affairs.Those Indians who have sufficient intelligence to understand aDepartmental order are few, and the many reactionaries continue toassert authorities and privileges based upon old tribal custom andreligion, all of which are opposed to the Regulations of theDepartment and the State law.This condition will never be remedieduntil such time as the Congress of the United States defines thestatus of the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, --whether or not they arecitizens subject only to protective land and title regulations, orwards of the United States having a status similar to that of otherunallotted, non- citizen" reservation" indians.
