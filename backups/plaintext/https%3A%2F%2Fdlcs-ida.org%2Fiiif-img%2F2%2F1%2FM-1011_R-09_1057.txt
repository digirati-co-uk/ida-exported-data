Annual Report-- 3.
On the other hand I am of the opinion that the use
of drugs has increased among the Indians. At Yerington I
an informed that a majority of the adults are addicted to
the use of narcotics. Fortunately the Indians of Pyrenid
Lake and Fort McDerritt have thus far not become addicted to
the use of drugs and narcotics.
The Indians of this jurisdiction do not re. ke any
intoxicating beverages or preparations, nor do they seen to
know anything about pe yote or me scal.
