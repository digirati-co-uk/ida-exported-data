by the younger Indians of the reservation, they came out boldly
in favor of such division and for a number of weeks before the
final decision was made these young men-- more especially the re
turned students-- talked and worked among the other Indians until
when the final vote was taken but nine teen voted against such a
partitioning of the lands, while more than 300 were favorable.
It is through this claimed ownership of the lands that the older
Indians have held their power and prestige in the tribe and this
acceptance of an equitable division of the land has been a decid
ed forward move as the younger members of the tribe have thus
obtained prestige and it is felt that they will retain this in
future activities and future development.
