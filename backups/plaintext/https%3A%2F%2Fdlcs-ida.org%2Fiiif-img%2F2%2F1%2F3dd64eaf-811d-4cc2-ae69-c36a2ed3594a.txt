I cannot toostrongly recommend that this roatter be given theimmed ia te and very careful consideration of the office,Ramebing botethe SudIt is quite evident from the discussions had atthe two meetings of the tribal council and variousother meetings with the Indians that the sheep situationis the one in which the Indiang themselves are notvi tally interested. The improvement in the grade oftheir stock has been very marked, especially in theSan Juan jurisdiction, and to some extent in the others,and the Indians themselves are very keen to securebetter bucks. Some of the superintendents have beenand still are keenly alive to this need, and are doingevery thing they possibly can to meet the demands of theIndians for better breeding animals.
