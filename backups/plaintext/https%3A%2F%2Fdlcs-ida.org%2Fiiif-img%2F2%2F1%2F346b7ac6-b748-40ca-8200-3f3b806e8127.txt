Section 1-Law and Order- Continued.Indians.Peyote and mescal are not used by the pupils ofthis school. I do not believe their use is on the increase on reservations since prohitition was adopted.I have been on some of the reservations and in contactand communication with all of the Superintendents, excepting one, and have heard nothing to indicate that thetwo narcotics are being used more now than in the past.My opinion is that they are used less. The Indianshave been accustomed in the past, no doubt, to satisfythe desire for strong drink after they have been indulging by the use of peyote or mescal. Now that the opportunity for obtaining liquor is very small, they do notindulge in strong drink so much and acquire the" hangover" which they were accustomed to satisfy by resorting to the use of peyote or mescal. I have no knowledge as to how or where the Indians obtain peyote andmescal or as to whether Indians or whites sell it.There is no gambling among the pupils of thisschool.There has been no legislation in the state bearing on Indian affairs or Indian property rights.OV
