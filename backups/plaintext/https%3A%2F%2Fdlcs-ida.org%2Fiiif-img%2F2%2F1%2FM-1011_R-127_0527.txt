Annual Report19 13Santa Fe Schooland AgencyNARRATIVE,Section 2HealthA step in the right direction toward hettermentof health conditions in the pueblos was taken during thepast year in the establishment of two additional positionsof field matrons in this district, The need of fieldmatrons for the pueblos in supplementing the work of thephysio ians in the treatment of trachoma and other diseasesamong the Indians, as wall as the almost unlimited Tieldof work to be done by them industrially among the Indianwomen in the introduction of sanitary and improved methodsof housekeeping was emphasized in my annual report of lastyear..From observation I am impressed with the factof the broad scope of work to be done by the field matrons,A very great deal may be done by them through their influence with the Indian women, and especially with the returnod students, in the improvement of housekeeping arrange.ments and in providing for more light and air in the houses,as well as teaching them to sew and to provide more sanitaryand intelligent care of the ir babies and the sick. Then too,the greatest dificulty experienced in treatment of diseasesamong Indians is the inability to insure that the treatmentand medicines prescribed by the doctor is carried out andtaken. The heavy mortality among the old and very youngIndians is due, to a large extent, to their disregard of thedirections of the doctors and wi th the practice of their ownmedicine mon, as well as poor housing conditions... By dailyvisits to the sick in the ir respective pueblos, the fieldmatrons, through their acquaintance and influence, are otmost material assistancs in seeing that the directions ofthe physicians are carried out. Among the more unprogressiveand reactionary of the Indians, it is very dificult in thebeginning to secure satisfactory treatment of their sick,In the work of the field matron, as in all fieldwork of the Service a large proportion of the success whichmay be achieved is due to the industry and personality of theemployee. This, I believe, is true of all work whero the onployee is brought in close touch with the Indians personallyideal of tact of thegreat is necessary in the work fieldmatron, and it is only whenhas ofshe secured the confidence
