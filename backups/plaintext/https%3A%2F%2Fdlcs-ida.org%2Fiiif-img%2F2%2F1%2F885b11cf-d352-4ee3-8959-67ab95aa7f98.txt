SECTION III. Health.
A. Sanatorium
. Th. Sanatorium
continuos
to provide medical attention
,
rest, and pro per nourishment
for the tuberoular Jicarilla Children to the
number of about 80 each year. Their dovelopemont
from under- roight, sub
normal children to a hoalth and happy state is readily discornible
. The
sortioo rendorod to those people by this institution
is betond measure. In
con june tion with the health program carriod on in this institution
to also
give the children their primary â€¢ ducation, and fit them for futuro work at
the boarding school when their physical condition
is much that they may be
transforred
to that school.
Continual
repair and improvements
to the sorely inadequato
property
is carried on, such as repairs to foundations
, boating plant, and general
upkeep. This Sanatorium
is a romodolod boarding
school, greatly inadequato
for our needs and costly to oporato from a standpoint
of personnel
, upkeep,
and general overhead. To very much need a ner building, as the program vill
have to be continued
for many years in order to overcome
the tromondous
tuber
oular arrliction
of this tribe. The success of the institution
so far indi
bates its great worth. One of the major objections
to the prosent building
is
that it is a fire trap that some day might cost the lives of many of the child
ren. Definite favorable
consideration
should be given to its replacement
with
& modern, fire proof, and economically
operated structure.
B. Hospital. Our 24 bod Hospital gains in favor with the Indians each
year. Ma jor noods are an operating room with adequato facilities
for all the
kinds of work that must be done in this isolated jurisdiction
. During the
present year thro- nursos have been employed, but the present plans are to
eliminate
onoof these positions
. Except for periods of capacity usage the
decreased
start should be able to carry on the work, but in periods of stroos
it may be nocessary
to employ tempo rarily.
Usual repairs and upkeo y have been done, one of the buildings remodeled
for Nurse's Quarters
, a new boiler installed and heating system overhaulod
.
All electric wiring has also been overhauled
.
C. Meld Nurse. Field nurse activities
have seen a improvement
this year
with the coming of the now nurse, who seems interested
in her work and in
really accomplishing
results. She contacts more and more of the homes, giving
assistance
and advise where needed, and seems to be gaining the friendship
of
the Indians. Last year I recommended
that Hospital hursos be detailied
in turn
to the field work, hoping that this method would bring the field and the Hospi
tal closer together, but with the present activity of the field nurse, who co- op
erates with other health workers, I believe that the present method may be
continued.
D. Physician
. The Physician
keeps in touch with the Mission School, super
vising their health program, and seeing that as children
show the necessity
of
returning
to the Sanatorium
of going to the Hospital that it is done.
in additon to his regular work at the Sanatorium
, Hospital, and in the field.
