Children
off the Beservation
: Boys and girls of the school are not
allowed
to go off the reservation
or to tow without
any oversight
;
the larger boys are sometimes
allowed
to go town on Saturday afternoon
unaccompanied
by at3 employo; the girls are not granted this privilege
;
in two instances
girls have gone to town alone through a misunderstand

measles, followed by several cases of Pileumonie: these children had to
receive care at night for severe) weeks; the superintendent, the Clerk
and the Industrial Teacher cared for these children at night; the School
Carpenter declined to render any service in this direction and did not,
except one night men he was in charge of the school during the absence
of the Superintendent,
VOIK Trades Boys at the carpenter traie, have been put at other work,
only when they lacked 50aptability for that trade, or when their health
required a change of work, or when the interests of the schoal demandec
