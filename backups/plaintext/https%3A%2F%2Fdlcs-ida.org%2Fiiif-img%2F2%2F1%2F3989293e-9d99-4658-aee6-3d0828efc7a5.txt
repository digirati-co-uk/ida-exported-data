met their needs in supplementing range feed for
their
sheep and goats for the winter.
luch that is good and typical of the American
Indian is the product of out- of- doors and his proverbial
power of observation is born of his direct communion with
nature.
All Indians take kindlier to animal husbandry
than to field work and conditions favoring the sheep industry
on the Jicarilla reservation are unique.
Their summer and
winter range euqally divided give the variety of vegetation
that insures suitable feed for sheep and lambs and the
arid atmosphere and abundant sunshine favors general
healthfulness
of the flocks.
The reservation could support seventyfive to one
hundred thousand sheep and goats and their total number
at this time approximates but twentyfive thousand head,
about one hundred fifty to two hundred sheep to the
average fanily. The average fanily can care for three
aundred to five hundred head with but little more effort
than is required for their present flocks and the larger
numbers would insure an annual income sufficient
to meet
family needs with a surpius that could be used in the
general betterment
of home conditions.
The total return from the individual
flocks of
sheep and goats for the fiscal year totals in excess of
$ 45,000 and this amount is in addition
to the lands and
kids that have been consumed
by the individual
families
.
