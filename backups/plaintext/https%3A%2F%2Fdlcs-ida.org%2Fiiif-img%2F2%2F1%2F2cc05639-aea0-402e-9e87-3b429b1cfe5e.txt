Four years ago, we walked into the
doors of high school not knowing the
outcome. We were the last freshmen to
experience the life of Main Dorm,
Middle Dorm, South Dorm, and Crandell
Hall. It was our sophomore year that we
learned the value of the media in Mrs
Davis' s communicaitons class. Some of
us sewed for Saiz and the
underprivileged children. Last year, we
learned the definition of sovereignty
and why it is important to Native
people. We beat our brains out trying to
meet the deadlines of Mrs. Phelps' s 10
page research page, but it paid off when
Ms. Guerin and Mr. Kambeitz
introduced the Seniors Honors Project
requirments to us. With the completion
of SHP next is the big enchilada; the
show in which we, the class of 2007,
star in, graduation!
