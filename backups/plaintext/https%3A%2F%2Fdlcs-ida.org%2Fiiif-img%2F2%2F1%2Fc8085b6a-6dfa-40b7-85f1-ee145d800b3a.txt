Wash wool in lukewarm suds, pressing down with both hands so that the suds will squeeze through thewool and wash out the particles of dirt. Never rub the wool hard, forin doing so the wool hardens and it is then not easy to card or spin.Wool may be carded before or after it is spun, but it is alwaysbest to dye after spinning.Rinse thoroughly in warm water, two or three times, until thewater is clear. Have the water boiling in a steel or aluminum kettle.When the water is at boiling temperature add as much dye as needed,it depends upon how much wool you are going to color.If desired you may add some vinegar or salt to set the colors.Continue boiling and stir every part so the wool will dye evenly. Boilfor about fifteen or twenty minutes, longer if desired. Remove fromthe stove and place in a pan of cold water. Rinse the second time ifnecessary. The wool is then hung on a line to dry.It is now ready for weaving into a blanket.Illlllllllllllllll||||||||ll|||llllllllllllllllllllllllllGetting Ready for a Squaw DanceMAE PLATERO( Navajo)Squaw dances are given by the Navajo Indians only in the summer.
