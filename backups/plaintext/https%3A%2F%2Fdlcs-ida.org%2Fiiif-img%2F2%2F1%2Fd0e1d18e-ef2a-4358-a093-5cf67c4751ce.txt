O
Hopi 22.
SECTION V--- ALLOTMENTS.
1. We have no allotted land on the Hopi Reserve. I
believe some land was allotted at one time, but that
the Indians refuted the selections and made no effort
to take up and improve such land. It is best to let them
select their own lands, giving them to them permanently
later when the reserve is opened, if that is ever done.
2. There are no allotments on the public domain under
the jurisdiction of this age noy.
