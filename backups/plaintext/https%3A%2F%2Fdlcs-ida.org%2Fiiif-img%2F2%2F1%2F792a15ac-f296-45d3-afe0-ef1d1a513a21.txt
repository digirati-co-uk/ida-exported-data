San Juan School
and Agency
.
A school farm of 100 acres is maintained
, which produces
forage for the school dairy and stock as well as vegetables
and
fruits for the children's
table which are adapted
to local soil
and climatic
conditions
.
The school has an excellent
Dairy Shorthorn
herd.
A dairyman
should be provided
for the care of this herd,
as the entire time of the farmer should be devoted
to farm work.
A gardener
is also needed in order that the most may be
made of the school garden and the instruction
of the boys and
girls in vegetable, small fruit and orchard culture.
No better opportunity
is afforded
anywhere
for Indian boys
and girls to make an independent
, comfortable
, healthful
living
on their return to the reservation
.
Those of the school
boys
who have no Irrigated
land on the reservation
will be given an
opportunity
to take up ten- acre tracts under the Hogback ditch
project, where they can establish a home.
A number of former pupils of this school have already
started
in the improvement
of these mall farms under the Hogback
project on the mesa west of this school. They have been assisted
in this work through the use of school teams and equipment
.
The Navajo children who have been in school and have
returned
to the reservation
, in general, seem to show a real
desire to put their education
to some practical
use.
