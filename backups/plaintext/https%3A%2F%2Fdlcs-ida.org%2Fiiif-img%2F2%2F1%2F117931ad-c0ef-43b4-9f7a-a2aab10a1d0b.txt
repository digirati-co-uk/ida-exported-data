* the one recorded death was of premature birth
in the agency hospital- rightly charged as stillborn.
The heavy infant mortality of 1923 is entirely out of
line but the fact confronts us.

The heavy toll of females
is but the natural gravitation
of tuberculosis
.
The Jicarilla
in institutions
have given poor showing
.
Discussion
of what be the causes in immaterial
in the
annual narrative
.
Improvement
in atmosphere
and general
conditions
date from the individual
participation
in
industrial
effort
. Care of field, garden
, and flock have
given
them the simple
life that their
true nature
craves
a life
where
competition
is light
, exactions
are mild, and
returns
are
reasonably
certain
.
