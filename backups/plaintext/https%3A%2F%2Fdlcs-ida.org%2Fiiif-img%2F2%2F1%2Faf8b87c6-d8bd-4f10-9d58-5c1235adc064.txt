SECTION VI--- SALES.
1. We have no Patents in Fee, nor certificates of
competÃªntoy among these people. None of this reservation
has been sold. It is intact, as set aside by the prseident.
2. No patents in fee have ever issued for Mission lands
that I am awate of. The office took this matter up with
me this past fiscal year and I suggested that none ever
be issued. So long as these Missions get the use of the
lands while they need them I believe that is enough and
the only way to handle the matter. Why give them land
that belongs to Indians and put them in a position to
legally fight the Indian if they deem it best? When
the reserve is opened then matters will be different
and their applications for patents looked at in an entirely
different matter. These Indians would want them to have
any land under patent without their consent. I do not
believe they would consent to patents.
We have had no sales of inherited lands or surplus
lands the past year. I believe none has ever been made.
4. No sales of non- competent Indian lands.
5. Determination of heirs of Indians deceased has never
been attempted on this reserve and I question if it
would ever be wise to start such a thing under present
conditions. This matter takes care of itself according
to tribal and Indian custom. I encourage and advise
sli Indians to divide the property of deceased relatives
now according to the State Laws and am getting fine
results. Formerly the strongest broher got everything he
wanted to take.
6. We have paid out very little individual Indian money,
and that was in acse where an Indian died and it was
his insurance we paid to his widow.
