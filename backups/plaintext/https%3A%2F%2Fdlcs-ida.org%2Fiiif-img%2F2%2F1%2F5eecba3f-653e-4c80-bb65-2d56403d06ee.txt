SFISBasketball is speed. Basketball is concentration. Basketball is power.Basketball is taking it to your defense. Basketball is putting it in their face. Basketball ishearing the crowd roar. Basketball is seeing the crowd â€œ awwwwe", when you miss ashot. Basketball is life, for some and not for others. Basketball is form. It is knowingyou' ll hear the swish of the net from a sweet shot or a missed one. Basketball is whatmakes a person. Mean, mad, sad, happy, psyched, pumped, or pissed. Basketball isa gift. A gift from the greats: Wilt, Dr. J, Pistol, Magic, The Birdman, MJ and somedayKobe. They made what the game is all about. Now the Natives must do it. Let' sshow' em what we got. Let' s show how we do it rez style. Speed, brawn, brains, skillsis what the Nativves need to success in the B- Ball game. there must be a taste andsense for the rock.When it is near or when it is far. When it is in my hand or when it' s in my closet athome. The tastes of the sweat as you bring it up the court. The feel of the leather orrubber on your fingertips, as it is shot, passed, ar evenb stolen. When it is stolen,don' t let it get you down. It just shows you need more practice. Practice makesperfect. But perfect is impossible. But it can be pursued. Pursued till your fingersbleed or till they callus. No Pain, No Gain. Can' t feel the Soreness?You ain' t gained nuthin'. Yet work it to get the skills, to get the glory. Not fameand fortune but glory. The glory. The glory of a hug from your mom or even the gloryof the lil kids wanting to shake your hand' cuz you play for the Santa Fe Indian School.BASKETBALL... BY DANIEL BEGAY
