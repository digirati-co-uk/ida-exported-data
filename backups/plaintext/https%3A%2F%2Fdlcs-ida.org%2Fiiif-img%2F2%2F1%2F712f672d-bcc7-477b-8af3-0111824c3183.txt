Page 2TEQU AYO****" ON THE ROAD TO SANTA FE ‚ÄùThe Student CouncilThe Student Council is one of the organizations on the campus this year.Its membership includes all members of both the Boys' Council and the Girls'Council.At the beginning of school there was much discussion about the kind oforganization there would be in the girls' department and it was decided tobuild it around a council of representatives from various groupings, and itwas thought best to consider the living groups of the dormitory as a representation rather than school grades. Also a proportionate representation oftribal groups and various types of girls was considered as well as the personalqualifications in the selection of council members. Since the original members were chosen, three have been replaced and the new members were chosenby the Council and approved by the girls' adviser. The purpose of this Council is to function as a discussion group on problems of dormitory and campus life among the girls, and help to develop a program that will meet theneeds and desires of the girls.The purpose of the Boys' Council is to develop a public sentiment forbetter conditions and a more adequate recreational and social program.Thursday night of each week has been set aside as council night. There arethirty- two members representing the different tribes in the school, and theofficers are: Ramon Sanchez, president; Pamfilo Montoya, vice president; TonyArchuleta, secretary.
