1NARRATIVE8Section 3.SchoolsAnnual Report1914Jicarilla AgencyNew Mexico.There are three schools on the reservation, oneboarding with a capacity of 108, and two day schools withcapacity of 25 and 30 respectively.The day school atLa Jara, eighteen miles south of the Agency, has not beenopened for two years on account of the scarcity of childrenin the neighborhood, and the day school at Dulce, only oneand one half miles from the boarding school, was closedDecember 14, 1913, after the teachers' quarters and kitchenand wash- room for the pupils were destroyed by fire.The boarding school has been filled beyond itscapacity somewhat, but I feel that better results areobtained there in every way.These Indians are very poorand do not take proper care of their children nor give themthe proper food where they attend day school.Moreover,they hear a mixture of Apache and Mexican talk while outof school and do not progress as rapidly in their studiesas the children at the boarding school.There has been more actual progress made in the gradesat the boarding school during the past year than in anyyear since it was established, and a very marked improvementis found in the confidence of the pupils in themselves.
