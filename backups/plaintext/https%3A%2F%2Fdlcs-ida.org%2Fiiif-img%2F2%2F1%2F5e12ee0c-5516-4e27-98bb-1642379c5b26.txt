There wereno epidemics, either here or out on the reservation. A fewisolated cases of chicken pox were reported.No deaths occurred among the school children.The general sanitary conditions of the reservation inand around the Indian homes are not as satisfactory as theymight be but there is a gradual improvement.The medical work during the year has been the mostsatisfactory since the establishment of the agency and school.Many of the Indians, especially the younger ones, are beinggradually drawn away from their superstitions and the influence of the medicine man.A number have submitted to oporations. It will, however, be many years before the influence ofthe medicine man ceases to be a potent factor in preventingthe advancement of the Navajo Indians.Special effort has been made during the past year to instruct the Indians in matters pertaining to hygienio living.but we have only one physician to look after 8,000 Indians,and as much has not been accomplished as there should havebeen.
