10-22( a) Systematic supervision has been given to theplayground activities, largely along the linen laid downin 1915-16 by the Day School Inspector.19. This depends upon the stand taken by theGovernment relative to attendance.For a obild merelyto finish the primary course in the day schools and thendiscontinue his schooling does not do him much good.As long as the Government does not require every normalchild to continue in school until he has finished atleast the pre- vocational course, the day sohools inthis jurisdiction will bave to be continued indefinitely.Most certainly they will have to be continued until theIndian is willing to pay taxes and to send his childrento school regularly throughout the school year withoutbeing compelled to do so.20. I wish to all attention to the need of allowingpupils under the 4th Grade to enter the Albuquerque School,There are no sobools at Canoncito, Puertocito or at theSandia Pueblo and consequently no way by which the childrencan reach the 4th Grade and qualify to enter theAlbuquerque School. They refuse to enter other schoolsand should be allowed to come to Albuquerque.
