( a) Systematic supervision has been given to the
playground activities, largely along the linen laid down

Government relative to attendance.
For a obild merely
to finish the primary course in the day schools and then
discontinue his schooling does not do him much good.
As long as the Government does not require every normal
child to continue in school until he has finished at
least the pre- vocational course, the day sohools in
this jurisdiction will bave to be continued indefinitely.
Most certainly they will have to be continued until the
Indian is willing to pay taxes and to send his children
to school regularly throughout the school year without
being compelled to do so.
20. I wish to all attention to the need of allowing
pupils under the 4th Grade to enter the Albuquerque School,
There are no sobools at Canoncito, Puertocito or at the
Sandia Pueblo and consequently no way by which the children
can reach the 4th Grade and qualify to enter the
Albuquerque School. They refuse to enter other schools
and should be allowed to come to Albuquerque.
