Indian Agency
Section 5
Allottments
Following Executive Order of February 11, 1887, setting aside
the Jicarilla Indian Reservation, approximately
130,000 acres
were allotted to 845 individuals. Difficulties confronting the
De partment in recognition and identification of living allottees,
after an excessive death rate, lead to the cancellation of these
former allottments. The Act of March 4, 1907, authorized the
cancellation of these former allottments and granted authority
for reallotting, with timber to be reserved as tribal property
during the trust period. The sale of timber therefore gives
returns as tribal, and not individual property.
Agricultural allottments were limited to 23 to 10 acres and graz
ing range from 160 to 400 acres. More than half of the original
allottees are dead. Most of the estates are probated but no land
sales have been made. Surplus land is still held as private
property and none of the reservation has been opened to settle
ment.
