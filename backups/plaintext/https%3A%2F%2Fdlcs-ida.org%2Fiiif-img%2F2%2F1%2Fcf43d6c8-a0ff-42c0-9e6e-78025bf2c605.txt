Hon.' com. of I.A. -2-.nry business, that he know was attending to his business, and coulddo so without my assistance.I have been thoroughly convinced for a long time, as has overyone who has come in contact with ir. Vincent, both Indians and whitepeople, that he was not the right man for the work, and that thework would be seriously impeded by being under such a man.I have hesitated to make any roport of this matter as the Department seemed to have intended that the work should beentirelyindependent of the Agent; but I feel now that in justice to the Indians, who have already sufferod loss or crops and will suffer moreif he is continued in charge, and to the interests of the GovernmentI would be neglecting my duty if I kopt silent any longer.If permitted to make a suggestion in this matter I would recomnondthat a youngenergetic Army Officer be placed in charge of tho workas they are accustomed to deal with Indians, are used to the rough11fe necessary to one who prosecutos the work with the energy withwhich it should be prosecuted, and the amount of the salary of theEngineer would be saved to the Indians. If the work goes on as it isgoing now this will be a very large item from the appropriation.Very respectfully, your obedient servant,Al Plumumes,1st Lieut. 10th Inf. Acting Agont.
