filled with a nurse who could do laboratory work too, it would
be a great help.
The clerical work of both the doctors and nurses is up to
date.
Nurses' quarters:
The nurses are quartered in a modern house with all the
modem conveniences. Each one has her own room. In one of
the rooms there are two bede, one of which is for the acconmode
tion of guests.
In the winter time the heating plant is taken care of by
one of the regular fi remen. Their refrigerator is taken care
of by one of the male attendants. The needed repairs are talcon
cazo or by the engineering staff or by the carpenter.
Hospital Help:
Not considering the nurses we have six helpers plus a
cook and a laundrese. In the kitchen we have two girls for
washing dishes and serving trays and doing odd jobs as they
arise.
In the ward we have to malo attendants and two female
attendants. Whenever the occasion arises we use one of then
as a seamstress for repairing, mending and any new work as
hemning, ete.
Improvements Made:
other than a few minor repairs there were no Improvemonts
made, no new buildings and no renovations,
We have made our annual attempt to get the grass to grow
in front of the hospital, and at present the re is only a sug
gestion of grass. Flowers seem to do fairly well.
Operating Room:
In our operating room we have an instrument tray, Instru
ment cabinet, Operating table, auction machine, stationary
ceiling light and an emergency light which is operated from a
battery whon the agency cenerator is not running.
The X- ray is in good working oner. During the year 10
was moved out from the wall about four feet to make room for a
11tter to be moved in along side the X- ray table. This reduces
the handling of the patient to a minimm. During the year we
also purchased a new X- ray tube. It has a capacity of 50 M A for
four seconds, which malces 1t sufficiently powerful for our
Oninary work.
