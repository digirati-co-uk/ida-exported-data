The Hogan School
March
21,
We had hauled some clay, and sand up to the hogan, as
we thought that our hogan needed plastering over, and fixing
up in the Spring. Some of the children came in with the
suggestion," Weare going to make over the hogan, fix it up."
Others said," Let us start plastering the hogan."
I told
them that I thought we would soon have the water piped up to
the hogan, and we better wait so we would not have to carry
the water so far.
I asked them if they knew of other things we might
do to fix up our hogan." Would you like to have your school
hogan more like your home?" This seemed to please them, and
most of them s√°id," Yes" So I asked what they could do to
make it that way.
Roy" Make fence and plant corn."
" Make shade house outside for weaving."
Andy" Make hole in the top of the hogan like Navajo."
Marcelino" lake a skylight."
I told them that they had made the hogan, but there
were some things in the hogan they had not made. If it was
to be a real Hogan School, they ought to have the things in
it they had made themselves. They suggested that they had
not made the tables and chairs.
Miss M.-" What would you do if you did not have the
tables and chairs?"
