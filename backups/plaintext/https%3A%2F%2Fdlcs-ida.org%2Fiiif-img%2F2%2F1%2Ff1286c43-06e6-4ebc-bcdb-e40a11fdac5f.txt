Their ideas were different compared to other classes. They got together to make a movie.No ordinary plays were for this class. They worked hard and became a“ family ” by sharing the struggles of making a movie with a messagefor their generation.The years they were young,yelling and screaming under the sun!Time passed by,Looking back at the years,brought back many tears.Going to the seventh grade,was a big scare!Now on to the eighth,I wonder what it' s like there.A lot to experience,A lot to share.Wondering who would care,and always be there.Trying to succeed,Where there is a need.Now on to the ninth,A freshman I would beI just can' t see what,school means to me!A sophomore? It just can' t be.I see what I see.But it can' t be me!Oh wow! I am almost there!Now I am a Junior.Now it' s getting clear.Trying to succeed,To be all I can be.Uh- oh my senior year.It' s here!Walking down that pathway.Look out world.Get out of my way!All those years of frustration,Took up all my concentrationNow changes take place,Time to see a new face!All these years,All those tears!Together I wish we could stay.Taking all the pain away.But it' s time to say good- bye.Now my friend,Now don' t you cry!We will meet again somedayAnytime if not today.So in this time,Just wait and pray.We will both see each other,again, someday.Gayle DeutsaweDO117
