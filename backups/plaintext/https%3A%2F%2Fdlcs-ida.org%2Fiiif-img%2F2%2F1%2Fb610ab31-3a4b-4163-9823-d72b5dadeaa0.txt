In reply to yours of the 13th inst., as< ing about pill of
lacing,# 2305, I have to say that the B.L. is here, but by the in
Horsemonts
upon it, as well as upon the invoice of the yoo' s themselves
which the bill covers, it appears that this s ne box w s carried on
another B., which was completed,
and if this bo the case, you have
already received
pay.rent for this 13 1s. of freight, and this one is
no more than a duplicate
for the same box of goods,
In any event I
am compelled to write to the Indian Offire and find out whether or not
I a. correct in my opinion respecting this matter, and if not I will
o" course complete this one,
Respect wlly
tours
supt. Spi Disjont.
