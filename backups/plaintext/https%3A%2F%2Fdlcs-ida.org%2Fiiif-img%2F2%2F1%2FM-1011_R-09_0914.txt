of the greatest needs of the school, as the old dining
hall was about to fall down.
A second story was added to the school house and
the first story was remodelled, making the building now a
first class school house, with ten class rooms, a library
ad an office, beside wide and spacious halls and stairways.
The uilding is well lighted, and it is expected to heat it
from the central heating plant.
A new boiler house of native stone was constructed
during the year and three new boilers of 80 H. P. each were
installed. it was the intention to lay pipe to the larger
buildings at the school so that they might be heated from
this boiler house, but funds did not permit the extension of
the systen further than the girls building. It is now the
expectation to extend the steam lines to the schoolhouse, and
the new dining heall and kitchen so that they may be connected
with the central heating plant.
It is also the intention to extend a 2" high pressure
steam line to the laundry and kitchen from the boiler house,
and discontinue the use of the small boiler at the laundry,
which is old and much out of repair.
As a result of the fire in liany, which destroyed the
barns, new dairy and horse barns are needed, and it is hoped
an appropriation for these buildings will be secured when Con
gress meets in December.
SÅ³eeping porches are needed at the boys dormitories
and also additional sleeping porches should be provided at the
girls building
.
