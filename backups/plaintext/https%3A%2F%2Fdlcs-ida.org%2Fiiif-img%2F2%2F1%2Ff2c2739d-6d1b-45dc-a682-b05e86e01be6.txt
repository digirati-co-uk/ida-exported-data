. 14.Section III- Schools- Continued.The Bernalillo boarding school, conducted by the Sistersof Loretta, takes care of about ninety pupils. This school is wellequipped and does good work.The moral tone of the pupils at end ing the boardingschool is excellent and there have been no moral Ãžapes duringthe three years I have been Superintendent and for some time previous there to. Our girls are ladylike and our boys are gentle.manly.The morality in the pueblos is not as good as it shouldbe but will average high in comparason with other Indians. Thereis a gradual improvement along these lines and old settlers inform me that conditions are much better than they were twentyfive years ago.There are in the neighborhood of 450 pupils not enrolled in any school. This condition is partly due to the lackof accommodations at Acoma and McCarty' s, partly due to the factthat the compulsory age under the territorial law is limited toseven to fourteen years, and to the fact that the Indians makeconsiderable use of their children as laborers after they attainthe age of fourteen. The Pueblo pupils are easily disciplinedand the Navajos generally are. There have been no incorrigiblespupile in the boarding school or in any day school.The returned students look after themselves and eitherbecome farmers, stockmen, or find labor in the shops of the railroadcompany. Some of them take positions in the Indian service andwith few exceptions they do well and their example is good.
