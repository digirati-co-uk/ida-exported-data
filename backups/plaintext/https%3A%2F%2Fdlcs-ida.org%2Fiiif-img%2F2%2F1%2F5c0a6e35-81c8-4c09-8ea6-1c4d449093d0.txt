RememberingMy GrandmaHONOSTREET SHOESON GYM, FLOORFrybread ManAll our lives they teach usThey need not be alivefor us to learn from themI remember uncle speaking of howthe smell of skunksreminded him of grandmaand how even nowyou can still see her spiritin the rabbits and skunkswhich graze from her handGrandma was the sound of rainswift and bold as thunderwhen she struckwet and turgid with loveand clouding mewith Pojoaque traditionsHer spiritlike the smoke of her cigaretteoften comes to me —I see her turquoise riviereher cigarette lit but never smokeddangling ash three incheshanding on to the fireLike grandma in rabbits and skunksGrandma' s body burns in soil, nowbut her smoke driftsin my heart and mindI inhale her desirefor the pueblo to prosperI exhale prayers for bounding —peace for the timid —roaming rabbitsand the night prowling skunksbeside the Pojoaque riverthat holds her now.— Mike LopezANTAFE INDIANSCHOOLHOMEOF THEBRAVESKim M. and Jay JayWinner of the New Mexico State Poetry Society97
