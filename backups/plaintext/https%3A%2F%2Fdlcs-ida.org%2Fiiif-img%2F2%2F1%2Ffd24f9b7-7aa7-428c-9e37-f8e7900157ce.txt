The Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
Sir:
I transmit her ewi th a report of U. S. Indian Inspector
Tink or, upon the affairs of the Moqui School, Keam's Canon, Arizona
This report shows that this school will never be a suc
cess
under the present management, and that the Indians are oppose
posed to sending their children to school while the present Super
intendent and Teacher rema in in charge.
The number of pupils in this school on March 17, is
reported to be 12 boys, 4 of whom were paid apprentices, leaving
8 school pupils.
The cost of the employes at this school agere
gates$ 6,700 per annum.
It is believed that with a competent Superintendent and
Teacher, this school can be filled and made a succe88, if not it
should be closed.
The Department will not authorize the contin
uance of any school that costs from$ 300 to$ 800 per annum per
pupil, for employes alone.
I request that this matt er receive your early attention,
