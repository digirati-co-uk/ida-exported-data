SECTION IIISCHOOLS:The relationship existing between the publicschool in this locality and the Indian school has beenvery pleasant indeed. A new public school building hasbeen constructed at Leupp during the year for the enrollmentof Indian children and the children of the employees.Another public school has been established at CanyonDiablo for the enrollment of Indian pupils and planshave been discussed and partially formulated for theestablishment next year of a public school at Indian Wells.The se three public schools, together with the Indian schoolat Leupp, provide facilities for the education of approximately475 Indian children. With reference to the needs of theschool, I believe that indications of the present year,in connection with the floods by the Little Colorado River,are such as to preclude recommendations for any additionalpermanent improvements in the way of buildings and so forth.Additional class rooms are very urgently needed and if theschool plant could be made safe from floods, such roomsshould be provided at the earliest possible date.No school farm is maintained here, dur to the la ckof irrigation. In view of the fact that this school carriesour pupils only through the seventh grade, there have beenno graduates. There are no mission or contract schoolsunder the control of the Superintendent.There is a number of Indian children of school a geon the reservation who are not in school. Plans are madeto enroll as many pupils each year as space permits.Additional school facilities, however, are required in orderto enroll all children of school age. The condition ofreturned students may be said to be good, considering thepresent standards of living among the Nava jos. Many ofour returned students have adopted a great many of thethings they learned in school, while others have simplygone back to reservation life and are giving no thoughtto the teachings of the school which they attended. It isbelieved that it is a prove ss of elimination, and that assoon as the older generation of Indians is gone, many oftheir p esent superstitions and ideas will go with them,and the younger generation will adopt ideas and teachingsof the White Man and the degree in which they adopt the seideas and teachings will become greater as education
