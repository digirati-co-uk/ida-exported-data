and it is being used under supervision where it is in a state of
repair that will justify its use. The equipment is badly worn
and in some cases cannot be used because of its condition. There
is danger of the boys and girls hurting themselves. This is some
thing that is needed for our new schools, but furniture and other
equipment in the schools is a greater need at the present time.
The boys and girls of the day schools are appro ximately of the

Government to maintain schools for the Indians of this State.
The Pueblo people are a peculiar problem and have been since
the United states acquired this territory after the Mexican War.
The status of the Indian citizen in the State of New Mexico will

hope of placing the schools wholly under the jurisdiction of
the State.
