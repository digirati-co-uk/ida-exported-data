NorthernPueblosAgencySanta Fe, N. M.SECTION IVINDUSTRIES.1. We have what is known as the five- year- program onwhich a record is kept of crops, production, etc.Thereis no well set moral plan inasmuch as every Indian issupposed to be an upright and moral man, a church memberand a good citizen. Of course there are exceptions tothis rule, but at the present writing there is no Indianin jail or in the penitentiary from the Northern Pueblos.2.( a) Conditions are at present 100% better than theywere a year ago, but same is not due to any action or efforton the part of this office or the Indian particularly, butdue to the fact that there is an abundance of rain and theland is well watered and crops are looking fine.( b)Prospects are excellent; frequent rains andfull streams are contributing much.( c) Clean seed wheat was sold at Taos this yearto improve their wheat crop. A good supply ofgarden vegetable seeds was bought for San Juan andSanta Clara.( a) Gardens and crops have not been affected bydisease or insects.( e) The products of the pueblos are largely consumed in the various villages: the surplus is soldto the near- by traders.( 1) The Pueblos are wise in the saving of allsorts of seeds, which is an old custom existingamong the Pueblos and dates back to the time whenthey lived in cliffs, to keep some seed corn inorder to anticipate any extreme drought.( g)No greenhouse or nursery at this agency.( h) No seed has been tested for planting.3. Indians have no allotted or unallotted lands: eachIndian owns his own individual tract.4. No special effort is necessary along these lines:various Indians are being helped as occasion demands.5. Each Indian has the necessary farm equipment; much ofsame has been bought on the reimbursable plan. Indians takefairly good care of their farm machinery.
