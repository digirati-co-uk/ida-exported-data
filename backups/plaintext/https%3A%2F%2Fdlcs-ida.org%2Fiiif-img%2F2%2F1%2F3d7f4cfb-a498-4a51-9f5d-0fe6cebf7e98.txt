# 8ment of governor inade for one year and dates from January letment of governor is made for one year and dates from January 1stof each year.. As a rule, the younger generation that has beeneducated and is more progressive has the least to say in themanagement of their affairs and I believe if the old system wasbroken up and if they had a local government, the governor ortheir officials should be elected by the Pueblo, which would resultin more progress among the people.I shall take occasion to communicate with the office fromtime to time as things arise that I think will justify my doing so,hence will not add anything more to this report.Respectfully submitted.Allhuchpornitura
