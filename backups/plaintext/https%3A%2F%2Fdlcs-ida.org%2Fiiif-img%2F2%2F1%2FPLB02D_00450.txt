OOC 0 PYHon. W11iam D. MitchellAugust 2, 1929.--in no sense be considered as an evidence of his good faith claimto the land during the whole statutory period. We feel that thematter should be decided by the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates in order to settle the matter for all time.We are not advocating the adoption of the Phillips'rule, because we feel that it also is too favorable to the adverseclaimant. We quoted it here merely for comparison. On appealthe Appellate Court would have the Neblett rule and the Phillips'rule to consider, and might adopt a different one altogether. Wefeel that an attempt should be made to present a third theoryto the Appellate Court that would be more of a protection to theIndian title; namely, that the period within which the claimantbe allowed to pay his taxes and with the publication of thedelinquent tax 11st and the incurring of the penalty for delinquenttaxes.We are sending this letter in the hope that anindependent outside opinion might help you in determining the policyof your Department in this regard.Very sincere y yours,HANNA& WILSON,by/ SGD/ Dudley CornellDC: IB
