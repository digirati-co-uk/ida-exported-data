Peter the P lice Dog is very clean. He goes bathing
like we do. He swims in the ocean. He runs out and shakes
himself. He runs in the water again. His mother does
not scold him to make him be clean.
Jose Domingo
Prince is a horse.
He is a clean horse.
He does not
want to drink dirty water. Prince won't drink muddy
water from the brook. He likes to drink water fron the
well. We give him water in a pail.
