Calls the attention of the Department to the
building of an irrigating dam and ditch.
The
dam is built on a dry run where no water can be
had until another spring, and not then unless
there should be a large fall of rain or snow.
The last rain and snow storm which lasted more
than 30 continuous hours, did not cause water
of any account to run into the pond, not enough
to reach the gate or discharge.
It is made upon
dirt( sand) not going to the bed rock, and what
water it catches in a very short time settles
into the sand out of sight.
The dam and
ditch are both very poorly constructed, and will
not answer the purpose for which they were built.
Recommends that not another dollar be expended
