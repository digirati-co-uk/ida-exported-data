Last vacation a great many of thera refused to return their children to the boarding school even thoughtheir time of enrollment had not exp√©ied. In cases where theenrollment had not expired, I sent two employes and broughtthe pupils in. I had a number of the Indians indicted forrefusing to send their children to any school. The effecthas been very good and resulted in more Isleta childrenbeing in school during the year than ever before, and in theparents being better satisfied with the schools. Theyseemed to have the opinion that they could not be compelledunder the law to educate their children, but as soon asthey were shown that they could be forced to place theirchildren in school, they appeared to be happy and pleasedand the result has been satisfactory. Some difficilty along this line has attended the work at San Felipe but Ifeel confident that the outcome will be satisfactory.The boarding school physician attends the pueblosof Isleta, San l' elipe, Santa Ana and San Dia and theCanon Cito Navajos, and is able to cover the entire fieldvery well. The physician at Laguna has charge of theLagunas and Acomas and has covered the field, but it hastalen all of his time.- 10
