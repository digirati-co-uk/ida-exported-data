Impressionsin PrintOnly the LonelyTo be in the wilderness I feel free.Standing alone like the tallest pine tree.It is the only place I feel at home.Standing on a mountain top, all alone.Roaming the mountains like a lonely bear.Knowing no one would know, no one would care.Where no one will invade my privacy.Where nobody would come to bother me.This place that I sure love with all of my heart.This place I dwell I feel I am a part.This place is my home in which I shall rule.Where no one can tell me what I should do.I love this place so, that I call it mine.To walk all alone, where I spend my time.â€” Sammy GeronimoWestern WorldAll the cowboys stand beside the stable,Awaiting to be called to the table.As the cowboys dismount all the horses,Their Stetson' s are blown with all wind' s forces.When dusk approaches it' s time to break camp,At the early dawn, the ground becomes damp.It' s only good for the majestic one,For the growth of alfalfa to feed on.Nature alone creates them big and strong,As the new world comes, it won' t be too long.With future techniques they' ll all be extinct,In western world it' ll make cowboys think.What can be done' bout this frightening case?What will be left on the strong cowboy' s face?ClariceAragon
