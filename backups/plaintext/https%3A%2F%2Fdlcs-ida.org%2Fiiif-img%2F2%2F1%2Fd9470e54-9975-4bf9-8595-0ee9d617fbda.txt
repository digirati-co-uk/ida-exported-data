Considering the immense increase in wages to irregular labor,
the high cost of materials, the advance of freight rates and
especially that of Indian wagon rates on the reservation, this
outfit of buildings could not be duplicated now for double the
amount.
During the period of War, the construction and repair work of
the reservation was greatly hampered. Several employees were
dra: from the work and it was found quite impossible to keep
irregular laborers. The General Mechanic endeavored to complete
the schedule set for him and employed a number of returned
students. This situation still continues. It is not to be
expected that returned students will do the work of skilled
mechanics, and the schedule of work has suffered.

Enlargement of field ma tron's laundry at Oraibi;
