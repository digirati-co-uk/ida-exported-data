HOPI INDIAN AGENCY
ANNUAL REPORT
NARRATIVE SECTION
Section I......
..Law and Order
The present Agency buildings, equipment, etc. are ef
ficient and sufficient, but we need a police headquarters or
a building which would house police. At the present we have
no police headquarters or building which may be used for
this
purpose
.
We have no Federal buildings any place near
us which might be used in our work.
On account of the heavy work at this Agency in caring
for six school plants and a vast amount of Agency papers,
records, etc., we very badly need an additional clerk or
stenographer. At the present it is necessary that the Super
intendent spend too much of his time in the office on office
work. This is necessary in order to keep the work up. We
have never had enough office help to do the work properly,
efficiently, and on time.
To keep proper law and order on the reservation is a
large problem, probably our most important problem. The na
tive police force is not very efficient in this respect.
They would be if they had a white chief. What we need to
assist us to better results is the extension of State laws
governing misdemeanors to cover this reservation, and a white
chief to direct the native polico.
Practically the only serious crime or offense committed
by our Indians the past year is that of rape. We have sent
a number to the penitentiary for this orime. The next seri.
ous offense now committed by our Indians is the refusal of
many of the younger ones to marry legally, in accordance with
the laws of the State. This is a serious handicap to these
Indians. If we are ever to accomplish anything towards ult
imately getting these Indians into State citizenship we must
have better home conditions. No progress along that line can
be made until there are some laws which cover these and si
milar cases. This is one of the greatest needs of these
Indians. With such laws it would be easy for them to make
