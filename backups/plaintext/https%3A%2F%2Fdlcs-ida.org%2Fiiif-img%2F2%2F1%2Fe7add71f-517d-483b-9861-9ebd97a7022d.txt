Section IV- Industries( cont.)
The Indians are looking forward to the logging
and lumbering industry, as being of great benefit to them, when
the timber is sold on the reservation.
During the past year, the farmers have been
employed in instructing the Indians in farming; sowing, irrigation,
harvesting crops, etc. Some of the time has been spent in over
seeing Indian labor, in repairing roads and building bridges.
The licensed trader, in my judgment, should be
continued on this reservation, as it is an advantage, in the way,
of keeping the Indians at home and away from the little Mexican
towns where liquor can be purchased. And the dealings with the
Indians are under constant supervision of the Superintendent.
The Government sawmill was installed during
the summer of 1910, at a cost of about$ 2500.00. Many nec sessary
attachments was not purchased for the Sawnill at this time, but
during the year they have been supplied, which equips the mili,
for manufacturing all lumber needed for the agency, school and
the Indians. Also, enables us to meet the demand of local trade,
The sawmill and machinery has been inclosed, with a frame building,
and a suitable cabin has been erected for the Sawyer and Engineer.
The installting and operation of the sawmill, to date, has been
expensive, principally caused by the employee force not being
sufficient, and with the addition of two more laborers, with better
salaries, the mill could be operated on a paying basis.
On the reservation, within fifteen miles of the
agency, there is one cliff dwelling or Aztec ruin, but of no
great importance.
