Pueblo Bonito So hool
Annual Report 1919
Law and Order
The close of this fiscal year finds the new dining
hall under roof, and the brick work on the enlarged school
building begun. These additions will permit the enrollment
of 100 more children than it has been possible to enroll under
present conditions. The day school at Pine dale has not been
in session since March, as it was impossible to secure a teacher
and house ke eper for the salary paid. It is difficult to secure
regular attendants on account of the distance that some children
must travel to get to the school, and during the winter months
deep snow interferes with the attendance. Therefore it is hard
to secure good results.
The work in the Agency and School Office has steadily
increased, and it has been impossible to keep the work up to
date, though a third clerkship has been authorized for two
months which will relieve for the time being the pressure of
work, and an effort is being made to complete our records up
to date.
The sale of whiskey since prohibition
has gone into
effect has materially diminished, which is to the betterment
of the Navajoes. The Indians do not manufacture any intoxicat
ing drinks from Peyote or other ingredient. The Mexicans are
white people, so far do not manufacture or use any home made
intoxicating
concoction
. Only five police, private, and one
chief are allowed this jurisdiction
to preserve order, and this
force is too small for such a large area to be covered.
