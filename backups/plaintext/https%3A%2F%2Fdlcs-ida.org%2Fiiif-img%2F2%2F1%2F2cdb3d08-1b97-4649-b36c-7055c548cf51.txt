O0April 12, 13,Some of the girls worked on the skin. They seemedto like to comb the hair to make it look clean and pretty.Some of the skins seer bo be tanned quite well, so thatthey are soft and white. Others do not seem to soften upvery well. The skins, on which we used the sulphuric acidmethod look and feel the best. It takes a great deal ofwork, and the children seem to be getting tired of workingon them. They think they are good enough to sit on without any more work on them,Our floor cracked, so some of the boys had to plastor1t over. The clay is not satisfactory. It has to be mixedtith sand. We plastered it over using four parts sand, andone of clay. Even then it had cracked same, but we took thecracks out by using heavy boards or weights to temper it.We run a heavy roller over it, to make it flat and hard.April 16,This morning we worked on the floor to see that itwas all packed down hard. Then we finished cleaning, scraping and combing the skins. We brought them up to our hogan,and each found a place to sit on the floor. I noticed before the day was over, some were sitting on a box or onthe shell. They didn't like to admit that they were tiredof sitting on the floor. I said," Isn't that the way yousit at home?" Harry answered," We lie down on the floor,when we are at home.We painted designs on the lapboards.
