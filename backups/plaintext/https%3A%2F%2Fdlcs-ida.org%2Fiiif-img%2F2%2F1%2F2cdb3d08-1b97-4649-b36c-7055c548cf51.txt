Some of the girls worked on the skin. They seemed
to like to comb the hair to make it look clean and pretty.
Some of the skins seer bo be tanned quite well, so that
they are soft and white. Others do not seem to soften up
very well. The skins, on which we used the sulphuric acid
method look and feel the best. It takes a great deal of
work, and the children seem to be getting tired of working
on them. They think they are good enough to sit on with
out any more work on them,
Our floor cracked, so some of the boys had to plastor
1t over. The clay is not satisfactory. It has to be mixed
tith sand. We plastered it over using four parts sand, and
one of clay. Even then it had cracked same, but we took the
cracks out by using heavy boards or weights to temper it.
We run a heavy roller over it, to make it flat and hard.

This morning we worked on the floor to see that it
was all packed down hard. Then we finished cleaning, scrap
ing and combing the skins. We brought them up to our hogan,
and each found a place to sit on the floor. I noticed be
fore the day was over, some were sitting on a box or on
the shell. They didn't like to admit that they were tired
of sitting on the floor. I said," Isn't that the way you
sit at home?" Harry answered," We lie down on the floor,
when we are at home.
We painted designs on the lapboards.
