tubercular
cases
mentioned
we had
little
serious
illness
.
Three
hundred
twenty
pupils
were
admitted
to the
hospital
during
the
entire
year
. Employees
have
been
watchful
of the health
of pupils
in their
charge
and
their
coopera
tion
resulted
in prompt
detection
of cases
of incipient
tuberculosis
.
The teeth
of the
pupils
have
received
careful
atten
tion
by proper
use
of brushes
and
powder
but
quite
a
number
of extractions
have
been
necessary
as no field
dentist
has
visited
the
school
during
the
last
two years
.
Ninety
- six
cases
of trachoma
were
operated
and
received
after
treatment
. Six
of these
were
acute
infec
tions
arising
in the
school
. They
may
have
occurred
through
ordinary
contact
or may
have
been
due
to the
I
shortage
oỉ toweling
early
in the
school
year
. Just
before
the close
of school
a few cases
of pink
eye developed
but
.
not
a sufficient
number
to be termed
an epidemic
.
No deaths
occurred
at the
school
during
the year
. One
pupil
returned
home
and
later
died
.
