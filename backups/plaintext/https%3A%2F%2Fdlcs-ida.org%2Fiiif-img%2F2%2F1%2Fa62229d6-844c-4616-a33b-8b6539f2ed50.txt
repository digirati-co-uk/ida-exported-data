April 20,This morning we wrote stories about the things we haddone for our Hogan School. We wrote the following stories:" Our Wooden Pegs."," Our Desks."" The Hogan Porch Floor."" Plastered the Wall."" Hogan Paintings."We are working on our last group of skins. We put thesulphuric acid and salt on some for tanning. Some we aretaking the hair off by using slacked lime. We rubbedneatsfoot oil on those skins we had already tanned.We put stain on some more of the lapboards.Westill have a few more to finish. The children say thatthey like to write on the folding desks rather than thelapboards.April 23,We continued to work on tanning the skins. We triedto scrape the hair off of those we had in the slacked lime.It did not come off very easy on some of them, so we putthem back in the lime. we dissolved the alum and salt inthe water for the tanning process.We washed the skins that had been treated with thesulphuric acid and hung them up to dry.After we returned to the Hogan, the boys told thegirls about the work they had done on the skins. Thenwe wrote the story of our work to put in our Class RecordBook. We decided that it would be nice to keep a diary,then each child could take their diary book home, andremember about the work we had done for our Hogan School.
