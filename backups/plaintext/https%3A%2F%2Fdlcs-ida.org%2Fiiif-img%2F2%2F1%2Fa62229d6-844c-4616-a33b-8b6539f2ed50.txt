April 20,
This morning we wrote stories about the things we had
done for our Hogan School. We wrote the following stories:
" Our Wooden Pegs."
," Our Desks."
" The Hogan Porch Floor."
" Plastered the Wall."
" Hogan Paintings."
We are working on our last group of skins. We put the
sulphuric acid and salt on some for tanning. Some we are
taking the hair off by using slacked lime. We rubbed
neatsfoot oil on those skins we had already tanned.
We put stain on some more of the lapboards.
We
still have a few more to finish. The children say that
they like to write on the folding desks rather than the
lapboards.

We continued to work on tanning the skins. We tried
to scrape the hair off of those we had in the slacked lime.
It did not come off very easy on some of them, so we put
them back in the lime. we dissolved the alum and salt in
the water for the tanning process.
We washed the skins that had been treated with the
sulphuric acid and hung them up to dry.
After we returned to the Hogan, the boys told the
girls about the work they had done on the skins. Then
we wrote the story of our work to put in our Class Record
Book. We decided that it would be nice to keep a diary,
then each child could take their diary book home, and
remember about the work we had done for our Hogan School.
