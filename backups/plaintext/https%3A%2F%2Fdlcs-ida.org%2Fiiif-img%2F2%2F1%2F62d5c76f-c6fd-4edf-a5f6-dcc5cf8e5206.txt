01- 286- Labor.This class of patients comprise a considerablepart of the work and practically all of the Lagunas call thephysician at this time.Loss cases woro handled this yearthan last due to the fact that legg babies have been born.A little more than fifty were cared for last year while onlyforty were bared for this year.It has been the rule to givesuch 62808 the preference over most others and to handle themwith the game doliooy and technic as is used in the mostrefined private practice. There is no class of patients sograteful as this and when help is given in this, one of themost critical times of a woman's life, she rarely forgets orcoa868 to be grateful.I do not wish to become egotisticalbut I am proud of the record in this line and it has beenof the greatest aids in securing better conditions along otherlines.of the forty cases ten were complicated anddangerour procedure was required in several instances butall mothers survived and only two babies were lost as a consequence of labour conditions.No cases of infection followedlabour and all recovered fully.The belief that Indian woman have no trouble atthis time is an erroneous one as few cases are absolutelynormal.
