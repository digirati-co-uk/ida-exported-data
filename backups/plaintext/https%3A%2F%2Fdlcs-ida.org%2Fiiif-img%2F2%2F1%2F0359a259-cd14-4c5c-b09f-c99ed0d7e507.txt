185
NO. 26
Section 181, or Rules for the Indian School Service reads," It is
Ã³esirable to dispense with the use ot buckets for night service in
dormitories; it is therefore advised that a water closet for emergency
purposes be located on each floor of such buildings, and Superintendents
will give this matter consideration where adequate water and sewer
systems exist.
The closet for the boys is over 300 feet from the dormitories, and
of course cannot be used for night service, especially by the smaller
boys
The amount I ask for seems rather large, but you will notice that
it is quite a distance to the sewer and water mains, and considerable
nietance
materials and plumber labor is necessary.
In view of the fact that a dozen or more buckets are used in this
sleeping room", and knowing how
earnest your office is to have such
nuisances abolished, I most earnestly and urgently ask your early and
favorable consideration of this request,
Very respectfully,
Your obedient servanto
Athlete
Superintendent.
