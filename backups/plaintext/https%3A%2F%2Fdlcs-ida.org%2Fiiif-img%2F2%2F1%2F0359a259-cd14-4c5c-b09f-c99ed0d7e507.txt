185NO. 26Section 181, or Rules for the Indian School Service reads," It is√≥esirable to dispense with the use ot buckets for night service indormitories; it is therefore advised that a water closet for emergencypurposes be located on each floor of such buildings, and Superintendentswill give this matter consideration where adequate water and sewersystems exist.The closet for the boys is over 300 feet from the dormitories, andof course cannot be used for night service, especially by the smallerboysThe amount I ask for seems rather large, but you will notice thatit is quite a distance to the sewer and water mains, and considerablenietancematerials and plumber labor is necessary.In view of the fact that a dozen or more buckets are used in thissleeping room", and knowing howearnest your office is to have suchnuisances abolished, I most earnestly and urgently ask your early andfavorable consideration of this request,Very respectfully,Your obedient servantoAthleteSuperintendent.
