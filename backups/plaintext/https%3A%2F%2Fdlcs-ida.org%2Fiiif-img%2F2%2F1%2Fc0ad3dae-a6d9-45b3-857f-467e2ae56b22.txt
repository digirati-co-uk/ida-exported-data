Dear si
I have your note dated the 23rd instant regarding the
letter from Yairie Leeds which was inclosed.
On the 15th irst.
1 yote Yamie Leeda about this matter telling him that the Indian
Orice does not allow me to send pupils home for vacation at
Government expense, shat they were all howe last summer and some
others did not return till late in the season, so that they have
bear here but a very few months since their last vacation, and
that the enildren were all well and happy here, etc.
Ta children were 11 home last summer seation and so I
suppose they are taking it for granted that the childrer are to
be returned to them this summer, but I did not promise the Indians
this, except in one case
one boy was alloved o go home about
months ago according to previous agreement.
The Indian Office desires me to keep as many as possible of
the children here trough vacation.
Very roagectfully
