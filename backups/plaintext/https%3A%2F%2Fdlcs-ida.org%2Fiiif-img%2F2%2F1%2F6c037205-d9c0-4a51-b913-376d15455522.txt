- 25August 19, 1911,Albuquerque Indian School.NARRATIVE.Seotion- VHB- Contracts.Each pueblo has a council composed of its officerselected by the people or appointed by the cacique each year whogovern the village and look after the business interests of thepeople and pueblo. If a broad minded, intelligent man happens tobe elected for governor, the affairs of the pueblo are conductedin a broad minded, progressive, business way, but now and thenIndians who are non- progressive and hardly intelligent are selected for the chief officer. Under such conditions the progressof the people is retarded. Most of the officers have been of thebetter class and have been a help to the Superintendent in thedischarge of his official duties.The Indians under my gurisdiction receive no paymentsfrom the Government and share in no annuities.
