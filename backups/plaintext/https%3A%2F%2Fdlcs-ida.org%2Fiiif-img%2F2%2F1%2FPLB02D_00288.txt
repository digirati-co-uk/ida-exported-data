The Board believes thatif work weredone therewith a drag line similar to thatwhich has been and is being doneat or near the Puebloof Tesuque, the result would more than justify theexpense, andecomme at a po ion of the awardbe expended for this purpose.44 Practically all of the land within the Grant west of theRio Grandeand north of Santa Clara creekis nowclaimed orin possession of non- Indians. About a mile northof the Pueblovillage and near the railroad is the small nativesettlement of Guachupangue; and anotherhalf milenorthof that, is the town of Espanola. Practicallyall of the ad.verse claimants in and aroundLese se eme ts of Guachpangue and Espanola, whose ancestors, in ni–∞nycases, camehere along timeago, claim title to the lands fromtheriverto the hills; and theJoy surveyors, in 1915, surveyedandcharted these claims accordingly, markingthem on their mapsas a large number of parallelstrips, running to the westerlyboundary of the Grant. The Board has found, however,thatneither possession nooccupancy could be proven as towestern part of a majority of these claims, whichare notactually occu ied or irricated, and thereforeas awarded alarge acreage thereof tothe Indians. These landswere unfenced and but little, if ever, used. They were never exclusively possessed in themanner prescribedby the Act of June7, 1924, creatingthis Board. This acreagehas considerablegrazing value; very little of it could ever be irrigatedwithoutgreat expense, if at all.A tract comprisingabout 150 acres around Guachupangueisnon- Indian possessionand is irrigatedfrom a ditch knowas" GuachupangueJitch," aken out of theSanta ClaraCreek on its worth bank, about two miles from tue Pio Grande.Frominforination obtained by the Board from the Tradiais
