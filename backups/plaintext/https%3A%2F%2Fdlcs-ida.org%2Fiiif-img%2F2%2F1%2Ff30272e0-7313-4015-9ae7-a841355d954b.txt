Page 8NARRATIVE.Annual Report- 1915Section 11.- Health.for hospital patients are a necessity and the office shouldcontinue the authorization of such purchases. As stated heretoforeseveral additional employees are now required to take care of thisvery important work.The medical work, on the whole, is growing rapidly caused by thepresent physician at the Agency having the confidence of the leadingmen of the tribe. Indians now come for treatment voluntarily whoheretofore would not have come except by forse which is not advisable.It is no uncommon feature to have patients brought in voluntarilyto the hospitals from distances up to 100 miles.One fiela matron and assistant was authorized for this reservation the past year. The position was not filled until late in1914 and the present incumbent has asked for transfer so that thisphase of the work has not progressed as it should. It takes a fieldmatron some time to become acquainted with and obtain the confidenceof the Navajos in her section. Frequent changes in the position arevery detrimental to good results. The field matron, when opportunityoffered, visited the homes and endeavored by suggestion and practicaldemonstration to install better sanitary methods around the home.Work of the field matrons is hampered by the migratory habits ofthe Navajos who cannot remain in the same locality owing to theirherds.
