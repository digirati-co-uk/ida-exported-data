We continued to work on the skins, We are trying to get
them soft and clean, so we can take them to the Mogan,
We were to have a pionio after school, so we talkod
about the things we should do to get ready for it. Wo were
to wash our hands before cooking, and bo clean about prepar
ing our food. We also disousged being polite, When we
had finished oating, we tried to pick up all the trash and
burn it. I saw quite an improvement from the time we had
a party berore,
The girls tried to clean up the yard, We discussed
why we should clear refuse and trash away from within and
around the hogan, I asked if we just needed to do that
around this Hogan." No, all the Hogans," said George.
" All the hogans in the world," added Roy.
" Where should we put the trash?
" In the trash can or incinerator," answorod Roy.
" What if you do not have an incinerator?
" Bury 1t or burn it," said Byrd.
There had boon a number of lies in the hogan. I
suggested that they kill them, I showed them a chart show
ing an enlarged fly, and I explained how he carried r11th
and gorg on his foot. The chart also showed how he goes
from dirty places to the table or places where we keep food,
We discussed the taot that flies spread disease, and they
should be kelled. We concluded that the best way to get
ng
or fl1e8, vas to keep everything cloan and tight, so the
flies will not have breeding places.
