Wo wereto wash our hands before cooking, and bo clean about preparing our food. We also disousged being polite, When wehad finished oating, we tried to pick up all the trash andburn it. I saw quite an improvement from the time we hada party berore,The girls tried to clean up the yard, We discussedwhy we should clear refuse and trash away from within andaround the hogan, I asked if we just needed to do thataround this Hogan." No, all the Hogans," said George." All the hogans in the world," added Roy." Where should we put the trash?" In the trash can or incinerator," answorod Roy." What if you do not have an incinerator?" Bury 1t or burn it," said Byrd.There had boon a number of lies in the hogan. Isuggested that they kill them, I showed them a chart showing an enlarged fly, and I explained how he carried r11thand gorg on his foot. The chart also showed how he goesfrom dirty places to the table or places where we keep food,We discussed the taot that flies spread disease, and theyshould be kelled. We concluded that the best way to getngor fl1e8, vas to keep everything cloan and tight, so theflies will not have breeding places.
