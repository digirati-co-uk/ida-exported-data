NARRATIVE
Statistics of the Biological Survey place the average
annual destruction of each mature wolf at$ 1,000 per
annum and our knowledge of their activities on this
reservation lead us to believe that the figures are
at least conservative,
Sheep suffer heavier losses
since cats and coyotes add to the killings.
The agency saw mill turned out enough lumber to meet
reservation needs and at a price that was much below that
for several years past.
The demand for lumber for home
construction will grow from year to year and this activity
must keep in pace with the needs of the Indians who may
have the funds and inspiration to build homes that are
in keeping with their needs.
The Indian women continue to do more or less 01
basket and bead work.
Their basketry compares well
with that of other tribes and it is of quality to meet
with ready sale.
The word Jicarilla means little basket
and the return from weaving or baskets has at times been
of consequence to the
tribe in purchase of actual necessi
ties of life.
Industrial activities rightly chosen are factors
that determine the progress of a people and certainly
there is necessity
for the Indian people to take their
place in productive
work,
