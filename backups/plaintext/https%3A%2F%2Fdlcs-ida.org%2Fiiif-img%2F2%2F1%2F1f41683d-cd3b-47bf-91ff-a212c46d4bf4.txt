To that class we bow in reverence and awe.We promise to keep this key in safety. We expect to make betteruse of it than has the class of 1929.Noble Seniors, you may try to impress us with your greatness.But every Junior sees through you as he would see through a sandscreen.You appear to be perfection in all things; but the Juniors knowhow you try to get out of work. We know how you all think youshould go to every party on the campus. We see how you can get all thetrips and all the Senior dinners at the Domestic Science.You Senior boys have often missed formation. You have at timesleft dummies in your beds to deceive the officer at bed check. Youhave also slipped off to the public dance halls where you whisperedsweet nothings in the ears of some Senorita.You Senior girls have been known to smile at the Menaul boyswho attend dress parades every Sunday afternoon. In fact these boyshave worn away the auditorium steps watching you on these occasions.You cannot deny that you have encouraged such attentions.You Seniors can' t bluff us any longer. In fact you never havebluffed us. Next year we will try to take your places in June. Weare sure we can more than fill the space you now occupy.We are sure we can excell your record for greatness. However,we are better for having known you. Our associations have beenpleasant and happy, and we wish you all success and happiness.| To the Class of' 31 I would say we Juniors will keep the key.Next year we shall pass it on to you.llll|||lllllllllllllllllllllll"Illi-111-11Hill-hi11-l-llllll--llAllllllWM- WH-- HM M| ミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミーミューミーミーミーミーPage Sixty
