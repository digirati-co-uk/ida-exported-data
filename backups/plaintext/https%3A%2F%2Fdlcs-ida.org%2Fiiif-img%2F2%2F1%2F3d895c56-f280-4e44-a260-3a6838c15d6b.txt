I called the attention of Inspector Ass. Dunoan to the necuncl67
of a Department of this kind hors, and he strongly inders.d 18, and
urged me to again lay the matter before you, I feel assured that he
will refer to the mattor in his report and I moat sarnostiy ask you

The salary asked for this position( 8400. por amum) is most
reasonable and moderate one.
Under any circumstances the work of a competent person- with a
corps of assistants- in a Department of this kind, would, in one month
save more for the school, than the amount paid the employee for a whole
year, and with a condition of affairs existing, as they are at this
school, I consider the position to be an absolute necessity, and I most
earnestly and urgently ask you to further examine the natter, and give
the same your favorable consideration,
Very respectfully,
Your obedient servante

Superintendent.
