OApril 17, 18,The floor is much harder than it was before, so the dustis not so bad.The children like to say that the Nava jo way of fixingthe skins is the best. We picked up both kinds, and I askodthem which was the cleanest, and which was the softest? Theysaid that they did not fix their skins right.Harry-" 01 d men know how to do.We don't know how. Wedidn't have any brains to make very sort.After discussing the matter of spitting, we decided tohave a spittoon or spitting box, We took a round box, andfilled it with sand. We put it under the porch. They thoughtwe did not have room enough in the Hogan. We wrote a classstory about the" Hogan Spitting Box." We are going to tryto write a story about everything we do in our Hogan School,so people will know why we did it.Some of the boys raked and cleaned the yard. It hadbeen so muddy that we decided we should have a porch floorwith a scraper Some boys offered to make a floor of stones,and they filled the cracks with wet cay. They took a sharpstone and made a scraper for their feet.Each child drew designs for their lapboards. A fewpainted their designs with earth colors, but most of thempreferred to use the water colors. Then we shellaced them.We thought we had room for one more miral on ourwall. We decided that a Navajo silversmith would be nice.Several tried to draw one on paper. We picked out the best,and had Lindy draw it on the wall. Two boys helped him topaint it with earth colors.
