The floor is much harder than it was before, so the dust
is not so bad.
The children like to say that the Nava jo way of fixing
the skins is the best. We picked up both kinds, and I askod
them which was the cleanest, and which was the softest? They
said that they did not fix their skins right.
Harry-" 01 d men know how to do.
We don't know how. We
didn't have any brains to make very sort.
After discussing the matter of spitting, we decided to
have a spittoon or spitting box, We took a round box, and
filled it with sand. We put it under the porch. They thought
we did not have room enough in the Hogan. We wrote a class
story about the" Hogan Spitting Box." We are going to try
to write a story about everything we do in our Hogan School,
so people will know why we did it.
Some of the boys raked and cleaned the yard. It had
been so muddy that we decided we should have a porch floor
with a scraper Some boys offered to make a floor of stones,
and they filled the cracks with wet cay. They took a sharp
stone and made a scraper for their feet.
Each child drew designs for their lapboards. A few
painted their designs with earth colors, but most of them
preferred to use the water colors. Then we shellaced them.
We thought we had room for one more miral on our
wall. We decided that a Navajo silversmith would be nice.
Several tried to draw one on paper. We picked out the best,
and had Lindy draw it on the wall. Two boys helped him to
paint it with earth colors.
