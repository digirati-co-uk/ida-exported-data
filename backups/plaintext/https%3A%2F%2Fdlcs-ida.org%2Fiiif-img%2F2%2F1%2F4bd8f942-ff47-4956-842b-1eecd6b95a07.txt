conegoSW.To the Senior Class:A year book can serve no better purpose than torecord the activities in which one participates inschool. In later years it should recall the pleasurable experiences of class room, campus and athleticfield and should stand as a measure of' ones accomplishments in every activity which the schoolprovides.However pleasurable these experiences may havebeen at the Santa Fe Indian School, they moan nothingunless they can be interpreted as a willingness to goforward, to attack the trials of an adult life in thevery same way in which problems were approached successfully at school.If the year book bocamos a point of departurefor you in changing from school to reservation lifeall the offort wh: ch you have put forth in its prcp-.eration will not be without reward.H, C, Seymour.Superintondent of Boarding Schools.seria
