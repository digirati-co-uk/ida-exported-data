The lubricating oil is needed for immediato use in oiling" laundry
machinery and for use in engine room.
It should be purchased at ono..
The refrigerator for the hospital is a great necessity and should
be purchased without delay, as it is groatly needed for preserving
MOAT3, milk, and delicacies for the sick during the warm Sununor months.
With the amount asked for, a good strong refrigerator can be
puronased and one that will last for yoars.
Ono purchased in this
suosion for less than that amount is hardly worth having.
I respectfully ask your favorable consideration of this roquost.
Very respostfully,
