We especjally stressed oral English. Wo started out by
talking about the things they have and do at home. Of course
that was the logical place to begin, because the children are
more familiar, and interested in their homes, than anything
else. Then we made plans for our Hogan. This furnished much
opportunity for conversation for we would come together in the
morning, and talk over our plans for the day.
we would then
do the work that we thought necessary. Many times we would
have to stop while the work was in progress to correct a mis
take or make further plans. After we had finished the work
for that day, or had spent the time that we allowed for that
work, we met together in a group and talked about our success
or failures, and the reason for the later. Then perhaps we
would make further plans.
Sometimes we would have to talk about cooperation, and
the methods on working. we worked on whatever our needs were
for the interest of the group. After that I would usually
write on the board by the dictation of the children the most
important things we had accomplished that day. Then perhaps
they would write or tell about their individual experiences
in the form of a story, record or diary. from that we would
take the words they needed help with for our spelling lesson.
If we found mistakes in English in their conversation or writ
ing, we would take that up at that time. I would always stress
writing plainly, and we would sometimes practice on the words
or letters on which help was needed. Of course the program
would vary from day to day according to our needs.
