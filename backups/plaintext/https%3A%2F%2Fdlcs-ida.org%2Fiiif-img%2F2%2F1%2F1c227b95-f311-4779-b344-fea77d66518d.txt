We especjally stressed oral English. Wo started out bytalking about the things they have and do at home. Of coursethat was the logical place to begin, because the children aremore familiar, and interested in their homes, than anythingelse. Then we made plans for our Hogan. This furnished muchopportunity for conversation for we would come together in themorning, and talk over our plans for the day.we would thendo the work that we thought necessary. Many times we wouldhave to stop while the work was in progress to correct a mistake or make further plans. After we had finished the workfor that day, or had spent the time that we allowed for thatwork, we met together in a group and talked about our successor failures, and the reason for the later. Then perhaps wewould make further plans.Sometimes we would have to talk about cooperation, andthe methods on working. we worked on whatever our needs werefor the interest of the group. After that I would usuallywrite on the board by the dictation of the children the mostimportant things we had accomplished that day. Then perhapsthey would write or tell about their individual experiencesin the form of a story, record or diary. from that we wouldtake the words they needed help with for our spelling lesson.If we found mistakes in English in their conversation or writing, we would take that up at that time. I would always stresswriting plainly, and we would sometimes practice on the wordsor letters on which help was needed. Of course the programwould vary from day to day according to our needs.
