Evaluation of the present curriculumfor music.1. The favorable side.The music curriculum which I have used this year has beena helpful guide to find those things which are necessary forprogress in each level.2. The DefectsIn the curriculum for Progress Level A it was stated inActivity 5--" Discuss with the children parts of music, showpictures of instruments used in each record, show pictures11 possible of some of the characters in musio". This activityis too difficult not only for beginners but also for levelsand F. So I think this activity should be taken out of thecurriculum for Level A.In Level D it was stated in Activity 2" to learn songswith bolks in the hands of the children". In the first placewe did not have books easy enough for this level. In thesecond place, the children of this level did not have theability and background for reading the words of the songs.Observing the kinds of notes and rests, measure, bar, andsignatures, is also too difficult for this levei. Theknowledge of notation and structure, that is necessary,should be taken in the next level instead of in Lovel D.The materials listed in the Music Curriculum seemed to bewithin the abilities of the children in their ow level.But whether this curriculum meets the needs of the Nava joeshas yet to be proven.3.
