Evaluation of the present curriculum
for music.
1. The favorable side.
The music curriculum which I have used this year has been
a helpful guide to find those things which are necessary for
progress in each level.
2. The Defects
In the curriculum for Progress Level A it was stated in
Activity 5--" Discuss with the children parts of music, show
pictures of instruments used in each record, show pictures
11 possible of some of the characters in musio". This activity
is too difficult not only for beginners but also for levels
and F. So I think this activity should be taken out of the
curriculum for Level A.
In Level D it was stated in Activity 2" to learn songs
with bolks in the hands of the children". In the first place
we did not have books easy enough for this level. In the
second place, the children of this level did not have the
ability and background for reading the words of the songs.
Observing the kinds of notes and rests, measure, bar, and
signatures, is also too difficult for this levei. The
knowledge of notation and structure, that is necessary,
should be taken in the next level instead of in Lovel D.
The materials listed in the Music Curriculum seemed to be
within the abilities of the children in their ow level.
But whether this curriculum meets the needs of the Nava joes
has yet to be proven.
