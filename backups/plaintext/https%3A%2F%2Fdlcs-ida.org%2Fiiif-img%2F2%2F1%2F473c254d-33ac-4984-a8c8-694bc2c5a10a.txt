-10The only explanation the writer has for the differencein character of the water is the fact that the Gypsy well issituated at a point about 7 miles east of the outcrop ofthe Da kota sandstone against the Chus ka and BeautifulMountains. These moun ta Ä°ns carry a supply of soft freshwater from springs and melting snow which undoubtedly percolate into the Da kota and circula te below into the synclineand anticline alike, there being no accumulation of oil toexclude it from the structure. The top of the Table Mesaanticline is between 8 and 9 miles east of the Tocito, andalthough the Dakota is exposed on the flanks of the mountains mentioned in this case, the entire structure is cutoff from direct circulation and separated from the Tocitostructure by a long dike extending for a distance of approxima tely five or six miles. This fact, it is believed, accounts for the sulphur water, due to the lack of sufficientcirculation, and also to the fact that the very nature ofvolcanic intrusive materials themselves might lead to aconsiderable sulphur and mineral content in the water.The fresh water found in the Tocito sandstone at theTable Mesa well undoubtedly originates in the surface runoff from points to the north and northeast where the sandstone outcrops on the Rattlesnake and Hogback structures.COMPOSITEGEOLOGIC SECTION OF FORMATIONSWESTOF GREAT HOGBACK.The followingcomposite section gives informationconcerningthe differentformationswhich are presentinthe San Juan basin, and more particularlyin the Shiprockarea.
