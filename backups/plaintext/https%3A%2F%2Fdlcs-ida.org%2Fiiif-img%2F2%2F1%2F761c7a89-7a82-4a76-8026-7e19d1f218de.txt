deaths. It was not necessary to employ additional
nurses or physicians under the public health ath

of pneumonia. Miss Thomas was a splendid girl and
an efficient employee. One pupil died after leaving
the school and being taken to the sanitorium at La
guna. At the present time the hospital is closed.

three cases of incipient tuberculosis( where the
children were affected before enterins school) health
