made of the buildings and the schools and the methods of trans
acting business and it was not satisfactory to me.
In some lines
I think that Maj. Williams has done exceedingly well, but I think
there has been a lack of personal supervision.
I found con
siderable want of harmony existing among the employees and a seem
ing desire of many of them to shirk their duties.
The grounds
belonging to the Agency were not in good condition.
The school
at this point was not satisfactory.
I shall refer to these
matters more in detail further on.
... BUILDINGS...
By the improvements that have been added in the way of
new storehouse, office and dormitory, the efficiency has been pro
moted if the new Agent Mr. Hazlett will throw some life into the
management of affairs.
An appropriation has
been made for a
building in place of the old school building and dormitory condemn
ed.
This is all very well and perhaps needed, but the old
building has been allowed to go to ruin simply for the want of
repairs.
There has been no provision of any kind made for ex
tinguishing fires so far as I could learn.
The location of the
Agency is very good, as central perhaps as any point, although it
is very costly to the Government at present owing to the long dis
tance which all supplies have to be hauled.
I called the atten
tion of Mr. Hazlett to the order of the Honorable Commissioner of
Indian Affairs, in regard to the matter of fires and the necessity
of instituting some method for extinguishing fires, and he has
promised to comply with the order.
