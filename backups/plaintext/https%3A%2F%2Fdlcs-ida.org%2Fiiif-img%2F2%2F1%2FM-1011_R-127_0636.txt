I havegone into this ma tter at some length andfind that, in my opinion, most of the bookson the authorized list could be eliminatedwithout any detrimental results to the schools.I communicated with the Chief Supervisor ofSchools, at his request,on this matter sometwo months ago giving him titles of bookswhich, in my opinion, should be eliminated.I think the action of the Indian office inthis connection should be in the directionof adopting, in So far as possible and expedient med text books throughoutthe Service.As regards the employees, I may statethat with very few exceptions they have beenvery efficient. As regards their loyalty,I do not know of anyone' s attitude that couldbe called into question.
